The voyage from Manila took four months, with the ships in cluding in their cargo spices, ivory, porcelain, lacquerware, and processed silk. The goods were then transshipped overland to Veracruz, where they were loaded onto ships bound for Spain.

      "ground_truth": "\"The Philippine* is rich in natural resources that are as yet largely undeveloped. Its fertile plains and rich valleys produce diverse crops a few of which are produced for export and the rest for local consump¬ tion. Rice, the staple crop of the country, is produced largely in the Central Plains of Luzon, but the to tal production is not 4 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE sufficient to meet the ever in creasing demand of an exploding population. The still primitive way of agriculture is one of the causes of the failure of the Philippines to produce enough rice for export. However, a breakthrough in rice production was made during the first four years of President Ferdinand Marcos’ administration when the so-called “miracle rice” was developed. Other products, however, have been raised for export. Cop¬ ra, abaca, gums, resins, rubber, and sugar have found ready markets abroad. Lumber, minerals, and metals have been ex¬ ported in large quantities to swell Philippine exports to an average of about P 800,000,000. Mining, which is a basic in¬ dustry, produces more than 700 million pesos worth of minerals. Metallic minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, and chromium are exploited for their commercial value, while the non-metallic minerals like salt, coal, clay, as¬ bestos, sulphur, gravel, limestone, and gypsum are so far not yet exploited for large-scale export. It is suspected that oil is present in some Philippine sites, but at tempts to locate these sites have so far been unsuccessful.\"",

There must be two Americas: one that sets the captive free, and one that takes a once-captive’s new freedom away from him, and picks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to get his land.’” —Mark Twain, “To the Person Sitting in Darkness” T HE W ANING OF AN A GE: T HE S PANISH -A MERICAN W AR I N EARLY 1898, IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING C UBAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE against Spain, the United States government or dered the battleship USS Maine to Havana—a move meant to signal Spain that the U. S. sympathized with the Cuban rebels and that it in tended to protect U. S. in terests in the Caribbean island. The ship was blown up on February 15, 1898, while at anchor off Havana, killing 266 men. At the time the cause was unknown—though an in vestigation in 1976 by Admiral Hyman Rickover of the U. S. Navy determined that the explosion was an accident, caused by a faulty coal bunker—but U. S. newspapers immediately blamed the Spanish. The rallying cry for the moment was “Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!” William Randolph Hearst, owner and publisher of the New York Journal, famously said to Frederic Remington, the paper’s well-known illustrator, “You furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war!” And that Hearst and the media did. The explosion was the perfect excuse for a war, and even though Spain had of fered an immediate armistice and considerable autonomy for the Cubans, the Mc Kinley government was undeterred from its mission, declaring war on April 25. The conflict was just the right opportunity for a young giant, eager to participate in the “Great Game” of empire building. It heralded the beginning of what has since come to be known as the American Century. Even before the for mal declaration of hostilities, Theodore Roosevelt, Undersecretary of the Navy—filling in for Secretary John D. Long, who was on leave—or dered U. S. warships under the command of Commodore George Dewey to Hong Kong in late February and there await battle or ders. Once at berth in Hong Kong, in anticipation of the war, Dewey requested troop reinforcements from Washington. With the declaration of war, he and his fleet steamed to Manila and on May 1, annihilated an aging Spanish fleet, with only one loss of life: an American sailor felled by heat stroke. The lopsided victory essentially sealed the fate of Spanish rule. It was an outcome easily predicted: the Spanish empire was on its last legs, plagued by a significant trade deficit and political in stability at home. American consular authorities had already contacted Aguinaldo in Singapore and led him to believe that the North American nation was coming to the revolution’s assistance and would engage the Spanish on behalf of what was hoped would soon be an in dependent country. Nothing was ever put in writing, however, leading to denials later on the part of the consular of ficials in volved. Aguinaldo followed shortly on May 19, brought back from Hong Kong to the islands by an American gunboat. Less than a week later, on May 24, 1898, he declared the establishment of a dictatorial government. It was to last until a Constitutional Assembly could be for med, a preliminary step in for ming a republic, with a president and a cabinet. At first, cordiality characterized relations between Aguinaldo and his Philippine revolutionary for ces and Dewey and his troops. A month after he arrived, on June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed from his home province of Cavite an in dependent Philippine republic. By then, Filipinos had defeated the Spanish in most of the archipelago and had ringed the Walled City—the king piece still in the hands of the Spanish but perilously close to being checkmated by Aguinaldo. Thus the stage was set for the subsequent and in evitable war between a fledgling nation—the first in Asia to raise the banner of revolution against a Western power—and a North American republic, itself founded on revolution and with a constitution that had served as a model and in spiration to others around the globe as well as to the Filipinos, its troops now set to deprive those same Filipinos of their right to freedom. In setting its sights on Spanish colonies in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the United States made it clear to the European powers that it would not be excluded in claiming its share of colonies so as to acquire markets and sources of raw materials. Overseas expansion was viewed by both U. S. politicians and entrepreneurs as a way out of the economic crisis that befell the U. S. in 1893. But taking over the for mer Spanish colony in Southeast Asia was not a for egone conclusion. France, Germany, England, and Japan showed proprietary as well as predatory in terest in the islands, having sent warships to Manila Bay, to the great annoyance of Commodore Dewey. However, the war that erupted in early 1899 between the United States and the fledgling Republic of the Philippines, and the in crease in U. S. troops, effectively curtailed for eign in terest, at least until the outbreak of World War II. The entry of the United States obviously complicated the picture, however. On one level, Spanish colonialism was being confronted by American imperialism, eager to administer the coup de grace to the old or der. On another level, the Philippine Revolution was once more under the leadership of Aguinaldo and his fellow principalia—a revolution that had only grown stronger and had the Spanish on the ropes. In an at tempt to delay the in evitable, the Spanish proposed the for mation of a consultative assembly to be made up of the elite, and to bestow on Aguinaldo the rank of brigadier general if he would join the Spanish army. Both of fers were refused. On the ground, Aguinaldo and his army consolidated their gains, capturing Spanish garrisons in quick succession and, by the beginning of July 1898, controlled virtually the entire colony, except for the capital, Manila, to which it laid siege, alongside, albeit uneasily, U. S. troops. In these early stages, the Filipinos were not averse to American protection, regardless of whether the rank and file viewed the North Americans as genuinely sympathetic with their goals as set out by the Katipunan. In the meantime, the United States for ces played for time until more troops arrived. By late July, twelve thousand troops were on hand, and the reafter more troops began to arrive regularly. Aguinaldo declared the in dependence of the Philippines on June 12— Commodore Dewey was in vited to the momentous occasion but he begged off, saying it was mail day—and for the first time, the Philippine flag was displayed and the national anthem sung"

Aguinaldo declared the in dependence of the Philippines on June 12— Commodore Dewey was in vited to the momentous occasion but he begged off, saying it was mail day—and for the first time, the Philippine flag was displayed and the national anthem sung. In a nod to the United States, still seen as an omnipotent ally, the declaration stated: “Under the protection of the mighty and humane North American Nation, we proclaim and solemnly declare, in the name and by authority of the in habitants of all these Philippine Islands, that they are and have the right to be free and in dependent; that they are released from all obedience to the crown of Spain; that every political tie between the two is and must be completely severed and annulled; and that, like all free and in dependent states, they have complete authority to make war, conclude peace, establish treaties of commerce, enter into alliance, regulate commerce, and execute all other acts and things that in dependent states have the right to do.” Aguinaldo then began appointing his first cabinet ministers, in preparation for the business of governing a full-blown republic. In these for mative months, Apolinario Mabini, a brilliant thirty-four-year-old lawyer of peasant or igins from the southern Tagalog province of Batangas, became Aguinaldo’s political adviser. Dubbed the Sublime Paralytic due to paralysis of the lower limbs, Mabini was carted by relays of men to Cavite. It wasn’t long before he was seen as the brains of the revolution, for his ability to navigate the complex fields of diplomacy and help create a government to suit the temper of the times. He drafted decrees for Aguinaldo and persuaded the latter to move from a dictatorship to a revolutionary government. By June 23, 1898, such an administration was for med, with Aguinaldo as president. Local governments were established, keeping in place the administrative structures set up by the Spanish. Mabini was a Freemason and a member of Rizal’s La Liga Filipina. Initially opposed to armed struggle, he believed in the advocacy of reforms and had been a correspondent for Marcelo H. del Pilar’s La Solidaridad in Barcelona, enabling its expatriate readers and the Spanish to know what was going on in Manila. He quickly realized that Spain, having resisted in stituting reforms agreed to under the Biak-na-Bato Treaty, would never acquiesce to handing over power; revolution was the only recourse. Envious of his closeness to Aguinaldo, and probably out of snobbery, other members of Aguinaldo’s cabinet spread the canard that Mabini’s paralysis was due to his having contracted syphilis, in an at tempt to besmirch his character. The Aguinaldo government disseminated in for mation about the emergent state through two publications: El Heraldo de la Revolucíon— later to be called Gaceta de Filipinas —and La Independencia, whose founder and editor was General Antonio Luna. These served as outlets for exhortatory articles and of ficial communiqués, as well as news articles; more importantly, the two papers presented a portrait of a legitimate, functioning government. Even though American for ces had been beefed up, Filipino troops controlled the major approaches to Intramuros and could have easily for ced its defenders to surrender by cutting off food and water supplies, but they held back. The Spanish, to whom surrendering to a people they had viewed for 333 years as in ferior and in capable of self-rule would have been an unbearable humiliation, cut a deal with the Americans. By early August General Fermin Jaudenes, in command of Intramuros’s defense, was in backroom negotiations with Dewey to arrange a mock battle for the Walled City in which the newcomers would win but in a way that saved face for the Spanish. After a sham battle on August 13, 1898, to preserve their honor, the Spanish garrison defending Intramuros yielded to the Westerners. The scripted battle went off as planned, though not with out six American and forty-nine Spanish casualties. The Yankees claimed Manila that same day and refused entry to Philippine troops, on the grounds that the Spanish were fearful of being killed en masse by vengeful Filipino soldiers. The actions of the U. S. military confirmed the worst fears of the Aguinaldo government: that the United States was out to claim the colony for itself. Now with Manila in the hands of the U. S., and Spain surrendering to the North Americans, erstwhile allies faced each other in an uneasy standoff. Seeking to nullify U. S. gains, Aguinaldo sought diplomatic recognition from for eign governments; it dispatched Felipé Agoncillo as its representative, first, to Washington, D. C., and then to Paris, where Spain and the United States met in October 1898 for a conference to for mally end the Spanish-American War, and to determine the conditions under which the victor would receive the spoils. Protesting that there was already in place a legitimate government, Agoncillo was ignored, and refused a place at the bargaining table. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was for mally signed, setting out these terms: Spain would relinquish Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas (Guam). In return, the United States would in demnify Spain $20 million—or a little less than $3 per Filipino, the population of the archipelago then estimated at 7 million. The treaty also allowed the Spanish ten-year access to Philippine ports and goods for the purposes of trade. For the treaty to take effect, the United States Congress needed to ratify it, and its approval was by no means sure. A vote was scheduled for February 6, 1899.

The treaty also allowed the Spanish ten-year access to Philippine ports and goods for the purposes of trade. For the treaty to take effect, the United States Congress needed to ratify it, and its approval was by no means sure. A vote was scheduled for February 6, 1899. Spain agreed to hand over control of Las Islas Filipinas, as well as Guam and Puerto Rico, to the United States. The U. S. allowed Cuba its in dependence, but burdened it with the Platt Amendment, which provided that Cuba cede territory to the United States for use as military bases—Guantánamo, principally—and the right to in tervene in Cuba to preserve life, property, and liberty, essentially whenever Washington deemed such in tervention necessary. The amendment also barred Cuba from making a treaty with another nation, giving the U. S. effective control over its for eign affairs. Signed into law by President Mc Kinley in 1901, these provisions were in corporated into the Cuban Constitution, rendering the island nation a U. S. protectorate and guaranteeing U. S. imperial hegemony by in direct, rather than direct, means. (These provisions would later be repealed by the Cubans in 1934.) A Lull on the Battlefield Determined to assert control, in September of 1898 Aguinaldo had moved the provisional government to Malolos, Bulacan, a province bordering Manila to the north. There he convened a congress—the consultative body Mabini had proposed—at the hoary Barasoain Church. There trooped eight-five representatives (mostly men of property) from provinces controlled by the Aguinaldo government. They set about drafting a Constitution, though this was essentially entrusted to one delegate, Felipé Calderón. Drawing from the constitutions of several South American countries as well as that of the United States, Calderón wrote a draft that proposed a unicameral legislature, and made the National Assembly, essentially the legislature, the dominant branch of government. The rationale, with which most of the Congress agreed, was that the Spanish colonial regime had been marked by an overbearing and tyrannical chief executive, the Governor General. It was hoped that the elevation of the National Assembly as preeminent branch, to be made up of elected representatives, would avoid this pitfall. Mabini opposed the adoption of a constitution. To him, the Malolos Congress was an in terim body, its raison d’etre to act as a consultant and propose policies to Aguinaldo’s revolutionary government, especially with regard to possible war with the United States, whom Mabini had from the outset mistrusted. Once a permanent government had come into being, a true constitution could be drawn up. How the Congress would act was determined in part by class. Mabini came from a peasant background, while Calderón and most others of the Congress were of the elite ilustrado class. Pressed on which course to take, Aguinaldo, himself a property owner and member of the principalia, decided to abide by the wishes of the Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Calderón-drafted Constitution. Most of its or iginal provisions were endorsed, except for one: an article that made Catholicism the of ficial religion of the state. In effect, this proposed article would retain what the Spanish had wrought—a devoutly Catholic state. This didn’t sit well with those in the Congress who harbored strong anti-clerical sentiments and many of whom certainly would have been Masons. After debates on the pros and cons of the provision, the Congress affirmed by only one vote the principle of separation of church and state. Written in Spanish, the document was adopted and the Philippine Republic in augurated on January 23, 1899. The Constitution acknowledged that sovereignty resided exclusively with the Filipino people. To Aguinaldo, the Malolos Constitution was “the most glorious expression of the noble aspirations of the Filipino people, a mirror of their culture, and a clear proof before the world of their capacity to govern the mselves.” Aside from the separation of church and state, its other notable provisions were setting up a system of free and compulsory education; a new fiscal and tax system; the foundation of a navy; a reorganized army; and the establishment of a diplomatic corps. Elected or not, the Malolos delegates were eager to show that they were capable of running the country with out outside help. By then, most of the Spanish for ces had sailed for Spain, except for a fifty- man garrison in the small town of Baler, in the province of Tayabas on the largely in accessible Pacific coast of northeastern Luzon. There for eleven months, from July 1, 1898 to June 2, 1899, the garrison held out in the town church—the only stone building in Baler—refusing to believe the revolution had succeeded, even when Spanish of ficials visited them. Finally, an article in a Madrid newspaper artfully left behind convinced the commanding of ficer of the truth, and the longest encounter between the Filipino for ces and the Spanish was over. The thirty survivors surrendered and were treated with respect by the Filipino troops. Back in Barcelona, the soldiers were given a hero’s welcome. (This event was the basis of a 1945 Spanish film, Los Ultimos de Filipinas, or The Last of the Philippines, a nostalgic valorization of patriotic duty and the defense of empire, very much in tune with the values of the Franco regime, already in place since 1939.) Being that Spanish colonial rule had spanned more than three centuries, there remained sizable communities of Spanish families who had lived not just in Manila and its environs but in port cities such as Cebu and Iloilo for generations, had in termarried with the natives, and considered Las Islas Filipinas their home, albeit now to be ruled by English speakers.

Such businesses as they had set up— San Miguel Brewery and Tabacalera being two of the more enduring examples— continued to operate. And of course those centuries guaranteed an imprint of Hispanicization and a mestizo culture that had evolved and proved to be in eradicable, especially when it came to matters of faith. The United States and Spain agreed that Filipinos would be given religious freedom as well as civil rights but conditioned on approval of the U. S. Congress. President Mc Kinley appointed a commission, to be headed by Cornell University president Jacob G. Schurman, to proceed to the newly acquired colony and in vestigate conditions there. By the time the Schurman Commission arrived in Manila in March of 1899, however, the anticipated war between the United States and a newly minted Republic of the Philippines had been going on for a month. A S PLENDID L ITTLE W AR T URNS U GLY: T HE 1899 P HILIPPINE -A MERICAN W AR The deliberations and decisions of the Malolos Congress were ignored by the U. S. Less than two weeks after the in auguration of the Philippine Republic, and two days before the U. S. Congress was to vote on ratifying the Treaty of Paris and the takeover of the Philippines, hostilities between the fledgling government and the United States erupted. On February 4, 1899, two American soldiers, Willy Grayson and Orville Miller of the Nebraska Volunteers, shot and killed two Filipino soldiers. Grayson later said the Filipinos disregarded his warnings to halt and identify the mselves when they apparently wandered too close to American lines. After the two in fantrymen had killed them, Grayson shouted to his comrades-in-arms, “Line up, fellas. The niggers are in here all through these yards!” With the war conveniently being blamed on the Filipino for ces, and public war fever being stoked once more, the Treaty of Paris was ratified by the Senate, but by only one vote. The 1899 Philippine-American War (described by the United States government as a mere “in surrection”) was fierce, bloody, and long- drawn out, of ficially ending in 1902 but in fact continuing for a decade more. It far surpassed in ferocity, cost, and duration the Spanish-American War, which lasted all of four months, though it is this war that is remembered while its more costly 1899 sequel is not. With the U. S. military moving beyond Manila to conquer and colonize the rest of the country, the Philippine revolutionary army resisted fiercely but, lacking the weaponry, was outgunned. Only half of the estimated 80,000 Filipino soldiers had rifles, with the other half relying on bolos (machetes), spears, and homemade guns. Unopposed, Dewey cruised the Pasig River, lobbing 500- pound shells into Filipino for tifications, with predictable and deadly results. In conventional combat, not surprisingly, the Filipinos suffered disproportionate losses. The next day, February 5, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation in which he stated: “I know that war has always produced great losses; I know that the Philippine people have not yet recovered from past losses and are not in the condition to endure others. But I also know by experience how bitter is slavery, and by experience I know that we should sacrifice all on the altar of our honor and of the national in tegrity so unjustly at tacked.” More disheartening to those committed to the revolution were the ilustrado defections to the enemy in May, at tracted by of fers from the Schurman Commission for positions in the government being cobbled to gether. Cayetano Arellano, for in stance, was appointed to the Supreme Court in Manila. Another noteworthy defection was that of Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, a member of the ilustrado expatriate community in Europe, who founded La Democracia, a decidedly pro-American paper. Later on, de Tavera, along with other wealthy ilustrados who had supported the revolution against Spain, helped establish the Federalista Party, which in itially sought only statehood but changed that to gradual in dependence when the or iginal stance failed to at tract any significant public following. Such defections were not altogether surprising, as the ilustrados as a whole had always been reformists rather than revolutionaries; the United States, it seemed to them, would grant the reforms they had long and vainly sought from Spain. In April of 1900, the second Philippine Commission arrived, headed by William H. Taft, to put into place the Schurman Commission recommendations. Taking on legislative powers, the Taft Commission for mally set up colonial rule. Taft—a massive six-footer who weighed 340 pounds—persuaded de Tavera, and two other ilustrados, José Luzuriaga and Benito Legarda, Sr., to sit on the Commission, a seductive signal to the landed elite that they could have a hand in ruling the colony. The next year, Taft was named by President Mc Kinley as the first governor general of the islands, along with several Americans to serve in his cabinet. All this went on even as the war raged outside the few pacified areas. Racism accentuated the cruel and brutal character of the U. S. war of conquest, marked by the use of to rture, the killing of prisoners, and genocidal tendencies. The Spanish colonizers had been booted out, but not in opposition to their beliefs or practices. The U. S. for ces were contemptuous of Filipinos and described them as “barbarians” and “savages,” reflecting the prejudices and xenophobia of the larger American society, one that routinely portrayed Chinese and Japanese immigrants as a “Yellow Peril.” The U. S. soldiers fashioned an epithet just for the Filipino: “Gugu”—from gago, the Tagalog word for “stupid”—which more than half a century later would morph into “gook” to accommodate the Koreans and the Vietnamese"

Soldiers on the march of ten sang these lyrics: Damn, damn the Filipino Pockmarked Khakiac ladrone [thief]! Underneath the starry flag Civilize him with a Krag And return us to our beloved home! Many of the U. S. of ficers were veterans of the genocidal campaigns against Native American nations, and in the Filipino enemy they discerned unmistakable likenesses. And so did Roosevelt: on the campaign trail for the vice-presidency of the United States, he likened the rebels to the Apaches and the Comanches. African-Americans serving in the U. S. expeditionary for ces were caught in a bind. On one hand, these Buffalo Soldiers—so-called for their bravery during U. S. wars against Native Americans—felt that they needed to show they were just as patriotic and courageous as the white soldiers. On the other hand, racial and social affinities between them and Filipinos were too obvious to be ignored, a fact brought home when white soldiers of ten called Filipinos “niggers.” Similar debates took place in African-American communities back in the United States. In Boston, black anti-imperialists adopted resolutions opposing the war. One such resolution declared: “Resolved, that while the rights of colored citizens in the South, sacredly guaranteed them by the amendment of the Constitution, are shamefully disregarded; and while the frequent lynching of Negroes who are denied a civilized trial are a reproach to the Republican government, the duty of the president and the country is to reform these crying domestic wrongs and not to at tempt the civilization of alien peoples by powder and shot.” Many black soldiers defected, the most celebrated (or in famous, depending on one’s perspective) being David Fagan. The twenty-four-year-old Fagan became an of ficer under the command of General José Alejandrino in Central Luzon. For two years, he proved to be a thorn in the side of his fellow Americans, so much so that his exploits became legendary, with an article in the New York Times characterizing him as a “cunning and highly skilled guerrilla of ficer who harassed and evaded large conventional American units.” The U. S. military of fered $600 for his capture, dead or alive. On December 5, 1901, a Tagalog hunter of fered U. S. of ficers the severed head of someone he claimed was Fagan. The identity was never confirmed, nor was there a record of reward money being paid. Fagan’s fate to this day remains shrouded in mystery. At a military disadvantage when confronting the U. S. military in open battle, the Philippine revolutionaries ceded ground, and Aguinaldo and his staff resorted to guerrilla warfare. The switch prompted the U. S. military to label this “uncivilized”—a charge refuted by Mabini, who pointed out that the Filipinos had no choice since they were poorly armed, that they had to continue to resist since their freedom was being threatened, and that “humiliating peace is to lerated only in uncivilized countries.” The war might have progressed differently if General Antonio Luna, Aguinaldo’s most capable field commander, had not been assassinated by Filipino soldiers in June of 1899. Luna was a wealthy ilustrado, and brother to the famous painter Juan Luna. Though Antonio had stayed on the sidelines in the 1898 revolution, shortly before the war broke out between the Philippines and the United States, he of fered his services to Aguinaldo and proved his mettle as a brave and savvy of ficer. He was soon heading Central Luzon military operations—the main the ater at this point in the war. However, Luna, notorious for his volatile temper and tart to ngue, in curred the wrath of several in fluential military of ficers. Even the normally unflappable Mabini complained of Luna’s mercurial disposition but knew that in this general he had an important ilustrado ally against accepting any compromise with the Americans, one who moreover declared impassionedly, whenever the occasion presented itself, his devotion to the goal of in dependence. Luna said that everywhere he went he asked the people if they wanted autonomy. According to him, their steadfast answer was: “Long live in dependence. May autonomy die!” On June 5, Luna—already falsely rumored to be contemplating a coup against the Supremo—rode to Cabanatuan, in the Central Luzon province of Nueva Ecija, in response to a note alleged to have been written by Aguinaldo in viting him to meet and discuss strategy. When Luna arrived, Aguinaldo was nowhere to be seen; Luna was stabbed and shot by soldiers from Aguinaldo’s hometown of Kawit—the same soldiers Luna had once vehemently upbraided for some breach of protocol and which censure still rankled. He was buried with full military honors, but his killers were never brought to justice. The War of Words In the meantime, the propaganda war was in full swing. The Schurman Commission stressed that the U. S. was on a mission civilatrice, to render the Filipinos “among the most civilized peoples of the world.” But setting aside its stated altruistic aims, U. S. in tentions to wards the Philippines were remarkably similar to Spain’s: to exploit the Philippines as a market and source of raw materials, and to utilize the islands as a steppingstone from which to gain access to the markets of China. The new imperialists were, however, not so unvarnished in their stated reasons for holding on to the Southeast Asian archipelago.

They pictured the mselves as reluctant colonizers impelled more by a Christian sense of duty than the desire for material gain. Conquest may have been painful, but was essential were the country to move for ward. President Mc Kinley’s famous peroration to a group of Protestant clergymen puts it rather melodramatically: When I next realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps I confess I did not know what to do with them…. I walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight; and I’m not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed the Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way—I don’t know how it was, but it came: … that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died. And then I went to bed, and went to sleep, and slept soundly, and the next morning I sent for the chief engineer of the War Department (our map maker), and I told him to put the Philippines on the map of the United States, and there they are, and there they will stay while I am president! Mc Kinley conveniently overlooked the fact that the islands had been Catholic for more than three hundred years. The need to “uplift and civilize” the Filipinos would be the theme in cessantly harped on every time U. S. imperialism was questioned. While self-serving, such justification was closely linked to the unshakeable belief in racial superiority that permeated the U. S. war effort—one that Rudyard Kipling endorsed. Kipling wrote his poem “White Man’s Burden” precisely to encourage the United States in its colonial endeavor (the poem’s subtitle is “The United States and the Philippines”): Take up the White Man’s Burden Send forth the best ye breed Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives’ needs To wait in heavy harness On fluttered folk and wild Your new-caught sullen peoples Half-devil and half-child … As the Americans envisioned it, colonial rule would be tutelary in in tent and benign in execution. Washington, after all, sought only “to spread peace and happiness … freedom … and self-government.” At a speech in Boston, Senator Alfred Beveridge had declared that the United States was “a conquering race…. we must obey our blood and occupy new markets and, if necessary, new lands.” Once the Spanish were vanquished, and the prospect of war with the Aguinaldo regime seemed imminent, the same senator thundered in Indianapolis, in response to the rhetorical question of ruling a people with out their consent: “Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, humane, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them?” In May, two months after it began its in vestigations, with most of its in for mation derived from a small number of the conservative elite, in cluding for mer members of the Malolos Congress eager for rapprochement with the United States, the commission recommended the appointment of a governor general who, like his Spanish predecessors, would be the paramount ruler. There would be an advisory group and an in dependent judiciary. Most importantly, the commission not surprisingly ratified the view that Filipinos were unfit for self- government, that the country was simply a “collection of tribes,” and that the refore it was imperative for Americans to stay on and impart the lessons of democracy. Enough members of the Malolos Congress favored accepting the Schurman of fer, which would have rendered the islands an American protectorate. They requested Aguinaldo to dissolve the Mabini Cabinet and form a new one that could secure a peaceful arrangement with the American for ces and the government they had been setting up. Instead, Mabini proposed an armistice that General Otis rejected, believing that the “in surrection” would collapse easily. Mabini then issued a statement urging the people to continue the struggle. Mabini was eventually captured by the Americans in late December of 1899. Refusing to pledge allegiance to the United States, he was exiled to the Marianas. His fragile health worsening in the unfamiliar setting, he finally agreed to take the oath of allegiance to the United States in early 1903, and thus was allowed to return to the Philippines, where he died in May. Negotiations on autonomy broke down, and the war continued. In the meantime, the Aguinaldo government kept an eye out for political developments in the U. S. that might mean favorable concessions for the Philippines. The November presidential elections of 1900 between Mc Kinley and William Jennings Bryan were seen as an opportunity for the anti-imperialist for ces in the U. S. to win, but Bryan was defeated. The war was still going badly for the Filipinos, for cing Aguinaldo and his staff to keep moving north, to the mountainous terrain of the Cordilleras. By November 1899, he and his army focused on defensive tactics. The Supremo was nearly caught at the mountain pass of Tirad, in Ilocos Sur, but General Gregorio del Pilar, commander of Aguinaldo’s rear guard of sixty riflemen, delayed the 900 American troops at the cost of his own life, enabling Aguinaldo to escape. Dead at the age of twenty-four, his body left to lie on the rocky soil, stripped of most of his clothing and decorations by the victorious soldiers, del Pilar was the nephew of the Propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar and the youngest general in Aguinaldo’s army, earning him the sobriquet of the Boy General.

Aguinaldo and his men finally found refuge in the mountain stronghold of Palanan, Isabela Province, on the remote rocky northeastern coast of Luzon. At the outset, General Elwood Otis assured Washington that the war would be over in a few weeks, especially after his for ces had taken Malolos, yet he kept requesting more troops as the weeks turned into months. Gaining ground was easy enough, but it didn’t take long for the U. S. command to realize they were in danger of stretching their for ces too thinly as they struck deeper into the countryside, where it proved harder to defend the mselves against guerrilla at tacks. Instead of set engagements, the Filipino guerrillas could choose the time and place for ambushes and didn’t require the logistical support the Yankee soldiers did, for the simple reason that the Filipinos could and did rely on the local population for their supplies as well as hide among them in plain sight. Too, the locals resisted providing in for mation that would have aided the in vaders. The Aguinaldo government had the support of the masses, overwhelmingly based outside the few urban areas and who, having borne the brunt of Spanish abuse, were not about to yield meekly to strangers who looked and behaved like their Spanish predecessors. T HE C ONDUCT OF THE W AR Early on, a General Shafter proved to be prescient regarding the way war had to be waged: “It may be necessary to kill half of the Filipinos in or der that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords.” The U. S. for ces grew in creasingly frustrated as they proved unable to in filtrate guerrilla networks and disrupt the workings of shadow governments. In to wns and villages, the Filipinos practiced what came to be derisively referred to by U. S. soldiers as “amigo warfare”— friend by day, foe by night. In areas that were considered “pacified”—under U. S. military control, and with a local government sympathetic or at least seemingly cooperative with the U. S.—the residents never outwardly resisted and of ten seemed to abet occupation but in reality constantly sought to undermine that same occupation, either by being actively in volved as guerrillas, or providing the guerrillas shelter and support, a majority of whom after all were friends and relatives. Such frustration on the part of the in vader, combined with a racist outlook on Filipinos—“half-devil, half-child”—provided the rationale for in discriminate warfare and to rture. In spite of press censorship, reports filtered back to the United States that detailed wartime at rocities, such as the burning of villages; the in discriminate killing of civilians; the execution of prisoners where a take-no-prisoner policy was in place; and the use of to rture. In an article for Harper’s Weekly, a correspondent by the name of John Bass described the in competence of Otis, the military tactics used as unsuitable to the tropical climate, and the obvious sympathy the locals had for the in surgents. He candidly observed that the “the sooner the people of the United States find out that the peoples of the Philippines do not wish to be governed by us, the better.” One major source of unfiltered in for mation were the letters soldiers wrote home to their families, recounting their horrific experiences. These graphic details would of ten land in the pages of hometown newspapers. From Anthony Michea, of the Third Artillery: “We bombarded a place called Malabon [a suburb of Manila], and then we went in and killed every native we met, men, women, and children.” And Charles R. Wyland, of Company C, Washington Volunteers, observed: “I have seen a shell from our artillery strike a bunch of Filipinos, and then they would go scattering through the air, legs, arms, heads, all disconnected. And such sights actually make our boys laugh and yell, ‘That shot was a peach.’” Two methods of dealing with amigo warfare were particularly harsh. The more sweeping one was the policy of hamletting, practiced by the Spanish in Cuba and known as reconcentrado, a technique that would be repeated during the Vietnam War more than half a century later. In early 1901, for example, the U. S. military herded the entire population of one island, Marinduque, into five concentration camps. But the most brutal example was perhaps the pacification of the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, and Tayabas (now Quezon) as directed by Major General Franklin Bell, who had earlier in troduced the residents of the Ilocos region to the benefits of reconcentration. Bell was determined to hunt down the hold-out General Malvar, who commanded five thousand guerrillas and effectively controlled local governments. In early December 1901, Bell had the population for cibly evacuated into designated centers or to wns that were transformed into virtual prison camps. The Filipinos were or dered to move into specified zones and to bring whatever they could of their property. Anything left behind would be subject to confiscation or destruction. This meant that the outlying villages and their adjacent farm fields were abandoned, the idea being to deprive the guerrillas civilian cover while at the same time keeping a close watch on the quarantined villagers who the mselves could be rebels. Locals had to demonstrate that they were “active” friends, e. g., providing in for mation to Bell’s for ces as to the whereabouts of the guerrillas. Curfews were put in place and boundaries set up outside each camp, with a no-man’s land beyond that—one that was termed morbidly a “zone of death,” for anyone caught in it after curfew was likely to get shot, no questions asked"

In this manner, the region was turned upside down and laid waste to, as abandoned villages were of ten put to the to rch—particularly if these were suspected of having harbored guerrillas—wells poisoned, and livestock either starved or killed. Ninety percent of the region’s carabaos, or water buffalos, perished, and rice production plummeted to just a fourth of its pre-reconcentrado levels. Unable to at tend to their fields, the huddled population suffered an in or dinate rate of death due to malnutrition and disease, such as dengue fever and malaria. In Batangas alone, 54,000 civilians died by the end of 1901. Overall, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people perished due to Bell’s iron- fisted rule. In April 1902, General Malvar surrendered to the U. S. for ces, his capitulation taken as a conclusive sign that the fighting was over, and that the remaining resisters were simply bandits and thieves, taking advantage of the war to practice their ancient trade under the guise of nationalism. On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the war, or “in surrection,” over. It wasn’t, of course. Enough revolutionary leaders continued the war of resistance, such as Generals Sakay, Ola, and Bulan. Similar tactics were exercised in the Visayan island of Samar. One town in particular provoked a scorched-earth policy from the commanding of ficer for the region, General Jacob Smith. Balangiga was a coastal town in the southern part of the island, where seventy-four U. S. troops were garrisoned. The troops routinely abused the to wnspeople, of ten for cing them into open-air holding pens even in rainy weather. This prompted clandestine plans for retaliation. On the morning of September 28, 1901, as the men were sitting down to breakfast, Filipino guerrillas, some of them disguised as women, burst into the mess hall and, armed mainly with bolos, at tacked. Both commanding of ficers were boloed to death, forty-six more were killed, and twenty-two seriously wounded. Only four escaped. Retaliation was swift and brutal. General Smith declared his in tention to turn the province into a “howling wilderness,” telling his men, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the more you will please me.” According to his in structions, anyone over ten was fair game. A food and trade blockade was in stituted, villages were burned, noncombatants were shot, and, as with General Bell’s policy, Filipinos had to actively show that they were friends; one surefire way of doing so was by turning in for mer. In 1902, General Smith was court-martialed and found guiltly. His punishment? An admonition and for ced retirement. * Just as brutal a retaliation visited on the in digenous population elsewhere was the 1906 massacre of 600 Moros—men, women, and children—at Bud Dajo, a dormant volcano on the island of Jolo off the southern coast of Mindanao. The in discriminate slaughter, presided over by General Leonard Wood, was a response to the killing of several U. S. soldiers a few days earlier. In Mindanao, in a six-month period, Moros had launched various assaults on American emplacements. Two hundred smaller engagements alone had also taken place in 1901. The war against the Moros was different since it had echoes of the religious Crusades against the Muslims in the Holy Land, whereas elsewhere in the archipelago the war was a secular affair, being against Filipinos who were the mselves fellow Christians, though the conduct of the war was decidedly un- Christian. One favored method of to rture, practiced on prisoners who were considered to be potential high-value in for mants, was the so-called “water-cure.” In this harsh method of in terrogation, the detainee was for ced to imbibe huge amounts of water, with soldiers pinioning his limbs, for cing open his mouth, and pouring water through a funnel. Sometimes water was for ced down a prisoner’s nostrils. Once the detainee was primed, he would be pummeled or kicked, the liquid being for cibly and painfully ejected. Though reluctant to give antiwar critics any ammunition, Governor Taft candidly stated before the U. S. Senate in 1902 that “there had been … in dividual in stances of water cure, that to rture that I believe in volves pouring water down the throat so that the man swells and gets the impression that he is going to be suffocated and then he tells what he knows.” Former Sergeant Leroy Hallock, who had witnessed the “cure” administered to at least a dozen in surgents, was more graphic: “They would swell up—their stomachs would swell up pretty large—and I have seen blood come from their mouth [sic] after they had been given a good deal of it.” This same Hallock testified to seeing one village of three to four thousand in habitants being to rched, and of knowing of at least half a dozen other such burnings. When the U. S. military was accused of perpetrating at rocities, a blanket denial was issued, or they were explained away by saying the harsh methods were justified on the grounds that these were necessary against a people who were less than human, and to whom the refore the common standards of humanity, or civilization, could not be applied. (It would be an argument repeated during the Korean and Vietnam wars.) In the case of General Smith, he was court-martialed and found guilty of in citing his troops to cruelties. He was punished with an admonition. An American congressman, who visited the Philippines and who preferred to remain anonymous, spoke frankly about the results of the pacification campaign"

He was punished with an admonition. An American congressman, who visited the Philippines and who preferred to remain anonymous, spoke frankly about the results of the pacification campaign. “You never hear of any disturbances in Northern Luzon, because there isn’t anybody there to rebel…. Our soldiers took no prisoners, they kept no records; they simply swept the country and wherever and whenever they could get hold of a Filipino they killed.” General Elwood Otis proved to be in ept and was replaced by General Arthur Mc Arthur, who took over in May of 1900 and served until July 1, 1901. Mac Arthur was a veteran of the wars against Native Americans. Though he endorsed imperialist goals, he was a realist who knew that the Filipinos had no love for the Americans. He once said that it would take “ten years of bayonet treatment” to pacify the country. He realized that successful guerrilla warfare “depends upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population. That such unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of discussion; how it is brought about and maintained is not so plain. Intimidation has undoubtedly accomplished much to this end; but fear as the only motive is hardly sufficient to account for the united and apparently spontaneous action of several millions of people.” The war could have dragged on longer but luck helped shorten it when a certain Cecilio Segismundo, a courier from Aguinaldo, was captured by U. S. for ces. Segismundo was carrying dispatches to commanders in the field, one of which asked for more men for Aguinaldo’s mountain hideout. Under in terrogation Segismundo revealed the whereabouts of the revolutionary leader. A plan was for mulated to gain entry to his Palanan redoubt with out arousing suspicion. Five U. S. soldiers, headed by General Frederick Funston, would pretend to be prisoners of the Macabebes, mercenaries from Pampanga Province, disguised as Filipino troop reinforcements. Accompanying them were some Tagalog turncoats and a Spanish secret service agent, Lazaro Segovia. Forged documents purporting to be from one of Aguinaldo’s generals completed their disguise. Departing Manila by boat on February 6, they were brought to the desolate Pacific coast of northeastern Luzon and the nce trekked through rainforests and mountain passes until on March 23, 1901, they gained entry into the camp. Brought before the unsuspecting Aguinaldo, Funston and his men were able to capture the Supremo and his staff. Barely a week after, on April 1,1901, Aguinaldo pledged allegiance at Malacañang, where he had been detained, to the United States. Mac Arthur resigned that same day, with Major General Adna Romanza Chaffee, also a veteran of the wars against Native Americans, taking over. On April 19, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation for peace, which said in part: “The Philippines decidedly wishes peace: be it so. Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation…. I proclaim before all the world that I cannot remain deaf to the voice of a people yearning for peace nor to the lamentations of thousands of families who long for freedom of their loved ones, which is promised them through the magnanimity of the great American nation.” Although the head of the Philippine Republic did desire a free and in dependent country, he had in itially been too trustful of the United States, and ignored signs until it was too late that the North Americans in tended to stay. In the end, like most of the ilustrados, Aguinaldo sought compromise even as he and his men bore arms. Despite Aguinaldo’s pronouncement, the war of resistance continued. As a counterinsurgency tactic, the reconcentrado method was used mercilessly. In southern Luzon, Bell’s reconcentrado bore fruit: a weakened General Malvar, along with his men, surrendered in April of 1902. With Aguinaldo quiescent and Malvar captured, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the war over on July 4, 1902. Henceforth, revolutionary fighters would be classified as bandits and thieves. On June 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission passed the Reconcentration Camp Act, rendering of ficial what the military had been utilizing in the field. The Act authorized any provincial governor to reconcentrate in the to wns all residents of outlying barrios if “ladrones” or “outlaws” operated in these areas, the reby hoping to dry the rivers in which the guerrilla fish swam. Another prize catch for the U. S. for ces was General Macario Sakay. Sakay grew up in Tondo, where he had gotten to know Bonifacio. Joining the Katipunan in 1894, Sakay acted in popular Tagalog verse dramas, which were staged in different neighborhoods in Manila, thus providing the perfect cover for the young Katipunero to move about. Countering U. S. efforts to brand Filipino fighters as brigands, General Sakay, based in the mountains of the southern Tagalog region, declared himself president of the Philippines in 1903 and decreed that “anybody who contributes or gives aid and comfort to the government of the United States of America will be considered a traitor to this native land.” Continuing operations by U. S. troops for ced him to move and eventually he agreed to yield. Through an in termediary, Sakay’s conditions for his surrender—among them, general amnesty and permission to carry firearms—were accepted by the authorities. He and his followers came down from the mountains to Cavite on July 20, 1906—four years after the war was of ficially declared over—where they were in vited to a banquet at the governor’s residence. There, he and his followers were seized and disarmed, accused of crimes under the Brigandage Act and quickly brought to trial. Not surprisingly, he was found guilty, and he and an aide, Colonel Lucio de Vega, were in carcerated at Bilibid Prison in Manila, and hanged on Sept. 13, 1907. Before his death, the revolutionary general declared to the small crowd of witnesses (mostly prison guards and employees), “I want to tell you that we are not bandits and robbers, as the Americans have accused us, but members of the revolutionary force that defended our mother country the Philippines! Farewell! Long live the Republic and may our in dependence be born in the future! Farewell! Long live the Philippines!” In the Visayas, a notable case was that of the self-proclaimed Pope of Negros Island, who was a thorn in the side of the U. S. military"

Through an in termediary, Sakay’s conditions for his surrender—among them, general amnesty and permission to carry firearms—were accepted by the authorities. He and his followers came down from the mountains to Cavite on July 20, 1906—four years after the war was of ficially declared over—where they were in vited to a banquet at the governor’s residence. There, he and his followers were seized and disarmed, accused of crimes under the Brigandage Act and quickly brought to trial. Not surprisingly, he was found guilty, and he and an aide, Colonel Lucio de Vega, were in carcerated at Bilibid Prison in Manila, and hanged on Sept. 13, 1907. Before his death, the revolutionary general declared to the small crowd of witnesses (mostly prison guards and employees), “I want to tell you that we are not bandits and robbers, as the Americans have accused us, but members of the revolutionary force that defended our mother country the Philippines! Farewell! Long live the Republic and may our in dependence be born in the future! Farewell! Long live the Philippines!” In the Visayas, a notable case was that of the self-proclaimed Pope of Negros Island, who was a thorn in the side of the U. S. military. Papa Isio, as he was called, was a charismatic peasant who led a band of remontados, the Pulajanes (the Scarlet Ones), and had joined for ces with the local elite in opposing the Spanish in the 1898 Revolution. Once war erupted between the Aguinaldo government and the United States, however, the local principalia signaled the U. S. that the island would gladly be a protectorate—a deal that Papa Isio and his followers rejected. The Pulajanes resisted both U. S. occupation and landlord collaboration, burning the haciendas of pro-American hacenderos. Motivated by economic desperation, the ragtag army fought U. S. troops bravely but in 1907, Isio, realizing the futility of armed struggle, gave himself up and was duly sentenced to death. The religious trappings of Papa Isio and his Pulajanes reflected a desire lodged deep in the psyche of the people, for a more active role in determining both the spiritual and material for ces that would guide their lives. Hence, his refusal to go along with the principalia leadership. This discordance between a populist stance and an elitist accommodation in fact marked both the revolution against Spain and the war with the Americans, albeit episodically, e. g., Bonifacio versus Aguinaldo, Mabini versus the Malolos Congress. Even if in directly, both strains sprung from the 1872 martyrdom of Gomez, Burgos and Zamora and the drive to Filipinize Catholic parishes—an aim that had acted as a spur to revolution. Not surprisingly, native priests sympathized with the revolution, even though the mostly Spanish Church had condemned it. The Emergence of an Independent Church Filipino priests had no quarrel with Catholicism itself. How could they, when they were believers in a country that, after more than three centuries, was solidly Catholic. Their quarrel was with the racialization of their ranks; a schism was in evitable. A secular priest from the Ilocos region, Fr. Gregorio Aglipay, thirty- eight years old and the only man of the cloth at the Malolos Congress, served as Military Vicar for Aguinaldo’s for ces. He supported the goals of the revolution and asked Filipino priests to do the same. He reasoned that with colonial ties to Spain severed, the patronato real was no longer in effect. It was time for Filipino priests to take control of the church in the country. Aglipay’s archbishop, Bernardino Nozaleda—clearly acting more as a loyal Spaniard than a Catholic priest—excommunicated him in January of 1899 even though Aglipay had made clear his in tent to remain loyal to the Vatican. On October 23, 1899, Aglipay, with the implicit endorsement of Mabini, who wished to see the establishment of a Filipinized church, still heeding the Vatican but working closely with, rather than against, the Philippine government, or ganized an ecclesiastical assembly in the province of Tarlac, in Central Luzon. The result was a provisional constitution for a nationalist Catholic church wherein for eign bishops could work in the island only with the approval of Filipino priests—clearly aimed at the Spanish ecclesiastical authorities used to calling the shots in the colony. Subsequent events, especially the war with the United States (in which Aglipay fought as a general) led to the founding of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (the Philippine Independent Church) in 1902, with Aglipay as its supreme head. Almost two decades later, the church counted a million and a half members, known as Aglipayans. Instrumental in the for mation of the new church was Isabelo de los Reyes, who was from Vigan in the Ilocos region. A distant relative of Rizal, de los Reyes was an activist who had been jailed by both the Spanish and the United States colonial administrations. At the age of twenty-four, by then a practicing journalist, in 1889 he published El Ilocano, the first such publication devoted entirely to a Philippine language other than Tagalog. He went on to become a distinguished folklorist who envisioned a nation that encompassed both the un- Hispanicized in digenous and Christianized groups—a nation that transcended ethnicity. Married thrice, the man was as in defatigable in his campaign for in dependence as he was in siring of fspring: he had twenty-eight children.

The colony would serve as a huge economic stimulus package: its subjects would be a captive market for consumer goods turned out by an in dustrialized United States, with a capacity for production that demanded new markets. A countervailing force was the Anti-Imperialist League, founded in Boston on June 15, 1898. Its guiding principle was that no government was legitimate which did not have the free consent of the governed. The League spearheaded the anti-war movement, its public visibility owing mainly to its high-profile members, in cluding Mark Twain, the in dustrialist Andrew Carnegie, the president of Harvard University Charles Eliot, and Samuel Gompers, labor union leader and founder of the American Federation of Labor. In its platform the League stated: We earnestly condemn the policy of the present national administration in the Philippines. It seeks to extinguish the spirit of 1776 in those islands. We deplore the sacrifice of our soldiers and sailors, whose bravery deserves admiration even in an unjust war. We denounce the slaughter of the Filipinos as a needless horror…. We demand the immediate cessation of the war against liberty, begun by Spain and continued by us. We urge that Congress be promptly convened to announce to the Filipinos our purpose to concede to them the in dependence for which they have so long fought and which of right is the irs…. as greatly as we regret that the blood of Filipinos is on American hands, we more deeply resent the betrayal of American in stitutions at home. Between 1899 and 1902, the League distributed documents written by Filipinos. Among these were Emilio Aguinaldo’s “The True Version of the Philippine Revolution”; statements to U. S. Congress by Felipé Agoncillo, who had been unceremoniously shunned at the 1898 Treaty of Paris; and even a comparison of policies enumerated by Theodore Roosevelt and Apolinario Mabini. Later, after the war was declared of ficially over, the League would publish articles from Manila that were pro-in dependence. In addition, some League members wrote for new Filipino publications in the U. S., in cluding the first, the Filipino Students Magazine, founded in 1905. But opposition was not solely based on altruism. Many League members were in fact imperialists but believed the U. S. could expand with out the usual strong-arm tactics of the older empires. Andrew Carnegie, for in stance, felt the weight of U. S. capitalism would preempt such antiquated methods just by economic domination. There were those who opposed annexation for fear that Anglo-Saxon blood would be contaminated. Certain sectors of labor perceived immigrants as for ming a pool of cheap labor that would drive down wages, while agricultural enterprises feared the importation of duty-free agricultural products and the unfair competition this would generate. A middle way was espoused by the Philippine Progress League, also known as the Philippine Independence League. Less militant and hardly as popular as the AIL, the PPL proposed making the Philippines another Cuba—allowing it self-government but as a U. S. dependency. Though the pros and cons of U. S. conduct abroad was vigorously debated, it did nothing to stop the war. Might did make right, and the islands came under the dominion of the Stars and Stripes. As anticipated by the pro-annexation for ces, the Philippines became an important market for U. S. goods and in 1900 provided the base enabling the Mc Kinley administration to send U. S. troops to China to help put down the Boxer rebellion, an uprising of Chinese nationalists desirous of closing China to for eign capital and manufacture. Educating Big Brother Stoking the U. S. public’s patriotic fervor for this “civilizing” war were purported film documentaries that were in fact reenactments—obvious to to day’s film audiences but likely not to filmgoers then, since cinema was still in its early stages. Thomas Alva Edison’s studio made six newsreels about scenes from the war, in its West Orange lot in New Jersey. African-Americans stood in for Filipino soldiers, since Filipinos were routinely thought of as blacks. Inevitably, the reenactments ended with the white U. S. soldiers triumphant. These reels, amongst the earliest in stances of film as propaganda, thus helped reinforce pro- war sentiments, with its jingoistic emphasis on racial superiority, among the public. An effective tool in cultivating public sentiment favoring colonial-era philosophies that mixed so-called enlightened rule with the benefits of new markets and technology was the St. Louis World’s Fair. Opened in April and lasting to December of 1904, the fair was meant to commemorate the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. Sprawled across 1,200 acres and with more than 1,500 buildings, it was the largest of its kind in the world. Intended as a showcase of progress under U. S. rule, as well as to promote its global expansion both of trade and territory, the fair was a huge hit. And no other display was as popular as the Philippine Exhibit, which occupied 47 acres and constituted the fair’s largest. Approximately 1,100 Filipinos, of different ethnic groups, from Igorots to Visayans, from Mangyans to Moros, were brought over, presumably to educate the public but in reality served as freakish entertainment.

A disturbing aspect of the Philippine section was the consumption by Igorots of dogs. Traditionally this was done only on ritual occasions, but in St. Louis the Igorots were required to consume them daily, rendering meaningless a ritual act and adding another stereotype to the impressive roster already lodged in the Yankee mind. Other ethnicities were on display, too, from Native Americans— the latter were positioned just across the Philippine Exhibit—to Indians and Africans. The ethnocentric, racist display in St. Louis came seventeen years after a similar but smaller exhibition in Madrid, the Philippine Exposition of 1887. The centerpiece of that was an assemblage of island dwellings and about thirty Indios, a mix of Muslims and non-Christian tribespeople. The exhibition had been or ganized in part by the Manila-based Dominican Brother Pedro Payo, who in tended the display of Filipinos as proof positive that the colony was still largely “uncivilized” and demanded tutoring, particularly the religious kind. The reaction of the Madrid ilustrados anticipated that of the thoughtful observer in 1904: that the colonizer (in this case the Spanish) wished to strengthen rather than diminish the perception that the Filipinos were a backward and savage lot, thus justifying continuing dominion over them. Educating the Little Brown Brother Mass social and political movements in the islands during the American colonial period were subject to strict surveillance and militarization, impeding their growth and effectiveness. Both local politicians and U. S. colonial administrators, in their debates about self-rule, consciously and unconsciously kept the notion of in dependence from the U. S. alive in the public mind. The overt Filipinization of the colonial administration, though American control was very much in place, proved to be a powerful in centive to those who had always been ambivalent about armed resistance. President William Mc Kinley’s policy of Benevolent Assimilation was built on the premise that Filipinos would gradually be in corporated into the Pax and Via Americana through peaceful in doctrination in the principles of self-government and a cultural frame of mind distinctly Westernized and at tuned to the same cultural models as the United States. The idea was to encourage the “little brown brothers,” as Filipinos were blithely and patronizingly referred to, to emulate and identify with their bigger white brothers, thus transforming hostility into acceptance and, it was hoped, admiration. Mass education in English was undertaken early on, even when military rule was still in place, for both General Otis and General Mac Arthur viewed educating their colonial charges as an effective means of pacification. In 1901, the Second Philippine Commission, chaired by William H. Taft, performing legislative functions and supervising the establishment of local government, directed that free primary education in English be provided to the public and that Filipino teachers be trained to take over the duties borne by military men and U. S. civilian teachers, known as the Thomasites, after the USS Thomas, the for mer warship that had brought them over on August 21, 1901. That in itial group consisted of 509 young men and women, an evangelizing army eager to in doctrinate the school-boys and -girls of the islands in American ways and thus help heal the wounds of war by refashioning brown folk into the image of the colonizer. For that reason English would be the medium of in struction. A common language rendered identification much easier; it wouldn’t be too long before Filipino kids started to dream of snow, yearn for apples, and idolize fair- skinned Hollywood stars. On the practical side, English in struction would also ensure a steady supply of English-proficient civil and military personnel. The eagerness of the Thomasites to teach English to Filipinos stood in stark contrast to the Spanish who for the most part disdained to impart their language to the Indios. Education was the perfect tool for colonial administrators, as it embodied the tutelary basis of colonialism. Fred Atkinson, the first General Superintendent of Education in the Philippines, echoed that rationale when he talked about the U. S. mission in the islands: “The Filipino people … are children, and childlike, do not know what is best for them…. In the ideal spirit of preparing them for the work of governing the mselves finally, their American guardianship has begun.” In 1903, the colonial government set up a program for qualified Filipinos to be sent to the United States and there earn their university degrees. The idea was to produce trained people who would return and take over the tasks of civil administration. Called pensionados (literally, pensioners but here meaning those sent to boarding school), by 1912, over 200 men and women had received their higher-education degrees. The pensionados were usually drawn from middle- to upper-middle-class families, thus reinforcing class ties between the local elites and their U. S. patrons. With landlords, wealthy entrepreneurs, and the bourgeoisie favoring accommodation to U. S. rule, the only sectors of society that consistently opposed such rule were the working class and the peasantry. Gaining the least they despaired the most. On a parallel track, Taft in augurated a policy of “the Philippines for the Filipinos.” Fostering a kinship between the new colonizer and the Filipinos would, Taft believed, not only make Filipinos consumers of American products but also tamp down the fires of in surgent nationalism. Autonomy or even in dependence could then be sought, within rules set down by the United States. As long as the United States was in control, it could afford to put a kindlier face on military and civil repression"

As long as the United States was in control, it could afford to put a kindlier face on military and civil repression. Such assimilationist tactics combined with free- trade policies would all but guarantee the Philippines would eventually become economically dependent on the United States while acting as a source of raw materials and expatriated profits—a tutelary endeavor that benefited the tutor more than the tutee. The year after Taft took of fice, in 1902, the Organic Act of the Philippine Islands was passed by U. S. Congress. The act set up a legal framework with a marked emphasis on a colonial economy that would facilitate the operation of U. S. businesses and in vestment enterprises. It also mandated the creation of the Philippine Assembly, subordinate to the Philippine Commission, and set up posts for two resident commissioners to the United States. There would be a clear separation of church and state—as had been called for in the Malolos Constitution. The advantage to the Roman Catholic Church was that this precluded government in tervention in appointments and the creation of parishes. The downside was that public aid ceased, and priests no longer had rights and privileges when it came to public affairs. T HE C AMPAIGN FOR I NDEPENDENCE Despite the virtues of democracy and freedom being trumpeted, the Sedition Law of 1901 prohibited the public manifestation of nationalistic feelings. Whether “or ally or by writing or printing,” the advocacy of in dependence was banned. Part of the reason was that the Philippine-American War was still raging outside of so-called “pacified” areas. In a famous case, the authorities arrested the playwright Aurelio Tolentino (a pioneer member of the Katipunan), accusing him of sedition and libel. His nationalist drama, Kahapon, Ngayon, at Bukas ( Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow ), had been staged in 1903 at a Manila the ater. In one scene, a character took down the American flag and trampled it, much to the anger of Americans in the audience. The the ater was subsequently shut down. Found guilty, Tolentino was imprisoned briefly. The playwright was unrepentant: until his death in 1915, he continued to write plays and poems that portrayed Uncle Sam as a villainous character. By late 1907—five years after the of ficial “Mission Accomplished” of 1902 —Governor General James Smith had in for med President Theodore Roosevelt that a complete peace now existed, even though there were still clashes between Muslims and American for ces in Mindanao. (That island was to remain under military rule until 1914, when Manila created the Department of Mindanao and Sulu as the local administrative body.) Elections had been held earlier on July 30, 1907, for the Philippine Assembly. Competing political parties could now openly and legally advocate for in dependence. Two young politicians came to dominate the Assembly and the local political scene until the outbreak of World War II: Sergio Osmeña from Cebu and Manuel L. Quezon, from Tayabas (now Quezon) Province. A Spanish mestizo, Quezon was a lieutenant in Aguinaldo’s army and had given up once the Supremo had issued his call to lay down arms. A Chinese mestizo, Osmeña was a journalist who supported the nationalist struggle. Both were appointed governors of their respective provinces, and their administrative capabilities and in particular their successful handling of local rebellions drew the at tention of the colonial establishment. Two parties campaigned for ascendance: the Nacionalistas, whose platform centered on immediate in dependence; and the Federalistas — one of whose founders was Pardo de Tavera—whose in itial goal was limited to statehood but later shifted to gradual in dependence. The voter base excluded the majority of Filipinos, being limited to those literate either in Spanish or English and with property valued at P 500, a substantial sum in those days. Out of a population of more than 7 million, only 104,966 were registered to vote, and only 98,251— less than 2 percent of the population—went to the polls. In effect, it was the elite voting the elite in. Standard bearers for the Nacionalistas were Quezon and Osmeña, both of whom won easily, with the latter getting the nod for Speaker of the Assembly. The Assembly was for mally in augurated on October 16, 1907, and came to be dominated by Nacionalistas. Constituting the lower branch of the legislative body of the colonial government—above it were the Commission and the governor general—the Philippine Assembly spearheaded the drive for in dependence. That too was the main task set by Quezon, as one of two Resident Commissioners to the United States Congress from 1909 to 1916. With the encouragement of Quezon, in 1913 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Francis Burton Harrison governor general of the islands. Harrison continued Taft’s “Philippines for Filipinos” under a policy known as “Filipinization.” Filipinos became the majority in the Philippine Commission, the reby ensuring full control of the legislative branch of the government. Harrison also appointed Filipinos to the judiciary and to important posts in the bureaucracy. Certain departments remained, however, under direct U. S. control, in cluding education, the military, prisons, for estry, health, and the Metropolitan Water District. Harrison also or dered that the administration of Muslim Mindanao and the northern Luzon highlands of the Cordilleras be transferred from the U. S. Army to Filipino colonial of ficials, in corporating (in the ory, at any rate), these regions into the mainstream. Especially for the Muslims, this for estalled any move to wards separation from the Philippine state, but would be revived during the martial-law regime of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970 s. Quezon also lobbied for the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, otherwise known as the Jones Bill"

Quezon also lobbied for the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, otherwise known as the Jones Bill. This abolished the Philippine Commission and established a bicameral legislature. The Senate or Upper House would have twenty-two nationally elected members and two appointees to represent the non- Christian minorities. The lower house, for merly the Philippine Assembly, would have eighty elected members and nine appointees. Quezon resigned from the Assembly to run for the Senate, won easily, and was elected Senate President. Osmeña retained his speakership of the lower house. The Jones Bill also affirmed the U. S. goal of in dependence for the colony but set no date. Quezon’s support for this bill, and his belief that in dependence be with held until a majority of the population was literate, undermined the Anti- Imperialist League’s faith in him as a staunch anti-imperialist. That seemed to be the final straw for the League, which in any case had seen its membership dwindle. In 1921, the League folded its tents quietly. Governor Harrison reorganized the executive branch, now with six executive departments making up the cabinet. At the same time, the government acquired a controlling in terest in a number of businesses, such as the Manila Railroad, and set up the Philippine National Bank. In 1919, the first Independence Mission to the United States was for med, headed by Senator Quezon. In Washington, Quezon and company found President Warren G. Harding, a Republican who had succeeded Woodrow Wilson, not so welcoming, or receptive to the idea of in dependence anytime soon. Harding dispatched a fact-finding mission, made up of General Leonard Wood (the same general in charge of U. S. troops responsible for the 1906 massacre at Bud Dajo) and for mer Governor General Cameron Forbes (a grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson), to determine the readiness of the colony for self-government. The two concluded that in spite of advances, the colony was not quite ready for in dependence. Subsequently, President Harding appointed Wood as Burton Harrison’s replacement. In contrast to the affability of Harrison and his policy of Filipinization, Wood (1921-27) proved to be autocratic, probably due to his military training and temperament—diametrically opposed to the democratic spirit. He had the rather odd practice of having on hand an American witness whenever discussing weighty issues with Filipino leaders. As can be imagined, such an obvious sign of mistrust didn’t sit very well with them. Filipino politicians filed complaints against him with Harding’s successor, President Calvin Coolidge, but to no avail. Wood, a Republican, believed firmly in the role of private capital in the development of the national economy. To stimulate the growth of agribusiness, he favored the relaxation of restrictions on for eign ownership of land. Furthermore, he proposed the privatization of government-owned enterprises. The liberalization of controls was opposed by the Filipino legislators, headed by Quezon and Osmeña, who saw in these proposals a Trojan horse, by which the entry of capital-rich for eign in vestors and their subsequent control of the economy would be facilitated. Quezon, irritated by what he perceived to be Wood’s in transigence, uttered the most memorable comment of his political career: “I would prefer a government run like hell by Filipinos than one run like heaven by Americans.” At an impasse with Filipino leaders, Wood returned to the U. S. for a brain operation in 1927, but the operation was a failure and Wood died. Henry Stimson replaced him and managed to restore more cordial relations with in fluential Filipino leaders. The Depression Due to the financial meltdown that led to the Great Depression of 1929, economic in terests propelled U. S. private in dustry (agriculture, primarily) to push for Philippine in dependence. The change in status for the colony, it was hoped, would lead to the termination of duty-free exports from the Philippines. Independence would also result in stricter immigration controls vis à vis Filipino workers, now able to enter the U. S. freely and who were seen as unfairly competing on the labor market for jobs, depriving U. S. citizens of economic opportunities. Cheap Filipino labor had in fact been coming in since 1906, when fifteen young Filipinos boarded a ship for Hawaii, in itiating an exodus of Filipinos who would in the beginning provide a steady supply of labor for the farms and agricultural enterprises in Hawaii, and later for the West Coast. Filipino immigrant communities for med mostly bachelor societies—women were discouraged from emigrating, primarily to for estall the for mation of families and the putting down of roots—and would essentially remain so until the end of World War II. These pioneers and the men who followed in their footsteps came to be called the manong, or “elder brother.” By 1926, approximately 150,000 Filipinos had emigrated to work in the United States, with a spike in the exodus fueled by the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned further immigration of Japanese to Hawaii. By 1930, during the Great Depression, 75,000 manong were eking out a living in Hawaii while 60,000 worked the farms, or chards, and canneries on the West Coast, in cluding Alaska. For most of those going to the mainland, California was the favored destination. Though Filipinos swore allegiance to the United States, they were not citizens but rather “nationals.” In this in-between state, they were defined as Philippine citizens, under the protection of the U. S., free to enter the country and look for work. On the other hand, they couldn’t vote, own land, or marry white women"

S., free to enter the country and look for work. On the other hand, they couldn’t vote, own land, or marry white women. Anti-miscegenation laws in the West Coast banned marriages between white women and Negroes, Mongolians, or mulattoes—with Filipinos being classified as Mongolians. When the courts in 1931 ruled that Filipinos were not Mongolians, California legislators craftily added the phrase “or member of the Malay race” to maintain the racial ban. Being seen in public in the company of a white woman a Filipino male (or for that matter, any Asian male) was liable to be harassed and even physically assaulted by those who took of fense at such racial mixing. Anti-Filipino prejudice reflected the larger anti-Asian sentiment as expressed, for in stance, in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Labor camps were of ten at tacked by white vigilantes, with serious in juries and some deaths resulting. The most eloquent chronicler of the travails of Filipino immigrant life before World War II was the fiction writer and poet Carlos Bulosan who, like the vast majority of nationals leaving for the United States, came from peasant stock. Largely self-educated, Bulosan, an Ilocano, penned the now classic, largely autobiographical novel America Is in the Heart, an in tense and of ten feverish account of a young Filipino labor or ganizer’s political and social awakening to the harsh realities of living in a society where racism was a constant, corrosive factor, exacerbated by the Great Depression. Bulosan himself was a labor or ganizer and activist and had been in volved in efforts to unionize farm workers that helped pave the way for the birth of the United Farm Workers, headed by César Chávez, a Mexican, with the vice president being Philip Vera Cruz, a Filipino. Bulosan’s activism landed him on the FBI’s blacklist. Plagued by ill health and broke, he died of consumption in Seattle in 1956, at the age of 43. More than half a century after Bulosan’s demise, at the end of 2009, an estimated 4 million Filipinos lived in the United States, the second-largest Asian-American group after the Chinese. These U. S.-based Filipinos have a median household annual in come of close to $66,000 and are ranked second to U. S.-based Indians, who have the highest in come of all U. S. households at more than $68,000. The Philippine diaspora to tals approximately 11 million, spread throughout the globe, from North America to the Middle East to the Scandinavian countries, with occupations ranging from doctors, nurses, and computer engineers to domestic workers and merchant marines. The Tydings-Mc Duffie Act In 1932, a new in dependence team proceeded to Washington, made up of Osmeña, now a senator, and Manuel Roxas, an up-and-coming congressman. Nicknamed the Os Rox Mission, it lobbied for the passage of the Hare-Hawes- Cutting Bill, which set out the specifics of in dependence—absent from the Jones Bill. In Manila, however, the Philippine Legislature opposed it, with the opposition headed chiefly by Manuel Quezon. He cited a provision that would allow the United States to retain military bases in the country as in imical to true in dependence. In reality, he viewed approval of the bill as politically disadvantageous to his ascension, Quezon himself not having been its chief architect. With support from sugar planters, who didn’t want in dependence at all, and revolutionary figures such as Aguinaldo and Ricarte, who wanted immediate in dependence, Quezon convinced the legislature to defeat the bill. (Ricarte was still a revered figure, who, rather than pledge allegiance to the United States, chose exile in Yokohama, Japan, where he made a living running a coffeehouse and teaching Spanish on the side.) Quezon then proceeded to Washington and helped push for the 1934 Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, which was virtually identical to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill. The difference, of course, was that this time it was his name associated with the bill. The act provided for a ten-year transition period before in dependence would be granted—and during that transition period the colony would be accorded commonwealth status. As provided by the act, a constitutional convention was for med, headed by Claro M. Recto, a Quezon protégé. The body drafted a constitution that was then submitted to the U. S. for approval. Franklin Delano Roosevelt gave his imprimatur in March of 1935 and by May 14, it was ratified by the Philippine electorate. The form of government was based on that of the United States, with a bicameral congress and three separate branches of goverment: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The act also classified Filipinos as for eigners for the purpose of immigration, setting a quota of fifty for entry to the U. S. Not surprisingly, the arrangement benefited the United States more than it did the Philippines. Free trade was to continue from 1935 to 1940, with certain restrictions on Philippine exports to the U. S., but with no such restrictions on U. S. exports to the Philippines. It was easy to see why: in 1934, the colony was the ninth largest market for U. S. goods, and the first for such exports as cigarettes, galvanized iron and steel sheets, paints, canned milk, and soap. In 1935, American in vestments in the archipelago were worth $200 million. The United States was ensuring that its economic advantages would not be lost even when the Philippines gained its in dependence. Thus, the 1935 Constitution protected the in terests of U. S. citizens and corporations, according these the same property rights as Filipinos. Moreover, in dependence was to be hedged with so many restrictions that essentially rendered the country a U. S. protectorate—as had been the case with Cuba. The trade preferences would have been disastrous for the country, and vested in terests on both sides of the Pacific did little to change these"

While remedial legislation was being considered, true economic development remained a mirage. Domestically, labor and agrarian unrest continued to be a major source of concern to local governments and colonial rule. The lack of serious in dustrialization meant limited work opportunities, compounded by the fact that most arable land was concentrated in the hands of a few. Employment was available but mostly in low-paying jobs in agriculture. By 1938, out of a workforce of 4 million, more than three-fourths, made up of day laborers and sharecroppers, worked on farms and plantations. Clearly, any unrest among the ranks of agricultural to ilers would seriously affect the economic and political stability of society. The landed estates of the friars, which could have diminished the seriousness of land issues through sales to low-in come farmers, were in stead sold, as noted earlier, mainly to landlords and agribusiness. As in Spanish times, quasi-mystical peasant sects arose in response, of ten headed by in dividuals with messianic goals, but these rarely constituted a threat to public or der. Unlike under Spanish colonial rule, however, owing to a heightened sense of nationalist unity, this time there arose labor unions such as the Union Obrera Democrata. With its roots in labor activism of the past two decades, and in Partido Obrero de Filipinas, a pro-labor party founded in 1924, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) or Philippine Communist Party, was for mally or ganized on November 17, 1930, by Crisanto Evangelista, a labor militant. Active in peasant and labor or ganizations, and a firm believer in aggressive politics, the PKP quickly found itself hounded by the government. The Philippine Supreme Court declared the party illegal on October 26, 1932, for cing its key members to lead a clandestine life. Nevertheless it helped unify diverse peasant movements, especially in Central Luzon, a unity helped along when the PKP and the Socialist Party of the Philippines, founded in 1932 by Pedro Abad Santos, merged in 1938. With the outbreak of World War, II it went underground, along with other legal parties and in dividual Filipinos. But perhaps the movement with the most impact in the turbulent, Depression- plagued decade prior to World War II was the Sakdal (Indictment) movement, founded and led by Benigno Ramos. Ramos had been a protégé of Quezon when the latter was Senate President, but they had a falling out in 1930 when Quezon would not support a student protest against well-publicized anti-Filipino remarks by an American schoolteacher. Ramos subsequently established the Tagalog- language Sakdal, a weekly that regularly printed broadsides against Quezon, Osmeña, and their fellow politicians; American colonial administrators; and other pillars of the establishment. The publication grew to be enormously popular, its readership providing the base for the Sakdalista Party, established in 1933 and not surprisingly headed by Ramos. In the 1934 elections, Ramos and the Sakdalista candidates of fered the mselves as an alternative to the mainstream parties. The party platform called for immediate in dependence by December 1935, the curtailment of American control of the economy, overhaul of an educational system that was seen as too colonial, rejection of U. S. military bases in the country, and a redistribution of land. Harassed regularly by the government, the party nevertheless won three seats for the House of Representatives, a governorship, and several municipal of fices. The Sakdal leaders lost no time embarking on a campaign for the people to boycott the for thcoming plebiscite on the proposed Commonwealth Constitution. The government deemed such a campaign seditious, arrested a number of Sakdalistas, and cancelled permits for public rallies. These provocations resulted in violent uprisings in two days in May 1935, by close to sixty thousand peasants in about twenty to wns in the Tagalog provinces. The Philippine Constabulary units put down the rebellion violently, with fifty-seven peasant casualties, as the protesters were poorly armed and disorganized. Through such aggressive establishment tactics and with Benigno Ramos in Japan meeting with militaristic elements in Tokyo, the in fluence of the Sakdalistas quickly evaporated. Ramos remained in Japan until 1938; by then, the party he had founded was history— but not its profound resentments. The Commonwealth The Philippine Commonwealth was in augurated on November 15, 1935, following the timetable set down by the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, with Quezon and Osmeña elected as its president and vice president, respectively. The post of governor general metamorphosed into that of U. S. high commissioner, with Frank Murphy thus being the last colonial governor general and the first commissioner of the common wealth. President Quezon took on General Douglas Mac Arthur (Arthur Mac Arthur’s son) as military adviser to his government, with the title of field marshal came with five stars, the first American general to be so ranked. Mac Arthur would assume his new duties once he had stepped down as chief of staff of the U. S. military. He was to be aided in planning for the archipelago’s defense by Major Dwight Eisenhower. Quezon and his wife had taken a liking to Mac Arthur when the latter had been posted to the islands from 1922 to 1924, as commander of the Military District of Manila, accompanied by his first wife Louise Brooks, a wealthy divorcée. Mac Arthur was reassigned to the colony—with out Louise as they had already separated and then divorced in 1929—as department commander from 1928 to 1930"

Mac Arthur was reassigned to the colony—with out Louise as they had already separated and then divorced in 1929—as department commander from 1928 to 1930. He was recalled to Washington in August 1930, having been appointed chief of staff by President Herbert Hoover. On his return, he arranged for his Filipina mestiza mistress, Isabel Rosario Cooper, otherwise know as Dimples, to be lodged discreetly at an apartment in Georgetown. It was not uncommon for U. S. military men posted to the colony to have romantic liaisons with the local women; while winked at, such relationships were of ficially frowned upon. But there was one person whose disapproval Mac Arthur feared more than anything else: his mother, who was living with him at his of ficial quarters. He broke off with Dimples after four years, once two reporters, whom he was suing for libel, got wind of Dimples’s existence and threatened to reveal the relationship if Mac Arthur didn’t drop the court case. * And so he did. Under the National Defense Act, Mac Arthur was charged with building up an army of 300,000 troops, though in his typical grandiose manner, he declared he would have 400,00 by 1946. At the moment, he had only 10,000 in the islands. The next year, 1936, as a gesture to nationalists, the Quezon government set up the Institute of National Language, whose primary goal was to adopt and develop a national to ngue based on one of the principal native languages. By 1937, Tagalog, the language of the capital region (and of Quezon), was chosen as the basis of the national language, to be called “Pilipino”—much to the dismay of Cebuanos, who claimed to have more speakers than the Tagalogs and who were acutely aware that in spite of Cebu being the first Spanish settlement in the country, here they were, still overlooked almost four hundred years on. That same year, women were granted the right to vote. In the 1938 elections for the legislature, Quezon and Osmeña’s Nacionalistas dominated, with the opposition winning only five out of 98 seats. In 1940, the terms for the presidency and vice-presidency were changed from one six-year term with no reelection to one term of four years, with one reelection allowed— an amendment clearly meant to benefit the in cumbents. Later that year, to no one’s surprise, Quezon and Osmeña were reelected. Free Rather than Fair Trade Free trade enabled big business in terests in the colony to prosper; understandably, the American business community in Manila had misgivings about the colony getting in dependence from the United States. In little more than three decades since the start of colonial rule, the growth of imports from the United States was tremendous, in creasing ninety one times while in comparison exports to the U. S. grew thirty-two times. Eighty percent of Philippine export products were meant for the U. S. market. And 65 percent of goods brought in were from the United States. An over-reliance on the U. S. market thus made Filipino exporters uneasy about the prospects of in dependence. More importantly, it sidelined the need for in dustrialization. In public, Filipino politicians declared that free trade would hurt the economic in terests of the Filipinos, that such a policy favored vested economic in terests, opening the country’s commerce, in dustry, and agriculture to domination by American enterprises. In private, the opposition was much more muted, and after in tense lobbying, most politicians acquiesced to free-trade policies, in or der to protect their careers. At the same time, the easy access to American products worked against the emergence and development of local in dustry while cultivating in the Filipino consumer a marked preference for such products. Indeed, “Stateside” came to be a term that connoted a preference for U. S.-made products. Hence the establishment of a commonwealth that would ostensibly lead to in dependence was hedged with enough restrictions so as to ease the worries of powerful U. S. economic in terests. Independence would be granted but Philippine products would be at a disadvantage. At the same time, the Commonwealth Constitution protected U. S. business in terests so that the colony would still be a rich source of profits—as well as a base, still, for extending U. S. reach in Asia and the Middle East. In essence, the country was slowly but surely being transformed into a neo-colony, in dependent for mally but still largely tied to the apron strings of America. Land continued to be a burning issue in the countryside, with land policy mostly conservative. Although the colonial government declared its desire to broaden the base of in dependent ownership, American in terests clearly lay in not disturbing—and in deed strengthening—the system of landownership that had developed under Spain. And the ruling elite saw no reason to disrupt what had been a hugely profitable arrangement for so long. The same obstacles that had prevented a fair and equitable redistribution of land in the Spanish colonial era were still operative: poverty and ignorance, the resulting failure of many in dividual tillers to acquire the necessary land titles, and aggressive landlord resistance.

      "context": ". In essence, the country was slowly but surely being transformed into a neo-colony, in dependent for mally but still largely tied to the apron strings of America. Land continued to be a burning issue in the countryside, with land policy mostly conservative. Although the colonial government declared its desire to broaden the base of in dependent ownership, American in terests clearly lay in not disturbing—and in deed strengthening—the system of landownership that had developed under Spain. And the ruling elite saw no reason to disrupt what had been a hugely profitable arrangement for so long. The same obstacles that had prevented a fair and equitable redistribution of land in the Spanish colonial era were still operative: poverty and ignorance, the resulting failure of many in dividual tillers to acquire the necessary land titles, and aggressive landlord resistance. W ORLD W AR II AND THE G REATER E AST A SIA C O -P ROSPERITY S PHERE The 1930 s were a time of political turmoil in Japan (as they were in Germany and Spain). With very few natural resources, an expanding population, and an in creasing in dustrial output, the Japanese desperately needed for eign markets and access to raw materials. Its sizable commercial in terests in Manchuria were under threat from Chinese nationalists. Domestically pro-fascist elements came to dominate the military and political spheres. Plans were then made for a southward expansion, a policy referred to or iginally as Nan’yo that later became the more sinister-sounding “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” Due to construction of a highway leading up to Baguio City, the hill station the Americans had decided to build in the Cordilleras in northern Luzon, Japanese laborers were brought in, so that by 1903, the Japanese community in the islands numbered more than 1,000. By the 1920 s, the Japanese began to arrive in greater numbers; by the 1930 s they were a commercial presence in the archipelago. (Such presence in cluded a number of Japanese brothels in Manila and Davao, with Japanese prostitutes catering mainly to non-Filipino customers.) Trade between the colony and Japan was worth $17 million in 1931. Japanese entrepreneurs were especially active in the hemp, lumber, and fishing in dustries. In Davao, on the island of Mindanao, a sizable Japanese community had sprung up. At 18,000 strong, the Davao Japanese, a majority of whom came from Okinawa, controlled approximately 60,000 hectares—two-thirds of commercial agricultural land in the province. Employing 12,000 laborers, the Japanese had become the mainstay of economic development in Mindanao— aided by high-level, Japanese-paid lobbyists in the Quezon administration—and had helped make Davao the largest exporter of hemp in the world. Japanese entrepreneurs were active as well in the mining in dustry, establishing at least four mines. By 1934, Japanese merchants controlled 27 percent of the retail trade, 50 percent of the textile in dustry; 80 percent of the iron ore Philippine mines were producing was shipped to Japan. All these fueled suspicions that Japan was girding for war... While there was a growing awareness in the commonwealth of the threat posed by Japanese fascism, much of the Spanish community in the islands sympathized, if not openly supported, Generalissimo Francisco Franco and the fascist Falangists, who had emerged victorious at the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War in 1938. One exception was the or der of Capuchin monks, who were mostly from the Basque region, known for its fierce anti-Franco sentiments. The Casino Español, a bastion of Spanish conservatism in Manila, took down the Republican flag and raised that of Franco’s. The Catholic Church hierarchy as well as the leading Spanish businessmen and landowners, who were also close to and identified with the U. S. colonial rulers, approved heartily of Franco’s anti- Communist, anti-Republican campaign. They would be buoyed up later on by Washington’s recognition of the Franco regime. With a militaristic and expansionist government in place, Japan in vaded China’s Manchuria Province in 1937. With the on set of war in Europe and Hitler’s takeover of France, the Japanese Imperial Army pushed into French Indochina and used that as a base from which to launch further in cursions into China. In retaliation, the United States in October of 1940 halted the export of steel to Japan—an act the Japanese government deemed unfriendly. On July 26, 1941, Washington froze Japanese assets in the United States, and in August President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared his government’s opposition to in voluntary regime change and demanded that Japan with draw its for ces from Indochina and China. Later that year, trade negotiations were resumed between the two countries in a last-ditch effort to prevent further deterioration in relations that could lead to war. But by the end of November, the talks had proved useless. Preparations in the Philippines for an impending war were woefully in adequate. Quezon admitted to in sufficient food stocks, fuel, and air raid shelters. Mac Arthur seemed to have buried his head in the sand, confident as late as November 1941 that if the Japanese at tacked, it would be at the earliest in the spring of 1942. Mac Arthur was off by a season. World War II commenced for the United States and the rest of Asia when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Manila). Bombing of Manila followed nine hours later. By 3 a. m., Mac Arthur knew of the surprise at tack on Pearl Harbor but in explicably took no action. As a result, slightly past noon, Japanese warplanes found most of the U. S. planes on the ground. At least half of Mac Arthur’s air fleet was destroyed, the tragic result of nine hours of in decision. Both raids provided the dramatic opening salvo in Japan’s campaign to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and thus unite Asian countries under the Rising Sun. It was painfully evident that Mac Arthur had failed to build up a prepared army. The Japanese blitzkrieg was mostly uncontested, with Japanese troops landing in northern and southern Luzon, as well as in Davao. To spare Manila harm, Mac Arthur declared it an open city on December 26. By this time, he and other common wealth of ficials were on Corregidor Island, in cluding Quezon, Osmeña, and their families, while in Bataan, on Luzon, U. S. and Filipino troops regrouped. By early 1942, Mc Arthur, Quezon, Osmena et al. had slipped away to Australia, the nce to Washington, where a government-in-exile was quickly for med by the summer of 1942. Before Mac Arthur and Quezon went on their separate journeys out of the islands, the Philippine government, under the direction of Quezon, paid Mac Arthur $500,000 for his services to the commonwealth. Mac Arthur was free to accept any sum of money from the Philippine government as his employer"

Mac Arthur was free to accept any sum of money from the Philippine government as his employer. However, once he had been reactivated in July of 1941 as an of ficer in the U. S. military, he was bound by army regulations that prohibited its members from accepting such cash gifts. This violation of army ethical rules was never made public, nor did President Roosevelt raise any objections Less than a month after Japanese planes began their in vasion, their ground for ces rolled into Manila on January 2, 1942, and proceeded to set up a mechanism for administrative rule that would on one hand seem to give Filipinos their in dependence and on the other ensure that the country would be part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As with the Spanish and the Americans, the Japanese declared that everything they were doing was for the benefit of the natives—which worried the natives no end. In the United States, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive or der that awarded Filipinos full veterans benefits if they enlisted in the U. S. Armed Forces. In California alone, 16,000 signed up; about 9,000 for med the First and Second Filipino Infantry Regiments. Overall, approximately 250,000 Filipinos fought alongside U. S. troops in the Pacific War. However, FDR and his military advisers, in cluding General Dwight Eisenhower, decided to focus on the European/Atlantic the ater before at tending to the war in the Pacific. Eisenhower in particular argued that sufficient for ces to recapture the Philippines could not be assembled with out hurting the war effort in Europe and the Atlantic. Consequently, in spite of a gallant, against-all-odds defense, on April 9, 1942, the beleaguered Filipino and U. S. soldiers in Bataan surrendered to the Japanese. Many men under arms, however, were able to escape to nearby Corregidor. Those who surrendered were for ced to march from Mariveles, Bataan, to San Fernando, Pampanga, and the nce to prison camps in Capas, Tarlac, in Central Luzon. The march was one of the grimmer episodes of the Pacific War and has been described aptly as the “Death March,” for the prisoners trudged in the to rrid summer heat—April and May are the cruelest months of the Philippine summer —with no food or drink. Stragglers were more of ten than not bayoneted or shot on the spot. Of the estimated 85,000-90,000 surrendered soldiers, approximately 25,000 perished before reaching San Fernando. From San Fernando, the prisoners were herded into trains that took them to Capas. In barracks meant for 20,000 occupants, 60,000 were crammed. Of those 60,000, by war’s end, about 45,000 had died due to illness, starvation, and exhaustion. Meanwhile the 11,000 troops on Corregidor, under the leadership of Lt. General Jonathan Wainwright, battled valiantly, but on May 6, 1942, he and his men surrendered to the Japanese, and with that, the Japanese takeover of the archipelago was complete. A puppet government was in stalled, with the for mation first of the Philippine Executive Commission, made up of politically well-placed Filipinos, among them Chief Justice of the Supreme Court José P. Laurel, later to become the nominal president of the country. Jorge Vargas, Quezon’s executive secretary and appointed mayor of Manila just before Quezon’s departure, was named head of the commission. Pragmatic above all else, a significant portion of the elite— fourteen out of twenty-four senators and thirty-five out of ninety-eight representatives—collaborated with the Japanese command, to ensure retention of their political and economic power. Collaboration, of course, was not limited to politicians. Quite a number of for tunes were made on the black market by unscrupulous businessmen supplying the Japanese with whatever materials were needed. Focusing on the Japanese promise of in dependence, as declared by Premier Hideki Tojo, enabled elite collaborators to cite this as justification for cooperating with this new in vader. Vargas, for in stance, expressed his “confidence and trust in the true and benevolent in tentions of the Japanese Imperial Forces,” while Congressman Benigno Aquino Sr. declared that Filipinos were Asians, “not Europeans or Anglo-Saxons.” And in a letter to the Japanese high command, a virtual political Who’s Who stated their in tent “to obey to the best of our ability and within the means at our disposal the or ders issued by the Imperial Japanese Forces for the … well-being of our people.” In reality, the promise of self-rule and a cultural renaissance was broken right from the start. All in stitutions that governed or in fluenced public life and perceptions were controlled by the military. This meant a media—newspapers, radio, even printing presses—that served the propaganda needs of the Japanese. The same process was repeated for education, government of fices, and churches. Just as the United States had done with English, the puppet government or dered the teaching of Japanese, or Nippongo. The Americans were portrayed as purveyors of decadence who had placed an undue emphasis on in dividual rights. According to General Hayashi Yoshide, director of the Japanese Military Administration (JMA), the United States had led the country down the path of “deceit and misguidance.” The lesson was clear: Filipinos needed to rehabilitate the mselves. A major role for the Philippines, as with other Asian countries taken over by the Japanese military, was to provide much needed resources for Japan’s war effort, whether in the building of weapons or in feeding its troops, which at its height, numbered more than 250,000 in the islands. The diverting of crops, especially rice, to the soldiers meant great hardships for the masses"

The diverting of crops, especially rice, to the soldiers meant great hardships for the masses. The miseries they suffered, and the many acts of brutality in flicted on them by soldiers in His Majesty’s Imperial Army, undercut the stated aims of Filipinizing the Philippines, strengthening rather than weakening pro-American sentiments. Since real power lay in the hands of the Japanese military, martial law was in effect. To stress that the Japanese were serious about liberating the Philippines from colonial rule and to wean Filipinos from pro-U. S. leanings, in dependence was to be granted earlier than 1946, the date promised by the United States. A hastily assembled Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence drafted a new constitution that was speedily ratified in September of 1943, the ink barely dry on the document. Delegates to a National Assembly were elected, as decreed by the new constitution, and in turn the delegates elected Laurel as the president. With the Allied of fensive in full swing, and U. S. for ces retaking strategic islands such as Saipan, bringing them within striking range of the Philippines and Japan, the tide started to turn against the Japanese. Nevertheless, on October 14, 1943, in front of crowds assembled by the Kapisanan sa Paglilinkod sa Bagong Pilipinas (KALIBAPI) or Association for Serving the New Philippines —in reality, a nationwide surveillance network—the new Republic of the Philippines was in augurated. To appeal to nationalists, the Japanese had brought Artemio Ricarte back to Manila from exile in Yokohama, where he and his wife made a living running a coffeehouse. Ricarte, already in his late seventies and a for mer general in Aguinaldo’s army known as “El Vibora,” or “The Viper,” had steadfastly refused to pledge allegiance to the United States. Supportive of the Japanese, he was a living symbol of the Filipino struggle for in dependence. He was on hand to assist in the raising of the Japanese flag on that fateful day, alongside the Philippine flag as an allegedly in dependent Philippine state was declared. Ricarte’s time had passed, however, and he no longer had the following he had had three decades earlier. Fleeing the American army to wards the end of the war, he died of dysentery in the Cordilleras. Mimicking a regular government, administrative machinery was set in place, along with a judiciary. Filipino diplomats were posted abroad wherever the Japanese reigned supreme. On the local level, the Japanese in stituted a system of neighborhood associations that served as distribution points for commodities and a source of labor and spectators at of ficial public events. More important, these associations constituted a widespread surveillance network, or ganized by the Kalibapi, which had displaced political parties, depicted as mere mouthpieces for American propaganda. The or ganization also in cluded a sub-branch for younger members. Launched on December 30, 1942, the death anniversary of José Rizal and a nod to nationalism, Kalibapi was headed by Benigno S. Aquino, father of Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., later to become the most famous political opponent of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970 s. Along with abusive and of ten violent Japanese soldiers, the Kalibapi rendered Japanese rule despicable to or dinary Filipinos. Where before they might have viewed the United States in a similar light given the horrors of the 1899 Philippine-American War, now they came in creasingly to long for the return of the Americans. Complementing the Kalibapi’s efforts was a more in sidious or ganization, the Makabayang Katipunan ng Mga Pilipino (Ma Ka Pili) or Patriotic Society of Filipinos, which was for med by Benigno Ramos, founder of the Sakdal movement, and a long-time sympathizer of the Japanese. The Makapili were armed and collaborated with the occupiers by pointing out those who were working with the underground or who otherwise displayed anti- Japanese sentiments. Often, Makapili members—hooded in public, to protect their identities—used their position to simply settle old scores. Resistance to the Japanese was widespread. Guerrilla bands and underground in telligence units, most headed by USAFFE of ficers, were everywhere, an ubiquitous threat to the fragile stability of Japanese rule. For the most part, the resistance hewed to U. S. plans for retaking the islands. One group, though, was steadfast in its opposition both to Japanese and to U. S. rule: the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon (Hukbalahap, or Huks), or the Anti-Japanese People’s Army. Organized in March of 1942, the Huks constituted the military arm of the Partidong Komunista ng Pilipinas and at its peak counted 10,000 members. The Communist Huk leadership couched their appeal to the peasants and farmers in terms of long-needed socio-economic reforms rather than hard-core ideological lines. These left-wing resistance fighters were most active in Central Luzon, where they set up the Barrio United Defense Corps, or BUDC, to act as local government units. The BUDC was critical to the economic survival of a community, making sure, for in stance, that the harvesting of rice was done quickly and the grain distributed before the landowner and the Japanese got their hands on it. While the Huks were nationalists, for tactical reasons, they didn’t oppose the USAFFE- led units since they had a common enemy. However, not a few of the pro- American groups were hostile to wards the Huks and, as the war drew to a close, would at tack them when the occasion presented itself.

On October 20, 1944, Leyte Island was retaken by U. S. for ces and the nce the reconquest of the rest of the islands was undertaken. Accompanied by Sergio Osmeña (now the acting president, Quezon having died in August of that year in upstate New York) and Carlos P. Romulo, the signatory for the Philippines to the United Nations charter on its founding in 1946, the good general declared from Tacloban City, Leyte’s capital, “People of the Philippines, I have returned.” Mac Arthur’s dramatic announcement was made even more so by the largest naval battle of World War II and one of the largest in history: the Battle of Leyte Gulf, actually four separate engagements between U. S. and Japanese warships, from October 23, 1944 to October 26. Two hundred seventy-six warships fought it out, with the U. S. enjoying numerical superiority: 209 on the U. S. side and 67 on the Japanese. Japan lost four aircraft carriers, three battleships, ten cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Such losses crippled the Japanese navy, no longer an effective deterrent to U. S. at tack on the homeland. The battle also witnessed the first use of the kamikaze (Japanese for “divine wind”), with planes converted into suicide weapons. Before the United States had secured to tal control of the air, kamikazes had sunk sixteen U. S. ships and damaged another eighty. Prior to the beach landing on Leyte, U. S. bombers had already struck in a south-to-north pattern, hitting Davao, the Visayas, and Manila. In early January of 1945, U. S. for ces stormed ashore on the west coast of northern Luzon, and subsequently, in southern Luzon. By the first week of February U. S. armored columns were entering Manila from the north. The battle to oust the Japanese from the historic city was fierce and apocalyptic—the fiercest urban battleground in the Pacific the ater, akin to the battle for Stalingrad. Innumerable accounts tell of Japanese soldiers committing at rocities during their retreat, while for their part U. S. artillery in discriminately pounded Intramuros, the historic matrix of Manila, to rubble. The city south of the Pasig River was essentially obliterated. The month-long fighting in Manila, from February 3 to March 3, 1945, was hand-to-hand and street-to-street, with 1,010 U. S. soldiers killed, and more than 5,000 wounded. Japanese casualties were 12,000. Of the civilian population, approximately 100,000 perished. Not taking into account the U. S. at omic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki cities later that August, the devastation of Manila ranked second only to Warsaw. On July 5, 1945, the archipelago was finally wrested from Japanese occupation. The commanding general of the Japanese Imperial Army in the islands, General Tomoyuki Yamashita—known as the “Tiger of Malaya,” for his capture of Malaya and Singapore from more than 100,000 troops under British command —was charged with war crimes, particularly with the at rocities in flicted by the Japanese army on civilians in the bloodbath that was the Battle of Manila. The general’s defense was that he was no longer in Manila when the U. S. began its efforts to reclaim the historic city. He had, with most of his troops, in fact retreated to the mountainous north, where he planned to of fer fierce resistance and thus delay significantly the in evitable advance on Japan, once the Philippines had been secured by the United States. Left in charge of Manila’s defense was Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi who, contrary to Yamashita’s or ders, decided to defend the city to the death. And it was, with disastrous results. Mac Arthur or dered a trial, had a court set up, and determined the rules under which it was to operate. After a three-week trial, Yamashita was found guilty and sentenced to die by hanging. The conviction was appealed by his defense team first, to the Philippine Supreme Court, and then to the U. S. Supreme Court, the main argument being that Yamashita couldn’t possibly have had a fair trial under the conditions set up by Mac Arthur, the commander of enemy for ces. In a 7-2 decision, the Court affirmed the verdict, with the two dissenters calling the execution “legalized lynching.” The sentence was carried out near Manila on February 23, 1946, five months after the Japanese had of ficially surrendered to the Allied for ces on September 2, 1945, on the battleship USS Missouri, anchored at Tokyo Bay."

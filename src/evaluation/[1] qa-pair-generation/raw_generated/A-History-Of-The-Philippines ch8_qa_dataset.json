      "context": "AFTERWORD A s expected, Benigno Simeon Aquino III won the presidential elections held in May 2010, beginning a six-year one-term presidency. What was surprising was the candidacy of disgraced felon for mer president Joseph “Erap” Estrada, who was for ced out in early 2001, and was succeeded by his then vice-president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Running again for the highest of fice in the land, despite a pledge not to do so—a condition for his presidential pardon in 2007— Estrada placed second, in a testament to his enduring popularity as a likeable rogue. He may very well have won, had not the field of candidates split the non- Aquino votes. The in defatigable Estrada then went on to campaign in 2013 for the mayoralty of Manila, winning over the in cumbent Alfredo Lim. What have been the Aquino administration’s hallmarks in its four years in power? T HE D RIVE A GAINST C ORRUPTION The biggest accusation against the Arroyo administration was that it proved to be massively corrupt in its nine years in power. Indeed, corruption has been the single most pressing issue facing governance in the country since it became an in dependent state in 1946. In his in augural address President Aquino—referred to as P-Noy, a play on the words “Pinoy” (an in for mal term for “Pilipino”) and “Noynoy,” the president’s nickname— made anti-corruption one of his administration’s priorities, telling his countrymen, “If no one is corrupt, no one will be poor” and that the people were his “boss.” The Aquino administration didn’t lose time, moving for the impeachment of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Renato Corona, who had been a midnight appointment of President Arroyo. (For his swearing in, Aquino chose another justice of the Supreme Court to administer the oath of of fice, rather than Corona.) On December 12, 2011, the House of Representatives impeached Corona. The proceedings then went to the Senate, where he was found guilty on May 29, 2012, of the failure to properly list his assets, liabilities, and net worth. Another high-profile case was that of for mer Army Comptroller Major General Carlos Garcia—referred to in a previous chapter—who was accused of plundering millions of dollars from army funds, to enrich himself and his family as well as some members of the top military brass. The general would have escaped with a slap on the wrist due to a plea bargain wherein he would have surrendered his assets (already subject to for feiture) had not the Aquino government pushed for his court martial by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He was adjudged guilty and sentenced to 11 years behind bars. One of the most publicized anti-corruption cases has been against President Aquino’s predecessor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, widely perceived as being implicated, along with her husband, First Gentleman Mike Arroyo, in the previously noted corruption scandals that rocked her administration. A warrant of arrest was issued to the for mer president in October of 2012 just as she checked into the government-run Veterans Memorial Medical Center, on corruption charges in relation to the alleged misuse of more than $8 million in state lottery funds. There she remains, though her lawyers have requested that she be allowed to return home and be placed under house arrest. With these highly publicized cases, an improved GDP—the fastest-growing economy in Asia in 2013—and the fact that in ternational credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s have given the country an in vestment grade, President Aquino declared in his 2013 State of the Nation Address that his government was on the verge of eliminating the last vestiges of corruption. In spite of undeniable progress, this is more hyperbole than fact. In reality, government malfeasance is still widespread, deeply rooted in agencies whose of ficials and employees are not usually in the public eye. Bureaucratic corruption is particularly entrenched in such departments as the Bureau of Customs. A February 2014 study released by the Washington-based advocacy group, Global Financial Integrity (GFI) showed that, from 1960 to 2011, $410.5 billion in illegal funds flowed in or out of the Philippines: $132.9 billion in outflows and $277.6 billion in in flows. A major source of such illicit transactions is what analysts term “technical smuggling,” where importers bring in goods through the ports, pay some taxes but misdeclare or substantially undervalue the shipments. Since 1990, according to the GFI study, such undervaluations have cost the government at least $23 billion in lost revenue. The authors of the study, that corroborate earlier ones done by the World Bank and the government’s own Department of Finance, point out that the illicit in fusion of cash and merchandise abets crime and corruption, and while this helps the underground economy, it does so, for in stance, at the expense of government social programs that seek to reduce poverty. What the study doesn’t directly refer to is outright smuggling, where no duties at all are paid. Goods are brought surreptitiously into the country, either through Sulu in the south, where the borders with Borneo are quite porous, or further north, off the waters of Ilocos Norte. Because smuggled goods of fer unfair competition to domestic in dustries, many labor-in tensive in dustries such as garments and textiles, footwear and furniture have closed shop. Smuggling has even expanded to in clude rice, threatening the livelihood of farmers. Despite the fact that the Bureau of Customs is a well-known epicenter of smuggling, the government has been in consistent in cracking down on corruption within the bureau, even when the luxurious lifestyles of many of its employees raise legitimate concerns. Another stark in dication of the depth of corruption has been the scandal over the misuse of at least 10 billion pesos (approximately $250 million) worth of pork barrel funds—the Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) in tended for local projects—diverted to the personal bank accounts of certain legislators. In headline-grabbing revelations made by whistleblowers in July of 2013, taxpayers learned about an on going scheme, begun in 2003 and led allegedly by a businesswoman, Janet Lim-Napoles, wherein through fictitious projects for paper nongovernmental or ganizations (NGOs), the government issued Special Allotment Release Orders (SARO) authorizing the release of public funds. The funds, in turn, were diverted to legislators, sometimes in restaurants where bags of cash would be given to the legislators’ representatives. The government’s own Commission on Audit released a report linking many of these “ghost” NGOs to Lim-Napoles and to various government agencies. The for mer was subsequently arrested"

The government’s own Commission on Audit released a report linking many of these “ghost” NGOs to Lim-Napoles and to various government agencies. The for mer was subsequently arrested. Three prominent senators have been in criminated: Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, for mer Secretary of Defense in the Marcos regime; Senator Jinggoy Estrada, son of impeached president and Manila mayor Joseph Estrada; and Senator Ramon Revilla, Jr. son of a well- known movie star. Five for mer House representatives as well as thirty government of ficials have also been implicated. In November of 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the source of pork barrel, the PDAF, was unconstitutional—a victory for the ad hoc anti-pork for ces that were behind the August 2013 peaceful gathering in Rizal Park, the largest protest since President Aquino assumed of fice in 2010. E CONOMIC P ERFORMANCE At the end of 2013, for eign debt stood at $59.1 billion, a reduction in four percent, from $61.7 billion. In spite of the endemic nature of corruption, which resides mostly in government agencies, the Aquino administration has made some economic progress. In his 2013 year-end address, the president pointed out how the country has moved from 134 th place to 105 th, in the rankings made by Transparency International, the global coalition against corruption, linking this to healthy economic growth. Indeed, GDP at 7.8%, is one of the highest in Asia. Rotterdam Week in its assessment at the end of 2013 ranked the republic 14 th out of 15 most improved economies, predicting the country to be Asia’s fastest growing economy in 2014 and possibly Asia’s next long-term winner. It issued a caveat by pointing out that a majority of Filipinos “still have a relatively low in come though, at just $2800 per head.” Moreover, according to the nonpartisan Social Weather Survey (SWS), the unemployment rate is a high 27.5%, an in dication that while the economic tide may be rising, it isn’t raising all boats. Call Centers. Contributing to the rise in GDP has been the proliferation of call-centers, one of the fastest growing in dustries in the country, and a significant player in the global business processing outsourcing estimated at $150 billion. It seems to have replaced India as the top destination for outsourcing, though with the strengthening of the peso, India may yet regain its premier position. With its relatively low labor costs and the American-style English language skills the local workforce has, traceable to its for mer status as a United States colony, the country appeals to for eign corporations. The latest count of call centers has them at 1,000—dispersed around the country, with the majority situated in the metropolitan Manila region. Overseas Filipino Workers. While there have been encouraging signs of economic growth, overseas labor remains a linchpin of the economy, with the country, according to Congressman Walden Bello of Akbayan (Citizens’ Action Party), “one of the great labor exporters of the world. Some 11 percent of its to tal population and 22 percent of its working age population are now migrant workers in other countries.” Remittances in 2013 amounted to $22 billion, making the Philippines the fourth largest recipient of remittances, after China, India, and Mexico. Writing in 2013, Bello states, “For all in tents and purposes, the most dynamic sector of the economy is labor export. While government authorities are loath to acknowledge this, and there is only perfunctory acknowledgement of its role in the economy of the medium-term development plans, the reality is that it is labor export, with the billions of dollars it brings in to support the consumption of families of overseas workers, that keeps the economy afloat.” Industrialization. Unlike the East Asian tiger economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China, which have relied on state-driven in dustrialization as the main engine of their economies, the Philippines’ efforts in this regard have been and still are spotty. The overriding emphasis is on free-market, neo-liberal economic policies, where the state limits its role to setting and enforcing the rules, e. g. no unfair competition. It is an economic philosophy that argues against state in tervention, even to save key but ailing in dustries. The government’s own Philippine Development Plan, 2011-2016, issued by the National Economic and Development Authority, barely advocates for state in dustrial policy. Still, a more active state role has become acceptable in certain quarters in government, as evident in the drawing up of “road maps” for specific in dustries, spearheaded by the in dustry players the mselves, assisted by the government’s Board of Investments. Some road maps have been completed, notably that for iron and steel, cement and housing (which are all related) and for the copper in dustry. However, specific policy decisions recommended since early 2012 have still have to be implemented. An important one is the very strong recommendation by all the in dustries in volved in road mapping, to revive the government National Development Corporation (NDC) and the Industrial Development Council (IDC). The for mer played a key role in the in dustrialization of the country in the 1940 s– 1950 s, notably in the textile in dustry, setting up and operating textile mills. The latter was created by law during the first Aquino administration but has since at rophied. Its aim was to bring to gether all key economic managers and the private sector to draw up policies and plans for in dustrialization, to at tain policy and planning congruency and consistency.

T HE R EPRODUCTIVE H EALTH B ILL Proposed more than a decade ago, the reproductive health bill was finally signed into law by President Aquino in 2012. The bill requires the government to promote family planning, responsible parenthood, and sex education from grade five through high school. Under its provisions, both the national and local governments are to make available reproductive health services, in cluding prenatal care and the distribution of condoms, and to provide for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS cases. Given the established correlation between population and poverty, with the poor having the largest families—with a population of nearly 100 million, the Philippines is the 12 th most densely populated country globally—one principal aim is to reduce the population growth, 1.89% in 2013. In a nation that is 80 percent Roman Catholic, the bill has predictably drawn fire, principally from the conservative Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), which has consistently at tacked the bill, of ten referring to it as “Satanic” and equating its policies with legalizing abortion. Proponents of the bill point out that it does nothing of the kind since abortion is for bidden by the 1987 Constitution and is criminalized under the Philippine Penal Code. They also cite studies that show a reduction in the abortion rate when better family planning practices are encouraged and supported. T HE I NSURGENCIES The MILF and the MNLF. On the last weekend of January 2014, the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest Islamic in surgency group in the country, agreed to a cessation of hostilities in the decades-long war in Mindanao, with an estimated 120,000 casualties, thus concluding negotiations began in 1997 under the Ramos administration. Brokered by the Malaysian government, the agreement authorizes the creation of an autonomous region to be called Bangsa Moro, or Moro Nation. The region would get the lion’s share of revenues generated by its natural resources. At the same time, the 11,000 strong military arm of the MILF would be deactivated, with a significant number expected to join the government security for ces. The government expects to have a bill submitted to Congress by June 2014 that will lead to the for mal creation of the Bangsa Moro. A similar agreement had been for ged in 1996 with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)—the older group from which the MILF broke away— resulting in the creation of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Due to corruption and factional fighting, however, ARMM was dysfunctional and thus widely seen as a failure. Similar obstacles confront the MILF, in cluding having to deal with smaller but more violent extremist groups, such as the Abu Sayyaf Group. The creation of the new entity, to be done under the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), will in corporate ARMM, though Nur Misuari, the founder of the MNLF opposes this, as he opposes the agreement between the government and the MILF. The peace agreement casts into irrelevancy both Misuari and the MNLF, but no analyst expects them to remain passive on lookers. An unmistakable signal was sent to the government when on September 2013, armed conflict between government troops and an armed faction of the MNLF erupted in Zamboanga City, when heavily armed MNLF fighters marched through the city center, provoking a battle that resulted in more than 200 casualties, mostly among the rebels and severely damaging neighborhoods where the rebels had lodged. The MNLF seems to have also been in volved in an in cursion into neighboring Malaysia. In early February of 2013, about 200 armed followers of the Sultan of Sulu, Jamalul Kiram III, landed on Eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo, a province controlled by Malaysia but one still technically under the purview of the sultanate, which bills itself as the Royal Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo. Until a lease deal with the British in 1878, Sabah was under the direct rule of the sultan. Annexed subsequently by the British, Sabah was in corporated in 1963 into a newly minted Malaysia. What complicates the situation is that Malaysia pays approximately $1,700 in rent to the sultanate, which considers the sum as absurdly low, for the approximately 45,000 square mile territory that is rich in natural resources and is highly profitable. The sultanate, however, has no real power, the sultan no wealth. In comparison, the Sultan of Brunei, a distant relative having the same great-great grandfather, is immensely wealthy and was once considered the world’s richest man. Following the in itial wave of sultanate fighters, hunted down by the Malaysian armed for ces, was another group estimated at 400 armed men, most likely MNLF guerrillas, making good the MNLF’s threat of a protracted war to help their beleaguered comrades. (The sultan–who died in October 2013 at the age of 75—was close to the MNLF leadership.) It is no coincidence that the tribal group dominant in both Sulu and the MNLF is the Tausug. The New People’s Army. The New People’s Army is on its 45 th year and the spearhead of one of the world’s longest-running in surgencies. Its strength is thought to consist of between a low of 5,000 and a high of 12,000-armed fighters. Its guerrilla fronts are dispersed through Luzon, the Visayas, and parts of Mindanao. Despite peace talks that began in 1987 under the first Aquino administration, no deal approaching that concluded with the MILF is in sight. Talks have proceeded in fits and starts, conducted mainly in Europe, in cities such as Brussels, Oslo, and the Hague, where José Maria Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and other top leaders of the National Democratic Front (NDF) live in exile"

Unlike the MILF, whose rebellion centered on a specific territory (the southern half of Mindanao), the NPA, in tandem with the CPPNDF, seeks to supplant the national government with one aligned with its philosophy. H UMAN R IGHTS In its World Report 2014, Human Rights Watch said that 12 journalists were killed in 2013, for a to tal of 26 violent deaths since President Aquino took of fice in June of 2010. The creation by the government of a body in 2012 to in vestigate and expedite cases of extrajudicial murders remained largely in active in 2013. Five years after one of the most horrific massacres of civilians in post-war Philippines, dealt with in an earlier chapter, with close to 60 victims—in cluding 30 journalists—no one has been convicted in the criminal case, on going since November 2009, lodged against the powerful Ampatuan clan, widely believed to be behind the gruesome event. Two witnesses have been killed, highlighting the government’s in adequate witness-protection program. G EOPOLITICAL F RONT The biggest and potentially most explosive for eign policy issue confronting the Aquino administration is that of control over a small group of islands, the Spratlys. These tiny, mostly uninhabited (and of ten uninhabitable) islands sprawl over 160,000 square miles of the South China Sea (which the Philippine government refers to as the West Philippine Sea, and the Vietnamese as East Sea). Situated off the coasts of Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, and China, they are believed to hold 5.4 billion barrels of oil and 55 trillion feet of natural gas. Some of the globe’s richest fishing grounds are to be found here as well. Additionally, half of the world’s merchant fleet and one-third of its crude oil pass through these waters. The most powerful claimant is the People’s Republic of China, which has also been the most aggressive in pursuing its territorial aims in the region. Asserting that its claim is backed by historical records, the PRC points to its principal exhibit: a nine-dash map, with the nine dashes marking the outer limits of its claim, proceeding in a clockwise arc, from off the coasts of Taiwan to Vietnam. In effect, the PRC claims sovereignty over 90 percent of the waters. Their territorial layout in trudes into the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of the other Southeast Asian countries. As defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention of Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS), each nation’s EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from its shores. The Spratlys, for in stance, are 135 miles off Luzon and about 400 miles from Hainan, China’s closest island. The Philippines has asserted its sovereignty, terming them the Kalayaan Island Group. However, it effectively controls only five islands, two sandbars, and two reefs. It has asked the UN to adjudicate—China and the Philippines are both signatories to UNCLOS—but China has refused to participate. Instead, it in sists on bilateral talks, where it can exert much more pressure, rather than multilateral ones that could be set up through the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), many of whose members also have claims over the same area. The map above shows the Chinese government’s claim to the South China Sea, with nine unconnected dashes marking the outer limits of its territory. The Philippine government hopes both public pressure and a favorable UN ruling will mitigate the overriding military muscle of China. The Aquino administration is also relying on the mutual defense treaty between it and the United States, in case armed conflict breaks out with its hugely powerful neighbor. President Aquino has likened the situation to Nazi Germany prior to World War II, urging the global community to help it stand up to China. In an in terview the president declared: “Remember that the Sudetenland was given in an at tempt to appease Hitler to prevent World War II.” Indeed, the rise of China as a preeminent force in the Asia Pacific region has resulted in the so-called U. S. “pivot” to ward Asia, to counterbalance China’s ascendance and aggressive posturing, which in cludes claiming airspace, or Air Defense Identification Zone, over islands controlled by Japan but whose sovereignty is questioned by China. The ADIZ also overlaps with South Korean airspace. The standoff with China has given the regular joint U. S.-RP military exercises, termed Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder), heightened importance. It has also led to a modest buildup of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Airforce. In early 2014, Manila contracted to purchase from South Korea 12 FA- 50 fighters as part of a five-year $1.68-billion modernization program, to bolster its defense capabilities. Delivery of the first jets is expected in late 2014. The government has hired U. S. defense contractor Raytheon to devise a system for maritime border security, and plans to acquire six unmanned drones for surveillance and reconnaissance. Further complicating relations with China has been the on going contretemps between the Special Autonomous Region of Hong Kong and the Philippines, stemming from the murder of Hong Kong to urists in Manila on August 23, 2010.

In the botched at tempts to rescue the hostages, Mendoza killed eight to urists before he was shot dead. The handling by local authorities was severely criticized, and universally condemned as in ept, especially when it was revealed that a SWAT team was on hand but not called upon"

N ATURAL D ISASTERS On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (named Yolanda locally) the strongest typhoon recorded to ever make landfall, with the winds clocked at an astonishing 195 mph, struck the islands of Leyte and Samar in the Eastern Visayas to devastating effect: more than 6,000 dead, an estimated 6.6 million people displaced, 1.1 million homes destroyed or severely damaged, 33 million coconut trees downed or damaged, and 30,000 fishing vessels wrecked or swept away. An estimated $14 billion in damages were in curred, and national economic growth is projected to suffer a 1 percent decline in 2014. The hardest hit city was the capital of Leyte, Tacloban, with 90 percent of its buildings destroyed or severely damaged. The estimated period of recovery for the region is at least five years. The typhoon had come roaring out of the Eastern Pacific, right where the Eastern Visayas islands are, in an area dubbed “Typhoon Belt.” The fast-moving Yolanda kept barreling west, making four additional landfalls in the Visayas, then tacking slightly northwest before crossing the sea and hitting Vietnam, albeit in weakened form. Complicating immediate relief efforts was the fact that a great many of the first responders were the mselves affected by the storm. With a breakdown in law and or der, in evitably looting broke out, due to the dire circumstances and the survivors’ need to obtain food, clothing, and shelter. Yolanda came three weeks after an earthquake, in tensity 7.2 (the deadliest in 23 years), on October 15 struck the Visayan islands of Bohol and Cebu. More than 220 people died, and close to a thousand were in jured. More than 14,500 structures collapsed, among them, centuries-old churches. Damage was estimated at P 2.25 billion pesos, or approximately $50 million. While Haiyan did not directly strike the earthquake disaster zones, it further strained resources, though massive for eign aid did pour in. The extreme nature of the typhoon was exceptional. However, with weather patterns being affected by climate change, such typhoons may become the norm. The Philippine government, much-criticized for its relief and recovery efforts, has its work cut out as it seeks to prevent the kind of widespread havoc wreaked by Haiyan/Yolanda.

The Philippine government has tried unsuccessfully to have the bells returned to the town of Balangiga. * The two journalists were Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen. They had criticized the government’s violent dispersal of several thousand Bonus Marchers—World War I veterans who had encamped in the summer of 1932 with their families near the Capitol—demanding immediate cash redemption of certificates they has been given for their service. Mac Arthur had been in charge of the dispersal. * Close to a thousand civil and criminal cases had been filed against the Marcoses, but a majority of the cases were dismissed for lack of evidence. In 2007, sixty remained to be resolved. The Steel Butterfly has never spent a day in prison and no one bets she will anytime soon. * See the excerpt from his press release that begins this chapter."

EXPEDITIONS, ENTRENCHMENT, AND SPANISH COLONIAL RULE, 1521-1862 “The method which they pursued was consistent with the practice of those nations in for ming a friendship—a method not altogether their own, as it was a custom among the most ancient heathen peoples, ment ion of which we find in serious authors. Those who made peace in the name of the rest, and established the pacts of perpetual friendship, pricked and wounded their own arms; the Indian sucking the blood of the Spaniard, and the Spaniard that of the Indian. In this wise they became as if of the same blood, and were closer than brothers. These are called sandugo, which means ‘consanguineous,’ or ‘of the same blood.’” —Pedro Chirino, S. J., Relación de las Islas Filipinas, 1604 I N 1517, AN INTREPID AND BATTLE-TESTED THIRTY-NINE-YEAR-OLD Portuguese navigator by the name of Ferdinand Magellan, out of favor with the crotchety Portuguese King Manuel, crossed the border into Spain and convinced its young, adventurous seventeen-year-old Hapsburg monarch, Charles, to finance an ambitious undertaking: He, Magellan, would discover a new route to the fabled Spice Islands by sailing west across the Atlantic, to South America, from where he could then sail to the desired destination with out running afoul of his countrymen, Spain’s fiercest rivals. Magellan assured the Spanish court that his voyage would observe the line of demarcation Pope Alexander VI had drawn, essentially dividing the planet between Catholic Spain and Catholic Portugal. Established on June 7, 1494, the demarcation was one hundred leagues west of the Azores and Cape Verde: All lands west were marked for Spain; east, for Portugal. However, if land in either half was already ruled by a Christian sovereign, it was to be left alone. Everything else was up for grabs. A simple enough agreement, yet the papal bull was constantly challenged to suit the agenda either of the Portuguese or the Spanish. This in terminable wrangling led to modifications through the 1506 Treaty of Tordesillas (a small town in northern Spain). The line was moved 370 miles west of Cape Verde, approximately in the middle of the Atlantic. The papal blessing provided Spain and Portugal with the ological cover for their voyages of conquest and the brutal but profitable undertaking of land expropriation and exploitation of in digenous peoples, otherwise known as colonization. Through the conquistadors and the civil and religious personnel that followed in lockstep, Rome extended its reach wherever these two European countries planted their flags—a perfect combination of economic enterprise, worldly power, and religious zeal. Magellan’s voyage was financed of ficially by the Casa de Contratacíon in Seville. If the venture succeeded, it would guarantee much needed revenue for the Spanish treasury. On August 10, 1519, the flagship Trinidad, the Victoria, San Antonio, C on cepcíon, Santiago, and 260 men under the command of Magellan slipped their berths at Seville and sailed down the Rio Guadalquivir and into the Atlantic. Accompanying the voyage was Antonio Pigafetta, a young and healthy Venetian nobleman eager for adventure, whose journals of the expedition constitute the main source of what we know to day about this precedent-setting expedition. After an epic voyage filled with extraordinary adventures, hardships, maritime disasters, and a mutiny that nearly succeeded, the fleet, reduced to three, discovered the straits, now bearing Magellan’s name, that lead to the Pacific Ocean—so christened by Magellan as his expedition happened upon that great body of water, when the storm season hadn’t yet begun. Entering the vast and calm ocean, the ships tacked their way across for more than three months with out being able to reprovision—causing untold hardships and deaths—before sighting the Marianas (present-day Guam) on March 6, 1521. Magellan and his men named it Isla de Ladrones (Isle of Thieves), for the in habitants’ light- fingered proclivities, though the in habitants, for ebears of latter-day Chamorros, had been generous with their food. (This could have simply been a case of cultural misunderstanding: what the Europeans considered theft, the islanders thought of as sharing.) In punishment, Magellan or dered his men to burn some of the natives’ homes, killing seven men as a result. According to Pigafetta’s account, crew members who were ill asked that the entrails of a dead man be brought to them, “for immediately they would be healed”—a request that suggests pre-Christian beliefs coexisting with Christian ones on board. Magellan and his men pushed on and, on March 16, 1521, came across Homonhon, an isle off the Pacific-facing coast of Samar, a much larger island in the archipelago yet to be named the Philippines. The ships had sailed into the eastern flank of the Visayas, the archipelago’s central region. That day being the feast day of a saint, Magellan christened the islands aptly enough the Archipelago of San Lazaro, as the for tuitous landfall meant a revival of their lives, if not their for tunes. The Visayans, whom the Iberians subsequently referred to as pintados, for the elaborate tattoos that marked them, proved hospitable. From Homonhon the expedition proceeded to the island of Limasawa south of Samar. There several large boats approached the ships, boats that Pigafetta noted were called balanghai and that on the average measured approximately eighteen meters long. Pigafetta, whose journals provide a fascinating, first-hand account of this historic voyage, loved to make lists, and in one, he enumerated words from the language of the islanders—words that are used to this day. In another, he itemized products and domestic animals he had come across, among them: rice, ginger, or anges, lemons, sugar cane, garlic, honey, bananas, corn, millet, citrus, wax, goats, chickens, dogs, cats, and pigs. In addition, there were cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg—all valuable spices—as well as, and more importantly, gold. He noted the practice of betel-nut chewing and cockfighting—both common in Southeast Asia. But of all the tropical produce that Pigafetta got to know, it was the coconut that so enchanted him he deemed it the near-perfect food. He was convinced two trees could sustain a family of ten for a hundred years. On Easter Sunday, in a portent of impending Christianity, the priest accompanying the expedition celebrated mass on Limasawa. Thence, guided by Limasawa’s datu (a lesser-ranked ally of the datu of Butuan, the much larger port in Mindanao, further south), the ships proceeded to the busy port city of Cebu, arriving on April 7. Acting as the translator and in terpreter was Magellan’s Christianized Malayan slave, Enrique de Malacca—Malacca being the port and slave market where Magellan had bought him. Malacca was Southeast Asia’s principal entrepot, a vital transshipping port in the trade routes that extended on one end from the Mediterranean to southern China, at the other"

Malacca was Southeast Asia’s principal entrepot, a vital transshipping port in the trade routes that extended on one end from the Mediterranean to southern China, at the other. Enrique may not necessarily have been from Malacca, or from the Moluccas. The young man, as it turned out, not only looked like these pre-colonial Filipinos, he also spoke their to ngue. He may very well have been from the central part of the archipelago. And in deed, if he were, this slave (whom Magellan in his will decreed be set free upon his death) would the refore have been the first known in dividual to have completed a circuit of the Earth before Sebastian Elcano and the few survivors of the Magellan expedition returned to Sevilla in 1522. Cebu was ruled by Rajah Humabon. After a short period of unease between the pragmatic native king and the imperious navigator—the for mer had in itially demanded tribute from the latter, as was traditionally expected from ships bringing goods—the two sides settled into what presumably was an amicable relationship. It helped that a Muslim trader from Siam, knowing something about the rather brutal history of conquistadors, had advised Humabon to come to some sort of accommodation with Magellan. Consequently, Rajah Humabon agreed to an alliance with Spain, wherein the rajah not only acknowledged Spanish sovereignty but also converted to the Catholic faith, along with his principal consort and his subjects. Humabon was baptized Carlos, after the Spanish monarch, and Humabon’s queen, Juana, after Carlos’s mother, Juana la Loca (Joanna the Mad, so named for her ment al in stability and her bizarre, fetishistic desire to keep the corpse of her husband Philip the Handsome close by her). Newly converted, Humabon complained to Magellan about a petty ruler from nearby Mactan Island—across the straits from Cebu—by the name of Lapu Lapu who would not bow to either the cross or the Spanish crown. Given the highly decentralized nature of Southeast Asian chiefdoms and competition for trade, Humabon may very well have enlisted the unsuspecting Magellan in a strategy to get rid of his rival. Despite the sage advice of his of ficers, who rightfully pointed out that they had no business in terfering in local affairs, and, more importantly, feared losing all their hard-earned gains, Magellan decided to teach Lapu Lapu a lesson, with only sixty men—all volunteers—in three long boats, and in the process impress his native ally no end. Magellan had by now been in fected with evangelical zeal, his head full of grandiose notions of lording it over the archipelago. Being viceroy of the islands would have made him and his family unbelievably rich and vindicated his defection to the Spanish court. Humabon of fered Magellan a contingent of his warriors, but Magellan disdained the of fer, boasting that one of his men, clad in body armor, was worth a hundred of the enemy. He had earlier arranged a display showing his armored men repelling blows. Besides, his ships’ cannon were larger and more powerful than the lantakas, or artillery, of the enemy. It was an empty boast: as dawn broke on April 27, 1521, Magellan and his armed party of sixty waded ashore on Mactan and there engaged Lapu Lapu and his men. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered—Lapu Lapu had tricked his enemies into coming in at low tide, so the Spanish ships were anchored too far out for their cannon to be effective— the to ugh, forty-one-year-old Magellan paid for his adventurism with his life, cut down on the beach as his companions, their ranks depleted, fled to the longboats. Pigafetta, who had fought that day, mourned Magellan’s death, calling him “our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide.” The aftermath of the battle was bloody as well. Enrique, wounded at the battle on Mactan, had been humiliated by Duarte Barbosa, now one of the two leaders of the expedition (the other being João Serrão), who refused to give him his freedom, as promised in Magellan’s will. Enrique convinced Humabon to in vite the of ficers and crew to a banquet. There, in a scene worthy of Shakespeare, Humabon’s guards slaughtered twenty-six of them, in cluding Barbosa. Humabon was willing to have Serrão ransomed for the gifts the rajah had given Magellan, but João Carvalho, who had escaped the massacre and assumed command, refused. Serrão, according to Pigafetta, “prayed God that at the day of judgment he would demand his soul of his friend João Carvalho.” The survivors sailed off in the three ships, but scuttled one off the waters of Bohol Island, leaving only the Victoria and the Trinidad. And only the Victoria, of the or iginal five, completed the circumnavigation of the globe, limping into Sanlúcar de Barrameda in 1522, three years after the expedition set out. Just eighteen of the or iginal complement of 260 men survived. With Sebastian Elcano as the pilot, the crew was said to have been the first to circumnavigate the globe. But the slave Enrique de Malacca may have beaten them to the punch. The voyage had ended disastrously for Magellan and all the hardy souls who perished on that mind-blowing trip, but it prepared the way for four other Spanish expeditions. A FTER M AGELLAN, THE D ELUGE The first post-Magellanic expedition was headed by Francisco García Jofre de Loaísa, with Elcano as his second-in-command. Seven ships and 450 men set off in 1525 from Coruña, Spain. Unfortunately, it was a voyage marked, even more than Magellan’s, by disaster. By the time it had navigated its way through the Straits of Magellan, only two vessels were left. Subsequently, Loaísa and Elcano died within a few days of each other. Two more successors perished.

Few survived, only eight returning to Spain in 1536, in cluding Andrés de Urdaneta, who would return with the Legazpi expedition. As directed and or ganized by Hernán Cortés, famed conqueror of the Aztec empire, the second expedition of three ships and 110 men, under the command of Alvaro de Saavedra, departed Mexico in 1527—the first Spanish voyage to Asia launched from the New World. Saavedra bore a royal letter for the ruler of Cebu, apologizing for Magellan’s conduct and at the same time seeking to ransom any Spanish prisoners the good rajah might be holding. But only one ship reached Mindanao. Unable to locate Cebu, Saavedra sailed to Tidore in the Moluccas, where, meeting the remnants of the Loaísa expedition, he and his men were taken captive by the Portuguese. Released, he set sail for Mexico, but died at sea. In the meantime, under the Treaty of Zaragoza of 1529—yet another renegotiation of the line of demarcation—Madrid gave up its claims to the Moluccas in return for 350,000 ducats from the Portuguese. Being west of this demarcation, the Philippines was the or etically within the ambit of Portugal, but Spanish at tempts to colonize the archipelago did not cease, nor did Portuguese harassment of the Spanish, until it became clear that the Spanish had successfully colonized the islands. The third expedition, made up of six ships and 300 men, set sail from Navidad, Mexico, on November 1, 1542, under Ruy López de Villalobos. After landfall in Palau and the Carolinas, the expedition arrived at the east coast of Mindanao in 1543. In Sarangani, the men started a colony, but lack of food for ced them to sail to Tidore, where, not surprisingly, the Portuguese held them captive, and where Villalobos expired, at tended to by the brilliant Jesuit missionary and future saint, Francis Xavier, later to head to Japan, the nce to China, on pioneering evangelical missions. It was the Villalobos expedition that christened the islands Filipinas, after Felipe, the son of Charles I. The final and most successful expedition was commanded by Miguel López de Legazpi, a Spanish Basque conquistador who had arrived in Mexico in 1530 and prospered. By the time of the Legazpi voyage, Crown Prince Felipe, or Philip II, had grown up and now occupied the Spanish throne. A zealous Catholic and partisan of Mary, Queen of Scots, claimant to England’s throne, he detested the English Protestant Queen Elizabeth. In 1588, Philip assembled a mighty fleet of warships, known simply as the Spanish Armada, consisting of 130 ships, with 8,000 sailors and 18,000 soldiers. Its purpose was to in vade England, but Philip’s much-vaunted armada was humiliated by the British navy in a series of engagements. The royal treasury had in curred tremendous expenses in assembling the Armada, and new sources of revenue, such as the Philippines promised, would be in valuable. Legazpi’s mission, as all the previous ones, was to secure a base in Southeast Asia and the nce establish a route back to Mexico, so that precious cargo could be transported sans in terference from the Portuguese. As with the other would-be conquistadors, Legazpi would be richly rewarded with money, trade concessions, and land. In the agreement between the Spanish monarch and the conquistadores, the Crown reserved certain rights in the colonies while the latter enjoyed the spoils of conquest. Thus, the desire for riches and prestige furnished powerful in centives for the men who undertook such dangerous expeditions, as they did for the royal court. Legazpi’s expedition left Navidad on November 21, 1564. Urdaneta, now a member of the Augustinian or der, was coaxed out of retirement from a monastery in Mexico to pilot successfully the fleet to Cebu. (On board were six other members of the Augustinian Order, the first to undertake the Christianization of the islands.) Urdaneta then returned to Mexico in 1565, charting the route to be used in the galleon trade between Manila and Mexico that would be the new colony’s financial lifeline for two centuries. Other key members of the Legazpi expedition were Martín De Goiti, Legazpi’s grandson Juan de Salcedo, and Miguel de Loarca, who was to write Relación de las Islas Filipinas, a detailed account of his stay in the Philippines. Legazpi and his men began a sustained and ultimately successful effort to colonize the islands, with the Spanish Basque becoming the first governor general of this latest addition to the Spanish Empire. Guided by Spanish colonial experience in both Americas and decrees from Madrid, Legazpi, as well as his successors, devised and enacted certain measures for the pacification and administrative control of the archipelago and to strengthen and protect Spanish sovereignty from enemies within and with out. The colonial apparatus set in place was in tended primarily to facilitate the exploitation, rather than the progressive development, of the islands for the benefit of the Crown and, in the process, enrich those who had claimed and ruled the territory on behalf of the monarch. From the outset the in digenous population was viewed through the prism of racism and a deeply held sense of cultural superiority. Unfortunately, having to deal with an in ferior race was the cost of doing business. Legazpi, like Magellan, in itially based himself in Cebu, which the Spanish christened Santissimo Nombre de Jesus or the Most Holy Name of Jesus after a statue of the Santo Niño, or Holy Infant, a gift from Magellan to Rajah Humabon’s Queen Juana, was found by a soldier in a hut.

Harassed by the Portuguese, who believed that the islands fell within their side of the demarcation, Legazpi moved to nearby and more easily defended Panay Island. Seeking, as Magellan did, to strengthen his alliance with local datus, Legazpi entered into a blood compact in March 1565 with two chiefs of Bohol Island, Datu Sikatuna and Datu Sigala. It was a move precipitated by the fact that two years earlier, in 1563, according to Legazpi’s account of the voyage, the Portuguese had, under the guise of friendship, plundered Bohol. The datus and their followers were the refore understandably wary of these strangers who resembled the Portuguese. Hearing of a larger settlement up north blessed with an excellent bay, on the island of Luzon, Legazpi sent an exploratory mission, under the command of Goiti and De Salcedo. That settlement was Maynila, at the mouth of the Pasig River, its ruler Rajah Suleiman. Maynila was a large, for tified port, with cannons for ged in foundries right by Suleiman’s royal compound. The Pasig was an important artery leading to the lush lands east and south of Maynila, as well as to the country’s largest freshwater lake, later named Laguna de Bay, and passage upriver required tribute paid to Maynila’s ruler. Prior to 1565, Muslim port communities had already established the mselves north of Mindanao, in Mindoro, and in Luzon, principally in the Maynila region and in what is now the province of Pampanga. The datus in Maynila and Tondo (across the river) were converts to the Muslim faith. Loarca noted that the river delta in habitants were Moros — the Spanish word for “Moors,” or Muslims—and that they had the art of writing, in dicative of the fact that pre-Hispanic Maynilans possessed not only their own script, but were aware of Bornean and Arabic writing. The Goiti mission made overtures to Rajah Suleiman, but suspicious of the Spanish, the rajah rejected these, and in evitably fighting broke out. Goiti emerged triumphant and Maynila was burned to the ground. On the departure of the Spanish for Panay, however, Suleiman and his men returned to rebuild the port. The next year, 1571, the Spanish returned, this time with Legazpi himself in command of a larger force that in cluded twenty-seven boats (most supplied by the Visayans), 280 Spaniards, and a contingent of pintados, or Visayan warriors. Rather than yield, Suleiman or dered Maynila razed once more. Later on Suleiman would assemble a coalition of like-minded datus from barangays in nearby Bulacan and Pampanga, but the native force was decisively defeated. With Suleiman’s defeat, on June 3, 1572, Maynila was designated the seat of Spanish power in the islands, its name streamlined to Manila. Strategically located and fronting a magnificent bay with a natural, deep- water harbor, Manila was granted a royal charter, which described it as the “distinguished and ever loyal city of Manila.” Inhabitants of the new city were to be limited to Spaniards. In the process of this gentrification-cum-segregation, the native residents—disparagingly called “Indios”—were for ced to resettle elsewhere. Manila was to become the capital of the newest colony, made up of Luzon, Visayas, and parts of Mindanao. While the colony was for mally named “El Nuevo Reyno de Castilla,” most preferred the easier-to-say Filipinas, and that is what stuck. Acquiring its own coat-of-arms, Manila was planned as a European-type city, with a grid of streets and a main plaza, around which were to be the cathedral and various important public edifices. Sites were designated for monasteries, schools, and hospitals, as well as for a fort (the extant Fort Santiago), which would have its own smaller plaza. By 1603, for midable stone walls and a moat encircled the city, hence the name of Intramuros. By then there were approximately 600 houses within, while another 600 houses were located with out. One estimate of the archipelago’s population at the time put it at close to a million—a low-population density (Sumatra alone had a population of 2,400,000). Probable causes of this were the agricultural labor expected of women, abortion, disease, and warfare. With Manila now in Spanish hands, and with smaller Spanish settlements in Cebu and Panay, Legazpi turned to the business of expanding and consolidating Spanish sovereignty. His in trepid grandson Juan De Salcedo headed an expeditionary force that traveled as far south as the Bicol Peninsula, along the way winning some 26,000 Tagalogs over to the Spanish Crown, in variably by persuading their local datus that it was in their in terest to be allies rather than foes. In Paracale, Bicol, they came across what every conquistador dreams of: gold mines. Subsequently, Legazpi or dered De Salcedo north, where, with the aid of Rajah Lakandula, ruler of Tondo and uncle of the impetuous Suleiman, he was no less successful, putting down resistance in the provinces of Zambales, Pangasinan, and the Ilocos region. During his sojourn in the tribal lands of the Ilocanos, Villa Fernandina (named in honor of Fernando, eldest son of Philip II) was founded. It is now the city of Vigan, capital of the province of Ilocos Sur. Though harried by the Portuguese, perhaps the greatest threat to early Spanish dominion came from the seagoing Chinese warlord Limahong, who appeared off Manila in late 1574, commanding a flotilla of sixty-two warships, 2,000 warriors, and as many seamen, along with artisans, farmers, and women. By this time, Legazpi had died of a heart at tack, succeeded by Guido de Lavezares. Confident that he could overwhelm the Spanish, Limahong sent an at tack force of 600 men, commanded by his Japanese lieutenant with the Sinicized name of Sioco.

The Chinese force assaulted Manila but were repulsed by the garrison there. De Salcedo, who had in the meantime marched south from Vigan—or Villa Fernandina, which he had been granted as an encomienda or district over which an appointed Spaniard ruled—arrived to take over the defense of the city just before Limahong himself, still confident of victory, landed with the bulk of his men. Complicating matters was a revolt threatened by Rajah Lakandula and Rajah Suleiman, as the conflict with Limahong loomed. The two rulers felt their prerogatives as chiefs were being ignored by the Spanish. De Salcedo won them over by promises of reforms and concessions. Together with his Filipino allies, de Salcedo and the battle-tested Spanish soldiers beat Limahong’s army back to their ships. The Chinese warlord sailed up the northwestern coast to Pangasinan, perhaps thinking to settle there, but Salcedo and his by now larger force pursued and destroyed the Chinese fleet, though Limahong escaped. The Spanish weren’t the only ones desirous of seeing the corsair dead. The Chinese imperial government had sent over a high-ranking of ficial in 1575 to request the repatriation of Limahong, though that was no longer possible. But the Spanish, under the direction of Governor General de Lavezares used the occasion to send a delegation to China, to establish friendly relations and trade. Indeed, Beijing sent over an emissary in 1576, to conclude a commercial treaty, and immigration from the Middle Kingdom was encouraged as a source of skilled and cheap labor. While friendly relations with China ensured that the Iberians didn’t need to worry about threats from Beijing, Chinese immigration would periodically contribute to rising tensions between the Spanish settlers and the growing numbers of Chinese laborers and artisans. There were at tempts to restrict the in flux to no avail. In 1603, the Crown decreed that no more than 3,000 Sangleys (from the Chinese phrase for traders) be allowed to live in the colony, proposing that ships from China be sent back “full of people. In this way they can be removed and the country cleared of them, with more gentleness and kind treatment, as has already been done with many of them.” The tensions would sometimes lead to armed uprisings and the in evitable bloodbaths that followed. Governor Arandia in 1578 might have for eseen this when he at tempted to supplant the Chinese with mestizos and a larger in flux of Spanish. But Spain was too far, and China too near, for this to succeed. And the Chinese émigrés, with a presence then as now throughout Southeast Asia, had excellent survival as well as artisanal and trading skills to flourish in an environment that was to them far more conducive to growth than in China. By the end of the sixteenth century, more than 20,000 Chinese resided in the Parian district, just outside the walls of Intramuros, outnumbering the Spanish. The rapid growth of the Chinese immigrant community made the Spanish uneasy, and when a Chinese mission arrived in Manila in 1603, desirous of obtaining gold, the suspicions of the Spanish civil authorities were easily aroused. They in stituted precautionary measures that in turn in flamed the resident Chinese, who decided, under the leadership of Juan Bautista de Vera, a Chinese convert to Catholicism, to strike the first blow. Their assault on Intramuros was repulsed, however, and the rebels fled to the mountains of Laguna and Batangas, where they were defeated by the Spanish for ces—a combination of Spaniards, Filipinos, and even some Japanese. About 23,000 Chinese were killed as a result. There were other revolts by the Chinese, for in spite of restrictive measures against their immigration, their numbers in creased steadily. In 1639, in the town of Calamba, not far south of Manila, they took up arms against the local authorities and succeeded in destroying and plundering more than twenty to wns before the rebels were defeated. In 1662, following the example of Limahong almost a century earlier, Koxinga, a Chinese warlord who had conquered Formosa, threatened to in vade Manila unless the Spanish paid him tribute. The Spanish refused, to no consequence. The Chinese threat to the Spanish would be mainly from within, but the tensions would diminish as the Han immigrant communities set down roots even as they expanded. In addition to the Chinese, the Japanese also had small communities in the islands, for, as the Chinese, though not as numerous, the Japanese had been a presence even before the arrival of the Spaniards. There were Japanese communities in a neighborhood of Manila (present-day Paco) as well as in Bulacan, and in what was to become known as La Union, a coastal province up north. Salcedo had run-ins with Japanese ships off the coast of Pangasinan in 1572, and in 1583, a Spanish captain engaged the Japanese by the mouth of the Cagayan River.

S EVENTEENTH C ENTURY: S ETTLEMENTS T HROUGHOUT THE A RCHIPELAGO By the beginning of the seventeenth century, largely through the foundational and level-headed leadership of Legazpi, the sword arms of de Salcedo and Goiti, alliances with regional datus, and the missions established by hardy friars, the Spanish exercised sovereignty, even if only in rudimentary form, in Luzon (except for the mountainous regions up north and the eastern coast) and in much of the Visayas. By no means did this mean the disappearance of threats from with out or within. All throughout Spanish rule, such threats existed, from small- and large-scale revolts, for eign in vasions, harassment out at sea, and the ever- present threat from the Muslim south. The Protestant Dutch constituted the most serious threat to Spanish hegemony. Dutch warships threatened Manila and its surrounding settlements at least on three occasions, between 1600 and 1647, but each time were repulsed by the Spanish and their Filipino conscripts. Early on, there was some discussion as to whether it was worth keeping the islands. Legazpi, writing to the King in 1569, was convinced that the islands were worth holding onto, that “if the land is settled and peopled by Spaniards we shall be able to get plenty of gold, pearls, and other valuable articles…. [T]hus partly through commerce and partly through the articles of commerce, the settlers will in crease the wealth of the land in a short time.” Madrid finally decided to stay put, persuaded as well by the friars that the archipelago could be a base for missionary for ays to mainland Asia, and by its own ambition of extending its empire throughout the East. Indeed, from time to time, Spanish ships sailed out of the islands on exploratory expeditions or to do battle in defense of their colony. Until the eighteenth century, the Philippines served mainly as a military outpost, subsidized by grants from Nueva España, or Mexico, the galleon trade, and tribute from the in digenous population. The new colony was ruled by the Spanish king, of course, but through the viceroyalty of Mexico. The archipelago’s Governor and Captain General was to be the King’s representative in the islands, enforcer of the Patronato Real (Royal Patronage) and overseer of the King’s in terests. The Patronato Real was essentially a Crown policy that set rules for the presence and behavior of the Catholic Church in the colonies, guaranteeing that this would be under the supervision of the throne and of the particular colonial government. In effect, the clergy became part of the government, bringing about a union of church and state. As it turned out, this marriage proved to be more felicitous for the for mer than for the latter. As a reward for his success in driving away the in fidel Moors to wards the end of the fifteenth century, the Catholic King Ferdinand had asked for and received from the pope the right of patronato real over all churches to be established in the territory of the reconquista. This was exactly what the Crown wanted, and Ferdinand skillfully maneuvered the reafter to secure from the papacy extensions of his patronato to all his overseas dominions on the ground that evangelizing the heathen, or Indios, was the same as recovering Granada for Christendom. Evangelical work in the new territory thus came under royal supervision. Since the colony was to be administered from Mexico, Rome had no direct contact with the clergy in the new lands. The Spanish monarch also had veto power over the promulgation of papal bulls and exercised through his viceroys close supervision over ecclesiastics in his dominions. The Crown energetically used this prerogative, thus precipitating constant conflicts between, on one hand, Madrid and its servants, and, on the other, Rome and its men of the cloth. The Patronato Real was the primary in strument by which Spain could recruit the Church, as a complement to its rising commercial ventures. To speak of the Church in the Philippines during the Spanish regime was thus to speak of the Spanish clergy and the Spanish empire, each serving the ends of the other. Even though spreading Christianity and converting the natives to the faith was the primary justification for the Spanish presence, the king as patron of the Church in the Philippines had the authority to determine the limits of the mission territories and approve the assignment of missionaries. He also had the duty to protect them as well as provide for their support. In addition to being representatives of Rome, the friars were in effect salaried employees of the Spanish court. The supreme authority in the administration of the colonies would lie in the hands of the Council of the Indies, created by Ferdinand and reorganized by Charles in 1524. On behalf of the throne, the Council enacted laws and decrees to govern the colonies—the compilation of which came to be known as Leyes de Indias. As with other Spanish colonies, Las Islas Filipinas was to have the Real Audiencia, a legislative-judicial body. There would be a full panoply of civil servants while a separate set of of ficials managed the Spanish king’s personal estate in Las Filipinas.

In sum, this Asian colony was to be governed in a manner similar to Spain’s colonies in the Americas. Encomiendas and Tributes One mechanism by which control was exercised was through the encomienda. An encomienda was not a land grant, but rather a system—adapted in all the Spanish colonies—under which an encomendero (the term comes from the Spanish encomendar or “to entrust”) was charged with a number of natives living within a specific geographic area whom he was supposed to in struct in the Catholic faith and the Castilian to ngue. Natives living within the encomienda were deemed subject to Spanish sovereignty, with the encomendero taking on the role of petty king. He had the power to collect tribute, basically a tax, and to expect unpaid labor, or corvée, from the in habitants of the encomienda. The tribute furnished the revenue for such expenses as those of the missionaries imparting Christian doctrine and running the encomienda. It provided the encomendero and his family with their means of living. The encomienda was usually the reward for military men who had participated in the conquest and could be in herited for two, sometimes three, generations. After the limit had been reached, the land, or more accurately, control over it, reverted to the Crown. The movement of the natives was regulated to ensure a steady supply of labor and the systematic and prompt collection of the tribute. The encomendero was charged with ensuring the well-being of the Filipinos, a duty that in cluded a good Christian education. Unfortunately, the battle-tested encomenderos treated the natives more like delinquent military units than a community of human beings, abusing them by exacting both tribute and labor. The encomienda system also gave the encomenderos a pretext for seizing land from barangay in habitants. The system was finally abolished in 1720, though in the mid-nineteenth century, there still existed eleven encomiendas. The encomienda was an important tool in the early stages of Spanish colonization, rewarding those who had served the Spanish throne well. (Such was the case with Miguel de Loarca, an early chronicler of the Spanish conquest and member of the Legazpi expedition, given an encomienda on Panay island.) While the encomienda encompassed native settlements, it was not to be confused with a hacienda. The latter meant that ownership of the land resided with an in dividual, and those working the land were his tenants. He could dispose of the land freely, and his family in herited the land. In contrast, ownership of land within an encomienda remained with in dividuals and their families. Upon the death of a landowner, rights to the land passed on to his or her heirs. In the absence of heirs, ownership of the land passed to the barangay or town, which could then utilize that property to help pay for the town’s tributes. The encomenderos enjoyed their privileges fully but barely fulfilled their obligations. To them, Filipinos were little more than a resource to be exploited. Far from the administrative reach of Spain and even of Mexico, and with the colonial state apparatus stretched thinly, an encomendero was and usually did act like a petty tyrant. He in variably demanded that the Indios in his encomienda serve him and, if he didn’t get what he wanted, would punish them. According to the friar Martín de Rada’s account, “We have gone everywhere with the mailed hand; and we have required the people to be friends, and then to give us tribute. At times war has been declared against them, because they did not give as much as was demanded.” De Rada characterized the tribute demands as “excessive” and reported that the encomenderos “maintain stocks, in which they keep as prisoners the chiefs … who do not supply the amount of tribute.” Tribute was exacted from males between the ages of nineteen and sixty. Payment of tribute from slaves owned by the native nobility was required as well. If the slave was a sagigilid, then his or her master paid the tribute. A namamahay, on the other hand, living apart from the master, had to shoulder the tribute. (These conditions applied as well to the Spanish who did have slaves, though later they were for bidden to acquire them.) The encomendero kept a quarter of the tribute, a quarter, went to the friars, and the balance to the colonial government. In turn, the encomendero maintained peace and or der, helped the missionaries in their apostolic work and ensured the encomienda’s readiness to come to the defense of the colony, should this be required. In addition, the local population was obliged to render a certain amount of personal service to the Spanish, whether to the encomendero, the gobernadorcillo (“little governor” essentially the town mayor), or the parish priest. Men between the ages of sixteen and sixty were expected to donate their labor, known as polos y servicios, for forty days each year to so-called community projects. These services ranged from servant work and the supply of foodstuffs to shipbuilding and military service, which in turn could be anything from crewing on a warship to working in artillery units. The exaction of for ced labor—especially in the felling of trees and the building of ships—that continually disrupted livelihoods (such as working on one’s land), would be a constant irritant to the subject populace and perpetual in citement to rebellion. By the time of Legazpi’s death of a heart at tack in 1572, he had assigned 143 encomiendas to his men. Guido de Lavezares, his successor, not only assigned new encomiendas but reassigned those that fell vacant, thus disregarding explicit or ders that such vacancies revert to the Crown.

Once an encomienda did fall under the jurisdiction of the Crown, it was looked after by an alcalde mayor, who collected the tributes and answered only to Manila. Such were the abuses and cruel exactions from the encomenderos, and later from the various government of ficials who would take over their functions, that the local populations wound up impoverished and degraded—conditions they now had to endure regularly and so very different from the lives they had led prior to Spanish rule. In many in stances, the conditions approached those of slavery, leading friars to complain—though, as the friars the mselves grew to be very much a part of the colonial establishment, these diminished as their own abusive behavior in creased. By midseventeenth century, as more and more administrative positions were taken over by the civil government, the number of private encomiendas dwindled with the corresponding in crease in Crown lands. Keeping the Filipinos in Line Combining the exactions of tribute and physical labor with the imperative of gaining converts to the Catholic faith demanded a framework for control. In practical terms, this meant in tegrating the or iginal barangay into such a framework. Given how few the Spaniards were, and how much larger the native population, how was this to be accomplished? Part of the answer lay in resettlement, or reducción, wherein a large number of barangays lost their autonomy and were consolidated to form pueblos, the agglomeration of which, in turn, constituted the provinces of the new dispensation. In Spain’s South American colonies, resettlement was implemented jointly by church and state. In the Philippines friars shouldered the lion’s share of the burden. It was only natural that there would be opposition to the resettlement program, for it meant whole villages being uprooted from areas where they had their fields and lived for generations. A number of techniques were employed by the clergy, and by the civil authorities as well, to convince the reluctant native to move, such as gifts of housing within the reducciónes. Barangay chiefs were given titles and awarded honors. Too, the the at ricality of church rites—from the saying of Mass to the administering of the sacraments—seemed to have been another at traction. Otherwise, backed by soldiers, the friars resorted to threats. Quite of ten, aware of the power of the friars, in habitants of barangays would elect resettlement under the charge of the religious to secure protection from the oppression and cruelty of the encomenderos. Some sort of compromise allowed those still reluctant to move into the reducción itself to live in nearby areas, giving rise to the poblacíon (town) and barrio (outlying district) system which continues to this day. The church in each poblacíon symbolized the power of the colonial state as much as the municipio, or town hall, the seat of civil authority, and served as the focal point of the cultural and social life of the town. Similar to that of Intramuros, the layout of each pueblo centered on a town plaza, around which were situated the church-convent, the municipio, and la escuela or schoolhouse, embodying the hierarchy in colonial society. Naturally, the homes of the town’s more prominent citizens—members of the principalia, or power-holders—were located at or near the plaza, a nod to their importance. As go-betweens for both the colonizer and the native population, the principalia identified and were identified with those above them, their in creasing wealth creating a gap separating them from the rest of their countrymen and leading to a class structure more pronounced than in pre-colonial days. More of ten than not, these of ficials were drawn from the ranks of the pre-Hispanic elite—ensuring the survival of a significant portion of the old ruling class. It was lucrative for for mer datus to be believers not only in the faith of the church but in that of the Spanish state as well. The highest position open to the Filipino was that of gobernadorcillo, the equivalent of town mayor. He was the colonial state’s point man, as it were, collecting tributes and mobilizing labor for government projects. Any shortfall he had to shoulder, otherwise he could be fined or, worse, imprisoned. The advantage of course was that the system could be gamed so that the position provided the of ficial a steady and relatively easy means of making money. The new settlement pattern was partly determined by the notion that every resident live abajo de las campanas, “under the bells,” or within hearing distance of the church. Being able to hear the bells meant being able duly and faithfully to at tend mass, and respond to a call to arms should the need arise. More importantly, it placed a majority of the town’s in habitants within the immediate or bit of the cleric, ensuring that the people had to be in a Spanish friar’s doctrina, or mission station, for their in struction in the faith. There were those who, desiring not to live too close to the town center, moved to the surrounding barrios where they straddled two worlds, that of their traditional ways and that of the colonizer and learned early on how to move easily between two cultures, in effect creating a third space. They lived in subordinate villages or barrios and in even smaller communities called sitios. There was a practical reason for this: many resisted moving far from their fields. The clergy adapted by constructing chapels in the larger villages and making periodic visits to say mass and teach the catechism, which practice came to be known as visita.

Native life under the colonial regime acquired a complexity not heretofore known. Each colonized Filipino was expected to live in a pueblo for purposes of civil government; be part of a doctrina, for religious in struction; and of an encomienda for the exaction of tribute, produce, and labor. T HE F RIARS AND THE C IVIL S TATE: W HO R EIGNED AND W HO R ULED? An on going debate, and at times open conflict, during the Spanish colonial period, was between the religious or ders and the civil administration. Underlying the debate was the question of who was truly sovereign in the archipelago, the Vatican or Madrid? It was clear from the Patronato Real that the Spanish monarch held sovereign sway over all matters pertaining to the conditions in the colony, be these in the secular or the spiritual realm, in cluding oversight of the appointment of religious personnel to the distant colony. On the ground, however, it was a far different story as to who held actual power, at least as far as the local populace was concerned. The distance from Madrid meant relatively few lay peninsular Spaniards made it to Southeast Asia. The peninsulares (as they were called) were augmented by Mexican Spaniards, but the aggregate still wasn’t sufficient. Hence, the religious did double duty, as spiritual and material administrators, wherever they had set up missions and, later, in parishes under their control. The subsequent in crease in prestige and material wealth of the friars led to power struggles with the colonial establishment. Invariably, the priests would claim the authority of the papacy to justify their position and resist the authority of the archbishop who nominally had jurisdiction over parishes. One of the early in stances of the two spheres conflicting was in the case of encomenderos, who were mostly ex-military men. As noted, the encomienda system was rife with abuse. The friars complained of such abuses—which in cluded the encomenderos’ with holding the friars’ fair share of the tributes—to the colonial government and to the King. The discord between the encomenderos and the friars was really about power: Who was to be the guardian over the lives of the encomienda’s in habitants, whose labor and property, after all, served as the source of both their revenues? But friar complaints were of ten seen as self-serving. In the late sixteenth century, one governor general, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, for example, felt the friars were using the alleged abuses to highlight what they believed to be their own superior qualifications. The not-so-hidden rifts between the civil and religious worlds could be traced to the question undergirding Spanish presence on the islands: What was the moral and legal basis of their sovereignty over the populace? The arguments propounded basically rested on the rationale that colonial presence was a mutually beneficial and legitimate compact between the Filipinos and the Spanish overlords. The Spanish king promised them even- handed administration, protection from their enemies, and religious education. It was as though in dividual pacts between the datus and the Spanish—the ones between Rajah Humabon and Magellan, and Sikatuna and Legazpi, being the prototypes—held true for all of the islands. In effect, the population was being asked to believe that their subjugation was really their liberation. In sum, Spanish colonial Philippines, though less than a perfect union of Church and State, could be “viewed either as a civilizing Church or a missionary State,” as the late, twentieth-century Filipino Jesuit historian Horacio de la Costa put it. With so many fresh souls to be harvested—one could say the colony for med a kind of spiritual Spice Islands for missionaries—priests were in demand for this faraway outpost of the Spanish empire. At the outset, those assigned to Las Islas Filipinas were experienced and genuinely committed to the spiritual goals of a missionary life. The first Bishop of Manila, the Dominican Domingo de Salazar, convened a council of clerics in 1582. Through his urging the council declared that sovereignty and adjudication “by natural right belong to the Indios and neither the King nor the Pope can take it away from them…. the Indios are as free in their lands as the Spaniards are in the irs, and their liberty is not taken away by the King or by the Gospel.” Such noble sentiments, being resolutely anti-colonial, were easily and subsequently disregarded, as the trappings of power came to fit the friar as comfortably as they did the civilian administrator. The economic and social privileges granted to them by the king gradually resulted in the lowering of standards, in tellectually and morally. The very real possibility of getting materially rich made priesthood in the Philippines a lucrative proposition; God’s calling the cover under which Mamon could be served eagerly and faithfully. The early years of hardship and asceticism gave way to pampered living. Thus, for in stance, by 1698, the Manila archbishop, on his visitation to certain parishes in Laguna, where friars acted as parish priests, had to for bid the exaction of fees from the parishioners for the performance of the sacraments. Charging a fee to hear a confession was not uncommon (anticipating, perhaps, the fees charged by modern-day psychiatrists). For Holy Communion to be administered to the dying, in stead of the priest making a house call, the family was obliged to carry the in dividual to the church. Otherwise the family would have to pay a fee. In his book The Roots of the Filipino Nation, Onofre D. Corpuz remarks that “this had been the practice of the Spanish friars and curates since the early days of Hispanic Christianity in Filipinas"

Thus, for in stance, by 1698, the Manila archbishop, on his visitation to certain parishes in Laguna, where friars acted as parish priests, had to for bid the exaction of fees from the parishioners for the performance of the sacraments. Charging a fee to hear a confession was not uncommon (anticipating, perhaps, the fees charged by modern-day psychiatrists). For Holy Communion to be administered to the dying, in stead of the priest making a house call, the family was obliged to carry the in dividual to the church. Otherwise the family would have to pay a fee. In his book The Roots of the Filipino Nation, Onofre D. Corpuz remarks that “this had been the practice of the Spanish friars and curates since the early days of Hispanic Christianity in Filipinas. Previous or ders prohibiting this practice … were ignored.” Exorbitant fees effectively made the poor even poorer. In addition, the friars charged parishioners for supplying them with religious items such as rosaries and required them to provide both personal services and food—of ten, with a surplus that the good friar could then sell for profit. Nor was concubinage uncommon, leading to the popular albeit exaggerated observation that most Filipinos to day have some friar blood in their veins. Geographical distance and consequent isolation rendered consistent supervision difficult. And relying on the friars for administrative tasks, normally the province of civil servants, frequently resulted in their spiritual calling too of ten taking a back seat. There were friars who stuck to their spiritual calling, of course, but absolute power corrupts absolutely. With their economic power, in dispensable role in civil administration, and spiritual authority of ten wielded with the threat of excommunication, the friars succeeded in marrying their avowedly spiritual goals to the less pristine pursuit of material gain—with the latter assuming a more prominent role than would be seemly for the demands of a spiritual life. In this the friar was aided by the principalia, who had vested in terests in the status quo; the in roads Catholicism had made into in digenous culture; and the availability of armed force should the Indios prove to be too restless under the strict rod. This unusual combination of power and prerogative made the friar the principal figure in each community and the Church the de facto dominant in stitution in the country. A major reason for the ensuing corruption of the friars was land, now a commodity subjected to in dividual ownership, a concept the Spanish had in troduced to the islands. Being in charge of parishes (normally reserved for the secular clergy, or diocesan priests who did not, unlike the friar, belong to any religious or der and were the refore under the direct supervision of the diocesan bishop), the friar or ders could own lands for their support. In time, the clergy replaced the encomenderos, whose arbitrary and exploitative practices they used to denounce. How did the men of the cloth acquire lands? By royal bequest; donations; in heritances from the pious desirous, no doubt, of assuring the mselves a place in heaven; through the outright purchase of property from the locals with the money the friars had gained from church fees, from trade, or from the produce of lands earned through for ced labor; and from for eclosures, the tenant farmer unable to pay the money he had borrowed, most likely from the friars the mselves, and thus for ced to give up the land he had pledged as collateral. The principalia, agents of the Spanish colonial apparatus, also took advantage of the privatization of property, disregarding the tradition of communally held land. Land was previously seen principally as a source of food for consumption and barter and not an in dex of wealth. The principalia were able to acquire in dividual and legal titles to land, with the resident tillers now as tenant farmers —a new and disempowering status. During the seventeenth century the process of transferring more land to fewer people grew apace, so that by 1800 the provincial hierarchy, heavily dependent on agriculture, was made up of the estate-owning friar or ders, the land-owning principalia, and the local populace— the latter consisting mainly of tenant farmers and agricultural laborers. Those working the friar lands—whether simple tenant farmers or in quilinos, natives who had the means to sublet their leases to tenant farmers—had no recourse when their rents were raised almost every year. When accepting rent in kind, the friars determined the value of the goods, naturally below market rates, since they were powerful enough to fix the prices at which produce was to be bought and sold. Aside from their in vestments in land, the or ders were actively engaged in the commercial life of the country. Through benevolent associations known as obras pias, which in effect acted like commercial banks, they in vested in various commercial enterprises. Parishes were thus run like the colonial state that engulfed it: a seemingly endless source of profit that could be justified, and was, by the earthly demands of their, the friars’, spiritual mission. Building the road to heaven didn’t, after all, come cheap. Since pacification rested mainly on the in digenous embrace of Catholicism, the religious played an in or dinate role in maintaining Spanish power in most communities. Moreover, in so many of the barangays, no other Spaniard existed but the good friar, the only symbol of colonial authority. Governors of ten complained of clerical abuses and appealed to Madrid to keep the clerics in line. A number of them took steps to curb the clerics’ power but their efforts were for the most part successfully rebuffed. Perhaps the most extreme reaction to an activist governor was in 1719, when Governor General Fernando Bustamante—a military commander of high rank and the first such to be appointed governor general of the Philippines—was slain by a mob led by friars, who stormed the palace, overpowered the guard, and knifed the governor and his son to death. The governor had apparently found out that the friars had borrowed heavily from the government and from the obras pias. Bustamante demanded repayment of the loans and, to assert his authority, had the archbishop imprisoned on charges of having conspired against the government"

Bustamante demanded repayment of the loans and, to assert his authority, had the archbishop imprisoned on charges of having conspired against the government. In another, earlier clash between the civil and religious spheres that ended bizarrely, Governor General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, Spanish governor of the Philippines from 1635-1644, exiled Archbishop Hernando Guerrero to Mariveles, a remote town across the bay. The cause for this humiliation? The prelate, along with most of the clergy, was enraged when the governor had a Spanish artilleryman by the name of Francisco de Nava dragged out of the San Augustin Church in Intramuros even though he had claimed sanctuary. Nava had knifed his female ex-slave to death in front of the church for refusing to marry him. He was tried, found guilty of murder, and hanged at the gallows erected right across from the church. To the clergy, particularly the Augustinians, this was a brazen in sult. The archbishop had religious rites and services suspended. Once Hurtado stepped down, the clergy (except for the Jesuits, who thought Hurtado had justifiable cause to ignore the right of sanctuary) in sisted he be brought to court and punished. And so he was, found guilty and imprisoned for five years before finally being freed by royal or der. It is said that as part of his sentence he was compelled to stand at the doors of churches, clad in the drab at tire of a penitent, holding a lighted taper and a rope around his neck. It wasn’t as though the civil authorities the mselves were models of democratic behavior and restraint. They were no less exploitative. For in stance, the Guardia Civil, the nineteenth-century successor to local militias and essentially a police force found in major to wns and villages, was much feared by the local populace for their of ten arbitrary and abusive behavior, as were petty town of ficials. In effect, extracting the most profit out of the colony turned into a fierce albeit unofficial competition between two rival spheres. D EVELOPMENT OF THE I SLAND E CONOMY Galleon Trade The galleon trade, the foundations for which had been laid by Andrés de Urdaneta’s successful return voyage to Mexico in 1565, in volved the highly profitable shipment of goods from Manila—goods that for the most part came from China—to Acapulco. The voyage from Manila took four months, with the ships in cluding in their cargo spices, ivory, porcelain, lacquerware, and processed silk. The goods were then transshipped overland to Veracruz, where they were loaded onto ships bound for Spain. Payment was in Mexican silver, so the galleon returning from Acapulco would be laden with the highly prized metal, along with provisions and passengers bound for the islands, providing a tempting target for privateers roaming the Pacific. This trade was monopolized by Spaniards in Manila—and even then, only a select group that in cluded the governor general, members of the Royal Audiencia, and the religious or ders. Mexican silver helped sustain the colonial enterprise and was highly valued in China. Very little Philippine produce or products were shipped out, hence the galleon trade did little to spur domestic manufacture. Precisely because the galleon trade was profitable, the Spanish colonists paid scant at tention to developing either the agricultural or manufacturing in dustry. The lucrative Manila-Acapulco run led merchants in Spain, particularly in Cádiz and Sevilla, to petition the Crown to limit the number of ships that could ply the trade route. Hence, starting in 1593, only two ships a year were permitted to sail between Manila and Acapulco. Exports from Manila were limited to P 250,000 * worth of goods (later in creased to P 500,000). Mexican goods brought back were not supposed to exceed double the value of the exports. The profits from the galleon trade made Manila a prosperous city, evident in the construction of solid buildings and outer walls and the availability of luxury goods for those who could afford them. By 1650 the population of the Walled City and its surroundings was approximately 42,000. Most of the Spaniards in the islands were concentrated in Intramuros, while a thriving Chinese community occupied the Parian district, which lay just outside the city walls. As an in dication of continuing Spanish distrust of the Chinese, on the thick walls of Intramuros facing the Parian were cannon trained on the district, in case its residents suddenly got restless. But the galleons carried more than goods, bringing letters and decrees to and from Spain and Mexico, as well as new species of crops, such as maize, avocado, to mato, cacao, and sweet potato. (The word for the latter is kamote in Tagalog, camotli in Nahuatl.) And of course human cargo: of ficials, clerics, soldiers, etc. Inevitably, these commercial and administrative links between Mexico and Las Islas Filipinas had a cultural impact. A tangible symbol of those days and one of the most venerated icons in Philippine Christianity is the Black Nazarene, ensconced in a shrine at Quiapo Church in the heart of Manila. Carved by a Mexican craftsman and brought to the colony during the seventeenth century, the Nazarene is the object of daily veneration by countless worshippers, an adoration that reaches its climax every January 9, when it is paraded through the surrounding districts, pulled by men and only by men, amidst sweaty, swaying throngs of believers who at tempt to wipe their handkerchiefs on the icon in the hopes that its miraculous power will somehow be transmitted.

The trade between Mexico and the Philippines meant small colonies of Filipinos taking up residence in the New World, and likewise, Mexicans staying on in the Philippines. Probably the earliest settlement of Filipinos in the New World was made up of crew members who jumped ship when the galleons docked at Acapulco, the earliest know in stance being in 1618, when seventy- four Filipinos stayed on. Filipino sailors were to settle elsewhere in the Mexican state of Guerrero and even in the bayous near New Orleans. These Louisiana Filipino expatriates were the reafter referred to as the Manilamen. The earliest recorded settlement in the United States was circa 1850, when St. Malo, a small fishing and shrimping village of Filipinos, as well some Chinese and Native Americans, grew on the outskirts of New Orleans. (In 1883 the Anglo-Greek immigrant Lafcadio Hearn wrote a feature on the village for Harper’s Weekly, and described its in habitants as a “swarthy population of Orientals—Malay fishermen who speak the Spanish creole of the Philippines as well as their own Tagal and perpetuate in Louisiana the Catholic traditions of the Indies.” In 1890 Hearn moved to Japan as a correspondent. There he married, took on the Japanese name of Koizumi Yakumo, and acquired a reputation as a popularizer of traditional Japanese culture.) Essential to the way the island economy took shape were the Chinese, already living, as we have seen, in the archipelago, albeit in small numbers, when the Spanish arrived. Their numbers grew, however, once the Spanish had settled in and exerted control over the islands. The presence of the Europeans and the galleon trade meant an expansion of commerce—with Manila as the transshipping port—and the acquisition of the much-valued Mexican silver. Spanish presence also meant the demand for the services of Chinese artisans. Gradually, the in flux of traders and artisans, mostly from the southern coastal provinces like Fujian, Amoy, and Guangdong, caused the resident communities of Chinese to expand. Relying on the profitable galleon trade and the prerogatives of colonial government (especially the polos y servicios) to lead privileged and of ten luxurious lives, the Spanish left the retail trade and the crafts to the Chinese who came to dominate both. Thus was laid the foundation by which the Chinese assumed a prominence, if not dominance, in the economy that continues to the present. Soon ubiquitous in the rural areas, the Chinese merchants acted as in termediaries between the cash system and the product-or iented native economy. And so Chinese retailers and tradesmen had an enormous impact on the colony’s economic life, distributing Chinese goods to Philippine villages and selling local products to the Spaniards. In this way, too, the Chinese dispersed through the archipelago, to as far south as Muslim Jolo, seat of the Sulu Sultanate. Consequently, the Philippine economy developed three distinct tiers: that of the Spanish, that of the Chinese, and that of the natives—corresponding to the existence of three distinct cultural communities. Intermarriage did occur frequently between the Chinese and the locals, so that by the late eighteenth century, enough Chinese mestizos existed as to be classified separately by the government. (In addition, to ease the suspicions of the Spanish, many Chinese converted to Catholicism.) The existence of these distinct economies would in variably be affected by the country gradually opening up to global markets, especially by the middle of the eighteenth century (a globalization that moved along on cultural and political axes as well as economic ones). Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, and with an in for mal network already in place, the Chinese more than the colonizing Spanish assumed a larger and more vital role in the economic development of the country, the Chinese being the middleman, buyer, and of ten the supplier in the numerous to wns and villages upended the pre-conquest economic patterns of the Filipinos. Especially in the retail trade, the Chinese rose to preeminent positions. For all that, government regulations were antiquated, the product of a vanished era. Some at tempts at the close of the eighteenth century were made to in stitute far-reaching economic reforms that would have helped the colony metamorphose into more than just an outpost of a declining empire and source of raw materials. By then, the colony’s population stood at a million and a half, with the bishoprics of Manila and Cebu consisting each of 500,000 in habitants.

The company also hoped to spur domestic manufacturing through the exploitation of natural resources. An at tempt to compete with textiles from Bengal and Coromandel, however, resulted in heavy losses. And by 1790, the company had yet to establish trade relations directly with India, China, or Japan, relying as before on middlemen in Manila. As much as an agent of change that it may have been, the Company’s privileges were revoked, and by 1834 the agency was abolished. It had proven to be a complete failure, crippled by consistently bad management and excessive speculation. The colonial government declared Manila to be a free and open port in 1789 for a limited time and made permanent in 1805. In 1796, the first American merchant ship docked in Manila. By 1814, Manila had a vibrant community of for eign merchants. (In the Visayas, the ports of Iloilo and Cebu were declared open to for eign trade in 1855 and 1865 respectively, resulting in the local economies expanding and a corresponding in crease in the ranks of the petit bourgeoisie.) Even so, the for eign merchants could only trade in Asian goods and were not allowed to participate in the trade between the colony and Spain. Easily circumvented, these restrictions were gradually lifted. With that, more than two centuries of isolation ended. This opening up to the West, for it was the West that most avidly desired it, took place more or less at the same time other Asian ports were opening up: in China, Japan, and Siam (present-day Thailand). The opening up of Manila meant that the once-sleepy port was now booming. Trading ships from Europe and North America made regular calls. The city’s population grew to approximately 150,000 by the middle of the nineteenth century. Migrants from nearby provinces flocked to the city for jobs as well as for higher education and cultural enrichment—the typical lures of any developing urban center. It accelerated the opening of the rest of the country while for eign in vestment and capital stimulated the local agriculture in dustry. This was especially true in the sugar, abaca, and copra in dustries. Technological improvements, the rising demand for these products in in ternational markets, and the subsidies provided by for eign traders and importers led to dramatic in creases in yields for these crops. They had become prime commodities globally, though naturally subject to the vagaries of the marketplace. Sugar was a prime illustration. Until the mid-nineteenth century, sugar was a bit player in the Philippine economy. But with Iloilo as an open port in 1855, the sugar in dustry took off on Negros Island, across Guimaras Straits, its soil perfect for sugar cultivation. The island population in creased dramatically, from 30,000 in 1850 to 320,000 by 1893, as land was cleared for sugar plantations and to wns were built and in frastructure put into place. The in troduction of steam-powered mills in 1860 by British merchants, much more entrepreneurial than the Spanish, caused a 600-fold in crease in output, from 200 tons in 1850 to 120,000 tons in 1893. Similar in creases in sugar production took place in Central Luzon as well. By the close of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, sugar constituted a major source of export earnings. The abundance of sugar meant the production of rum, of which sugar is the most important raw material. In 1860, a trading partnership and steamship company founded a few years earlier by a Spanish family, the Elizaldes, built the Tanduay distillery in Manila that to this day produces its signature rum. But while sugar provided the sweet life for a few landed families, it in turn caused dislocation and bitter misery for peasants deprived of their land. The late nineteenth-century agrarian upheaval caused by large-scale azucareras (sugar refineries) created a class of seasonal farm laborers called sacadas, who migrated to different plantations during the harvest season to work for abysmal wages while enduring degrading living conditions. (In the twenty-first century, not much has changed. The sacada is still there and so is the exploitation.) The liberalization of trade resulted in a relatively more diverse financial system. Up to then, local businessmen and farmers were subject to usurious loans, complicated by the fact that the domestic financial in stitutions were usually beholden to the friar or ders. With for eign trading companies and their financial backers on the scene, local entrepreneurs could turn to them for less on erous terms. The first bank founded by a Filipino was the Rodriguez Bank, circa 1831. Francisco Rodriguez was quite a wealthy man living in Manila when in 1823 he was wrongly accused of being in volved in a local conspiracy spearheaded by three Mexican-born Spanish army of ficers in the islands. These of ficers were accused of harboring rebellious motives, due both to Mexico’s new status as an in dependent nation and the fact that the newly appointed governor of the archipelago, Juan Antonio Martínez (1822-1825), had in 1822 brought with him several of ficers from the continent whom he favored, by passing the more senior of ficers already in the colony, among them the three conspirators. The conspiracy was found out, two of ficers were deported, and the third, Andrés Novales, was reassigned to Mindanao.

The Novales Mutiny as it was termed was the first at tempted coup d’etat during Spanish colonial rule in the islands, although one that sprung from narrow grievances rather than any newfound sense of nationalism. Implicated in the Novales affair along with several other civilians, Rodriguez was sent to Cádiz in 1825 as a political prisoner. He managed to escape and fled to London, from where he waged an unsuccessful campaign to convince his friends and relatives to plead his in nocence before the civil authorities in Manila. Unable to gain access to his riches, he became destitute and undoubtedly would have died penniless and heartbroken had he not been taken in and cared for by Quakers in London, with whom he lived for five years. Not surprisingly, Rodriguez became a Quaker as well as a British subject. By then, the Spanish government pardoned all those in volved in the uprising. Rodriguez returned to Manila, where he established the Rodriguez Bank, to assist for eign traders, primarily American and British, in their dealings with Filipinos and in direct competition with Spanish financiers. Mindful of the difference between how he had been treated by the Spanish and the British, Rodriguez wore his Quaker outfit much to the delight of the children on the streets who ran after and jeered him, and the consternation of for mer friends, relatives, and especially the local friars. The religious establishment tried to have him expelled, but his British citizenship afforded him the protection he needed. Upon his death, he bequeathed his for tune to the Queen of England, for the benefit of the widows and or phans of British soldiers killed in the Crimean War. His relatives challenged the legitimacy of the will and in itially won their suit. On appeal by the British government, however, the Supreme Court in Madrid reversed the decision by the lower court. The bank was shut down, and Rodriguez’s for tune was eventually paid out to the British. The Quaker had had his revenge. Other financial in stitutions that arose were the Obras Pias and the Banco Español-Filipino. In 1841, all but four confraternities—with their or igins in the late sixteenth century, run by the religious or ders and meant to extend financial assistance to Spaniards—were dissolved, presumably to in crease their efficiency in light of the lower in terest rates of fered by for eign bankers, trading in terests who were only too willing to extend loans to local farmers. The latter had been customarily denied recourse to funds reserved for the Spanish or would be charged usurious rates by the friars. In a pattern that remains to this day, tenant farmers on the huge landed estates of the friar or ders borrowed money at exorbitant rates in or der to work the land and harvest the crops. It was a system almost guaranteed to keep a tenant farmer perpetually in debt, as market prices for their crops were in variably controlled either by middlemen who had ties to the friar or ders, or by the friars the mselves. The for eign merchants provided an alternative which native entrepreneurs eagerly took advantage of. The remaining four confraternities were or dered by Governor General Antonio de Urbiztondo (1850-1853) to amalgamate in 1851 and become Obras Pias. The next year Governor Urbiztondo authorized the founding of the Banco Español-Filipino, which handled the more lucrative aspects of banking, in cluding the right to issue bank notes—previously, Mexican currency had been used—the reby becoming the de facto government bank of the colony. Realizing that favoring Spanish merchants over Filipinos deprived them of a potentially larger market, Banco Español-Filipino adopted the more liberal practices of its for eign competitors. In 1912, in keeping with the new colonial dispensation, the bank renamed itself as the Bank of the Philippine Islands, a venerable in stitution that continues to this day. Despite its awareness of the need to keep up with modern business and trading practices, the government in Manila dragged its feet in in stituting needed reforms. Partly in response to pressure applied by traders, a Tribunal of Commerce was established in 1834, later transformed in 1835 into the Chamber of Commerce, which was charged with impartially adjudicating disputes within the business community. But like other colonial in stitutions, it was just as susceptible to in fluence peddling as any other agency, and rarely accomplished anything worthy of note. Such bureaucratic hurdles discouraged for eign traders from in vesting in the Philippines, with many lured to trade in China, which, mainly controlled by the British, had more liberal laws.

N ATIVE R ESISTANCE: M ERCENARIES, C ONSCRIPTS, AND R EBELS The Filipinos as colonial subjects bore most of the burden of a rule that the or etically was meant to benefit them. They were thus on the frontlines, whether on expeditionary trips to Borneo and the Moluccas, or fighting the Dutch and the English on the high seas, or providing most of the labor on the galleons that plied the Manila-Acapulco route. In the early seventeenth century the Christianized Filipinos fought their non-Christian brothers in campaigns against Mindanao and Jolo, as well as putting down, of ten savagely, Chinese uprisings. The earliest revolt came shortly after the Spanish had made Manila the seat of their still-shaky state, at a time when Limahong was threatening to destroy the city. As described earlier, Rajahs Lakandula and Suleiman (rulers respectively of Tondo and Maynila) felt their prerogatives had been slighted by the Spanish, but De Salcedo appeased them enough so that the two rulers added their for ces to the corps of Manila’s defenders. Limahong was thus defeated. The imposition of colonial rule was rarely, if ever, smooth, with the in digenous populations in many communities resisting the curtailment of their traditional customs and liberties. Additionally, the obligation to pay tribute and render personal services—wartime duty, the building of ships, etc.—seriously limited their efforts to earn a living, necessary in the first place to pay the tribute, creating a vicious circle that seemed impossible to break. In the main, the locals were seen as another natural resource to be exploited, whether this was to in crease the tally of souls saved, which the in dustrious friars kept tabs on, or to provide for a Spaniard’s living. (The understandable reluctance of the in digenous folk to fulfill the demands of corvée would engender stereotypical portrayals of the Filipino as being naturally in dolent—another reason advanced for the upliftment provided by colonial rule.) Abolition of the tribute and corvée were the main demands echoed by almost all uprisings throughout Spanish colonization. From 1574 to the close of the seventeenth century, the Spanish colonial state had to put out fires of varying in tensity, while dealing with external threats from rival European powers. Between 1574 and 1661, there were at least eight significant revolts. We have noted resistance of fered by Suleiman and Lakandula. A decade later, in 1584, Agustin de Legazpi, a Christianized prominent citizen of Tondo, the ancient town that abutted Manila, or ganized a clandestine separatist movement—the first in stance in the Spanish colonial period, and for erunner of the revolutionary movement that would erupt three hundred years later. Even with arms smuggled in by a sympathetic Japanese sea captain, the conspiracy was foiled, and de Legazpi and seven others were executed, in cluding Magat Salamat, datu of Tondo. Fifteen others were deported to Mexico. Uprisings occurred in various regions of the islands, in dicating widespread dissatisfaction with Spanish colonial rule. Simultaneous though uncoordinated revolts by Bankaw in Leyte and Tamblot in Bohol in 1621 were to protest the imposition of a new faith, each leader wanting a restoration of traditional beliefs and practices. The very fact of their non-Christian appellations in dicated either a refusal to be baptized or a discarding of their baptismal names. From 1649 to 1661, failed uprisings occurred in Samar, Pangasinan, Pampanga, and the Ilocos region. With no alliances beyond the particular barangay in volved, these revolts were easily and bloodily suppressed. During the first half of the seventeenth century, wars against the Dutch and military expeditions against the Muslims in the south strained the material and human resources of the Spanish colonists. As a result, abuses on the part of colonial of ficials, if not condoned, were overlooked for pragmatic reasons. In turn, such abuses generated resistance that took various forms depending on how or ganized a settlement was. Dagohoy’s Republic The longest uprising during the Spanish colonial period took place on Bohol and was led by a cabeza de barangay, or barangay chief, Francisco Dagohoy. From 1744 to 1829—an astounding eighty-four years—Dagohoy and his followers numbering in the thousands lived in self-sufficient farming communities they had built in the mountainous in terior of the island, for all in tents and purposes declaring in dependence from Spanish sovereignty. By all accounts an upstanding citizen who had until 1744 recognized the authority of both the church and the state, Dagohoy was in censed when the Jesuit curate of the town of Inabanga, Fr. Gaspar Morales, refused Dagohoy’s brother, Sagarino, a Catholic burial. Sagarino, working for the town as a policeman, had been killed in an encounter with a fugitive, a for mer Christian turned apostate—a crime in those days. The Jesuit’s reason for denying Sagarino a Christian burial was that his death had been occasioned by a duel, which the church for bade. Understandably this refusal didn’t sit well with Dagohoy, who, sworn to revenge, killed Fr. Morales. Another Jesuit curate in a nearby town was killed as well. Dagohoy led three thousand Boholanos to quit their pueblos and join him in setting up communities in the mountains. Dagohoy’s following swelled to as many as twenty thousand over the years. Clearly, refusal of a Christian burial to his brother was the last straw, and emblematic of longer held grievances, the main one being the dreaded corvée. The charismatic Dagohoy would not have had such a large following had the rebels not already harbored their own festering resentments"

The charismatic Dagohoy would not have had such a large following had the rebels not already harbored their own festering resentments. While Dagohoy and his followers observed the rites of Catholicism, such as baptism, and remained steadfast Catholics—though apparently with out the services of or dained curates—they also emphasized the traditions of bayanihan, the reby eliminating tribute and for ced labor. Best of all, the oppressive representatives and symbols of Spanish rule—the ubiquitous padre, the local militia, and the petty town of ficials—were absent. Life was so much better now for Dagohoy and his followers. In effect, they had become what the Spanish termed remontados —literally, “those who remount,” i. e., take to their horses and leave the Spanish-controlled barangays, or people who had chosen to live outside the jurisdiction of the colonial state. Hampering the Spanish authorities’ campaign to subdue the rebels were the well-entrenched positions and for tifications the latter had erected in their mountain lairs. Additionally, sympathizers provided them both supplies and in for mation regarding possible Spanish at tacks. In the meantime, the Seven Years’ War (1756 to 1763) had broken out in Europe. A global conflict that in volved not only Europe but the New World (where it was known as the French and Indian War), Asia, and Africa, it was a battle between two colonial powers, France and England, with France losing most of its North American possessions as a consequence. With the Bourbon- descended Charles III of Spain allied with France, in 1759, a British military expedition or ganized by the British East India Company sailed to Manila from India. The in vasion took the defenders of Intramuros completely by surprise, leading to an easy takeover in late 1762. Having to or ganize resistance outside of Manila, especially in northern Luzon, the Spanish and Filipino loyalist for ces led by Simón de Anda, had their hands full. Dagohoy could wait. By then, Britain was in the vanguard of the in dustrial revolution, its far-flung empire grown muscular and a source of tremendous wealth. The Bourbon- controlled Spanish empire, in contrast, was flaccid, in decline, and its speedy defeat by the British symbolized the latter’s ascendant hegemony. After the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, the British with drew, and the Spanish flag flew once more over Intramuros. Unsuccess ful at tempts were made either to negotiate with or to subdue Dagohoy and his followers. In 1827, a force of 2,200 native and Spanish troops was sent against them, and again in 1828, but these campaigns failed. But by August 31, 1829, the Spanish had crushed the rebellion, taking a year of repeated assaults to do so. By then, Dagohoy had been dead, though no record survives of when and how he died. Three thousand Boholanos’s escaped to other islands, 395 died in battle, 19,420 surrendered, and 98 were exiled. Only in Muslim Mindanao was resistance to Spanish rule longer than the Boholanos’ eighty-five years, a rebellion that lasted through the tenure of twenty Spanish governors general. The Silang Revolt In northern Luzon, the local populations in Pangasinan and Ilocos took advantage of the turmoil brought about by the British in vasion to advocate violently for reforms and try to shake off Spanish repression. The Pangasinan revolt began in late 1762 and was headed by Juan de la Cruz Palaris. It was put down in March of 1764, and its principal leaders executed. The more notable uprising was north of Pangasinan, in the Ilocos region, at that time made up of La Union, Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte. The revolt was headed by thirty- two-year-old Diego Silang, a member of the principalia, who, or phaned at an early age, had been brought up by a parish priest in Vigan. He married a well-to- do widow and happened to be in Manila awaiting the arrival of a galleon from Mexico when the British occupied the city. With the British takeover shattering the myth of Spanish in vincibility, and encouraged by the uprising in Pangasinan—though no effort seemed to have been made to wards joining for ces—Silang and aggrieved Ilocanos demanded the elimination of the polos y servicios, and the expulsion of Spanish mestizos. A mini-civil war erupted between those agitating for reforms and those loyal to the Spanish. Silang gained the upper hand in the southern part of the region. Prior to this revolt, Silang had already been in the vanguard of protesting, in Vigan, against the abuses of the governor (the alcalde mayor ) and demanding the dismissal of some local of ficials. His demands, unacceptable though they were to the Spaniards, were nevertheless reformist rather than radical. Seeking the protection of the British as well as to trade with them, Silang sent communiqués to the British in Manila, and the latter responded by appointing him Sargente Mayor, Alcalde Mayor, and Captain in the War for his British Majesty. Though it was doubtful the British meant more than to flatter Silang, the latter, who seemed to have messianic tendencies, would have welcomed such titles. He declared Christ to be the Captain General, with him as second-in-command. Making Vigan his capital, he abolished tribute and for ced labor, expelled the Spanish, and confiscated the wealth of the church. But Silang’s triumph was momentary. With the encouragement and blessing of both the local bishop and the Manila ecclesiastical authorities, Silang was assassinated by a Spanish mestizo, Miguel Vicos. Silang’s widow, Gabriela, along with his uncle, Nicolas Cariño, took over, seeking refuge in the mountains and directing the uprising for another four months. But the northern region remained loyal and, with reinforcements from the outside, defeated the anti- Spanish for ces. In late 1763, Gabriela and ninety others were captured and hanged"

Resistance in Religious Garb Four years after the departure of the Redcoats, the Jesuits were expelled by royal decree in 1768, for cing them to abandon 114 missions and some schools. The Jesuits had arrived in the Philippines in 1581 and were assigned the Diocese of Cebu, which encompassed parts of northwestern Mindanao. They also took over a seminary in Manila, which became the Colegio de San José, the first college in the islands. (Twenty years later, in 1611, the Dominicans founded present-day University of Santo Tomás, the Catholic University of the Philippines, an in stitution older than Harvard, which was founded in 1636.) Their expulsion came about because the monarchical governments in France, Portugal, and Spain had grown wary of the Jesuits’ education of the colonized, which was in terpreted as empowering them, and the refore undermining colonial rule. The Archbishop of Manila at the time, Sancho Santa Justa, had or dained Filipino seminarians assigned to these parishes, speeding along the Filipinization of the clergy—an unwelcome development as far as the Spanish friars were concerned. At the same time, the friars were opposed to or exceedingly reluctant to grant diocesan visitations, the normal prerogative of the archdiocesan bishop when it came to secular clergy. Since the or ders already had their own superiors, the friars resented this additional layer of authority. Besides, it could lead to a further secularization of the parishes—and a diminution of friar power. In the Philippines, this was more significantly a racial matter, since the friars were peninsulares, or clergy born in Spain, while the secular clergy were in sulares, or Philippine-born priests. By rejecting the right of visitation, the friars were in directly repudiating royal oversight, as it was the Crown that determined appointments to bishoprics, and the bishops determined who staffed the parishes. Both issues—the appointment of native clerics to parishes and regulatory power from outside their friar estates—highlighted how these religious groups jealously guarded their hard-earned (and highly lucrative) preeminent role in the everyday lives of the Filipinos. Theoretically subordinate to the Crown, the friar estates in fact of ten held more power than the colonial regime. By the late eighteenth century it was all but impossible to remove Spanish friars as parish priests. In 1804 they came under the jurisdiction of a vicar-general based, not in Rome, but in Spain—adding another layer of in sulation from the civil government and from the local diocesan bishop. The Jesuits were allowed back in 1859, as authorized by a decree of Queen Isabella II. Re-accommodating them created a domino effect. The Recollects, who had replaced the Jesuits or iginally, asked the government for parishes in Cavite, across the bay from Manila. They as well as the Dominicans were assigned parishes in 1862, at the expense of native-born clergy who held these aforementioned posts. In this manner, Antipolo, a site of pilgrimage and one of the richest parishes in the country, was taken out of the hands of the in sulares and entrusted to the peninsulares. The native clergy rightly saw this as a government strategy to severely circumscribe their role. By then, the only colonies remaining in the once-great Spanish Empire were Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas. Given that Mexican creoles of Filipino descent had fought in the populist army headed by a priest, Fr. Miguel Hildalgo, who launched the war of in dependence against Spain in 1810, the colonial authorities were determined that the virus of nationalism would not be spread by sympathetic native priests. In fact, just before the British in vaded the islands in 1762, there had been a Manila-born secular priest, Don Miguel Lino de Ezpeleta, who, having become the Arch bishop of Cebu, went on to claim the See of Manila and the governor generalship—both positions having been vacant simultaneously—to the dismay of the Real Audiencia. When that august body asked the good archbishop for his authority, Ezpeleta pointed to the troops he had summoned to surround the building where they were meeting. Nevertheless, when the replacement Manuel Rojo arrived from Spain, Ezpeleta stepped aside after an in tense period of negotiations. Ezpeleta was the first and last Filipino governor general under Spanish rule. Secular clergy, under the leadership of native-born Fr. Pedro Pelaez, spoke out against their unjust displacement. They raised funds to send an emissary to Madrid to plead their case, and Fr. Pelaez wrote two tracts in defense of the native clergy. A vigorous and articulate champion, the priest sadly perished, buried under the ruins of the Manila Cathedral as it was flattened by the earthquake of 1863. The denouement in this struggle of the native clergy to be accorded equal rights would come barely a decade later, in the aftermath of the 1872 Cavite Mutiny, its principal actor Fr. José Burgos, who had replaced Pelaez as canon of the cathedral. By the close of the eighteeenth century, the Catholic faith was firmly entrenched, the result of two-and-a-half centuries of assiduous proselytizing by the missionaries and the secular clergy.

This did not mean, however, that these articles of faith brought over from Europe had completely supplanted pre- conquest beliefs and practices. In his Estadismo de las Islas Filipinas ( The Condition of the Philippine Islands ) Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, an Augustinian who served as parish priest in the islands just before the start of the nineteenth century, noted the persistence of what the Catholic Church dismissed as “superstitions.” These in cluded the continuing use of ritualistic practices in the burial of the dead and in dealing with their spirits; and the reliance, still, on amulets, or anting-anting to ward off demonic spirits and phantasmagoric creatures such as the Tikbalang, a monster that took various guises, and the Patianak, a mischievous figure that victimized pregnant women. The locals, according to Zúñiga, still clung to old beliefs in animist spirits, or nonos. Their at titudes implied a healthy respect for nature and the environment. Thus, “when they wish to pluck any flower or fruit, they ask permission of the genius or nono to pluck it. When they traverse any field, river, creek, big trees, groves, and other places, they ask for the good favor of the nonos. When they are obliged to cut any tree, they ask pardon of the nonos, and excuse the mselves to those things by saying, among other things, that the Padre or dered them to do it, and that it was not in their own purpose to fail in their respect to the genii, etc.” Zúñiga also noted the flourishing of the nayon, or barrio, outside the main population areas, where small groups of in habitants had enough to sustain the mselves sans extravagance, lived in a spirit of cooperation and harmony ( bayanihan ), and usually had a village elder to shape communal policies and adjudicate conflicts. In the nayon, life was a hybrid, an amalgam of traditional and Hispanicized mores. Its in habitant was liberated from the in sistent dogma of the priest and the church, free to construct a syncretic, personalized belief system. It was a rebellion, sans violence, sans fanfare, neither accepting colonial rule completely nor rejecting it outright. A modern counterpart to the colonial nayon can be found in peaceful, agrarian, religious communities living on the slopes of Mt. Banahaw, in the southern Tagalog region not too far from Manila and considered to be a sacred mountain. There, combining elements of Christianity and folklore, the deification of local heroes, particularly José Rizal (whose life will be examined in the next chapter), and the recentering of the female as a spiritual force, homegrown cults live amicably side by side, free of the proselytizing and dogmatic fever of the larger, or ganized religions. T HE C RESCENT A GAINST THE C ROSS While the spread of Islam throughout the archipelago was halted by the arrival of the Spanish, they were unable to dominate most of Muslim Mindanao until the last two decades of the nineteenth century, and only then as an occupation force. The situation was the reverse of that in Spain. Islam was an older presence in Southeast Asia, with Christianity the new kid on the block. On the Iberian peninsula, it was of course the exact opposite. The Moors had conquered most of Spain and held on to the peninsula for 700 years, until they were finally driven out by the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, with the reconquest of the last Moorish stronghold, Granada, in 1492. By melding religious zeal with nationalistic fervor, Ferdinand and Isabella had created a powerful and heady quasi-ideology. After the Reconquista, zealotry was the or der of the day, spurring the Spaniards to both colonize and Christianize South and Central America and islands in the Caribbean and in Southeast Asia. The most telling manifestation of that zealotry was the Spanish Inquisition, promulgated by Ferdinand and Isabella, who used Catholicism as an in strument of national solidarity, for cing the conversion of Jews, for in stance, to Christianity and otherwise expelling non-believers and persecuting and even putting to death alleged heretics. Its most in famous advocate was Tomás de Torquemada, who was appointed Inquisitor General in 1483, held the post for fifteen years, and is believed to have had 2,000 people put to death for alleged crimes against the faith. Because of Islam, different ethnolinguistic groups in Mindanao and Sulu, mainly the Maranao, Tausug, and Maguindanao, had the most developed social or ganization. With more pronounced social stratifications, economic and religious contacts with fellow Muslims in Southeast Asia, and the ability to forge alliances, Muslim Mindanao could and did of fer stronger, more or ganized, and determined resistance to Spanish claims to their territory. Had Legazpi not appeared on the horizon, or even if he did but later on—say, at the beginning of the seventeenth century—most of the archipelago might very well have already come under the Crescent, whether as an in dependent state, a conglomeration of sultanates, or in corporated into either Indonesia or Malaysia. The fact that the Muslims resisted Spanish domination is a source of pride for modern-day Filipino nationalists, though the notion then of defending a Philippine nation-state was in conceivable. Still, the Muslim raids on Luzon and the Visayas can be viewed, at the same time that the Spanish portrayed them as piratical, as both retaliation and resistance to colonialism. But there were other factors that contributed to their freedom from Spanish rule. For one thing, Manila and Luzon were front and center the focus of Spanish at tention. For another, the Spaniards had to fend off threats from rival powers such as the Dutch and the Portuguese (and later the British), as well as putting down uprisings in the areas under their control, hobbling their efforts to assemble a large enough force to dominate the Muslims"

Commercial in terests were another factor in the in tense rivalry between the Spanish and the Muslim Filipinos, particularly those of the Sulu Sultanate. With China, defeated by Great Britain in 1842 at the conclusion of the First Opium War, being for ced to open up to Western trade, the sultanate developed into a vital trading center due to its strategic location and rich natural resources—the for tuitous combination of which made the sultanate a powerful player in the region. Jolo, the capital of Sulu, traded with various Asian ports, in cluding Bengal, Canton, Macao, Manila, Borneo, and Singapore. Between 1768 and 1848 the sultanate enjoyed an ascendancy that Manila simultaneously resented and utilized for its own commercial in terests. Such goods from Jolo as pearls, to rtoise shell, shark’s fin, bird’s nest, cinnamon, rattan, ebony, cocoa, and cinnamon—produce of the sea and the for ests—were prized by English traders due to the demand in China for such products. The rise to power of the Taosug (the dominant ethnic group in Sulu) in turn meant their importation of weapons, rice, Chinese ceramics and earthenware, silk clothing, to bacco, wine, glassware, and even opium from India. Luxury goods reinforced elite status and were used to in duce loyalty as well as for bride purchases. Sulu’s control of the regional trade—in what the historian James Francis Warren described as the “Sulu Zone”—enabled the sultanate not only to hold on to its sovereignty but assert its regional dominance until the closing decades of the nineteenth century, when, Warren writes, “the Spanish naval campaigns of the 1870 s and the large-scale immigration of Straits Chinese provided the for mula for the economic and political collapse of the Sulu trading sphere.” The Sultanate’s primacy rested a great deal on its slave raiding traditions, traditions that had always been a feature of the chiefly kingdoms in the archipelago but now in tensified in the case of the sultanate with the need for more manpower, whether in the fields, seas, or in the port, where educated slaves would handle the books and manage the local elites’ business affairs—in the process, a number of them amassing considerable wealth and essentially living as freemen. In this system trade and slavery for med a circle: trade created considerable wealth and power while slavery provided the necessary labor to keep the machinery of trade well oiled. Thus, as trade expanded, so did slave raiding expeditions. Sponsored by the sultanates of both Cotabato and Sulu (with Jolo as the focal point), the raids bedeviled the rest of the archipelago, especially the Visayan Islands, and the coastal to wns of northeastern Mindanao and southern Luzon. The economic and social costs were enormous, ranging from depopulated villages to the disruption of in terisland shipping, particularly in the Visayas. Some of the slave-raiding fleets were enormous, consisting of forty to fifty for tified prahus (similar to the outrigger boat but with a heavier and deeper hull), around 2,500 to 3,000 fighters (mostly Moros from the Maranao or Cotabato region, and the Balangigi isles), and cannon. Slaves were trafficked to Dutch and Bornean ports as well as to Jolo. Captives could be ransomed, with a captured Spanish friar at the top of the list: he commanded the royal sum of 2,000 pesos, while an or dinary European fetched only 300 pesos and a male Filipino slave a measly thirty to fifty pesos. There were periodic military campaigns waged against the Moros, but victory by arms was rarely followed by sustained occupation on the ground. The gains were thus temporary. For in stance, even though a Spanish contingent that in cluded Christian Filipinos assaulted Jolo in 1578 and defeated its sultan, he and his followers were able to rebuild once the Spanish with drew. From then on, Muslim raids on coastal to wns in the Visayas took on a punitive as well as acquisitive character. Later, in 1635, to help defend against such raids the Spanish erected a for tified settlement, Zamboanga, in northwestern Mindanao, where to day Fort del Pilar still stands. With Zamboanga as his base, Governor Corcuera headed a full-scale expedition against the Moros in February 1637. His force of 760 Spaniards and thousands of Christian Filipinos captured Lanao and, the following year, took Jolo after a protracted siege of three and a half months. Convinced that he had broken Muslim power, Corcuera returned to Manila in May 1638 where he was hailed as a conqueror. In truth, for most of the Spanish colonial era, the Moros were never subjugated even in the light of such defeats. They would regroup, and the cycle of conflict would begin anew, essentially affirming the status quo, except for short-lived treaties between the sultanates and the Spanish regime. The Spanish were too few, and faced too many threats from elsewhere. Instead they relied on a network of forts, watchtowers, and warships to guard against Muslim depredations. Watchtowers were of ten strategically located right by the town church so that bells could be rung in warning should Muslim prahus be sighted. There were watchtowers as far north as Laoag and Aparri in northern Luzon, but none on the eastern flanks of the archipelago, though the Pacific side did have occasional patrols. By 1848 the Spanish had grown weary of English encroachment on its southern territories—or what it considered its territories, though the Muslims would have violently disagreed. Mistrust of their perennial rivals was only heightened in 1849 with a treaty of commerce and friendship between Sultan Mohammed Fadl of Sulu and the British government.

      "cultural_golden_answer": "In 1875, the Spanish colonial government launched a significant military campaign against Jolo, which marked a turning point in their struggle to assert control over the Sultanate of Sulu. This event highlights the long-standing conflict between the Spanish colonizers and the Moros, which has its roots in the cultural and historical context of the Philippines. The complex dynamics between the two groups continue to shape the country's identity and inform its relationships with other nations today.",

Mistrust of their perennial rivals was only heightened in 1849 with a treaty of commerce and friendship between Sultan Mohammed Fadl of Sulu and the British government. This time, Manila decided to cripple the Sultanate’s base. Under Governor General Antonio Urbiztondo and with for tified Zamboanga as its launching pad, a flotilla of steam gunboats as well as sailing ships, close to 3,000 soldiers, and nearly a thousand Filipino conscripts, set out for Jolo in 1851. Fighting was fierce but not prolonged. The steam gunboats made short work of the Moro prahus. In the end, the sultan and his datus retreated into the island’s rugged in terior. Shortly the reafter, a treaty was struck, wherein Sultan Fadl acknowledged Spain’s hegemony, agreed to severe restrictions on for eign trade, and allowed a Spanish naval presence in Jolo, to in terdict for eign vessels and prevent or minimize the importation of weapons. But the treaty was doomed, since neither side really observed its provisos. Urbiztondo had failed to establish a garrison in the capital. Hence, the sultanate continued to trade as before. Only in 1875 did the situation change, when the Spanish colonial government launched a much larger war fleet: nine thousand soldiers (a majority of whom were Filipinos), eleven transport ships, and twenty-two gunboats. In late February, the Spanish flattened Jolo and destroyed nearby Taosug strongholds in the following weeks. This time, a Spanish occupation force remained, erecting forts and rebuilding Jolo, as a European-style city complete with a wall. It was only in 1899 that the Spanish departed, giving way to the new plantation owners: the United States of America. The fact that Christianized natives were regularly employed in the campaigns against the Moros, who were considered beyond the pale, did little to endear them to the latter. Not surprisingly, they subsequently viewed each other with mutual suspicion. Despite racial and cultural ties, each to each was the Other: for eign and hostile—an animosity that persists to this day and complicates efforts to negotiate a lasting peace on both sides of the religious and cultural divide."

THE REPUBLIC: PERILS OF INDEPENDENCE, 1946-1972 “The security in terests of the United States require that the Philippines become and remain stable, anti-communist, pro-American, and an example for the rest of the world of the in tention of the United States to encourage the establishment of progressive and responsible governments. This entails the reassertion of U. S. in fluence to the extent required to eliminate prevalent corruption, provide efficient administrative services, and restore public faith in the concept of government in the best in terests of the people…. [The United States should] continue to assume responsibility for the external defense of the Islands and be prepared to commit United States for ces, if necessary, to prevent Communist control of the Philippines.” —U. S. National Security Report, November 10, 1950 T HE I MMEDIATE A FTERMATH OF THE W AR T HE BLOODY CAMPAIGN TO WREST THE P HILIPPINES AWAY FROM the Japanese left the country in ruins, with the archipelago facing the seemingly in surmountable task of rebuilding. Manila was a shell of its pre-war grandeur, its heart, Intramuros, gutted. In an in itial estimate of the damages caused by war, the Philippine Bureau of Census and Statistics put these at close to $3 billion. Later the Philippines would file claims on the Japanese government for $4 billion. Claims from all the countries damaged by the Pacific War to taled $54 billion, an enormous amount that Japan would find all but impossible to pay. The Allied reparations committee, however, could not agree on the amount Japan could pay. In the in terim, the U. S. government authorized Mac Arthur, virtual emperor of Japan during the U. S. occupation, to compel the Japanese to make payments. Most of these in terim payments were in the form of in dustrial equipment. Additionally, Japanese assets in the different countries could be seized by their respective governments. However, in 1949, the U. S. unilaterally dropped its demands for payments, but the Philippines and other war-damaged countries objected. In light of ideological battle lines being drawn between the Soviet Union and the U. S., Japan was now seen as a vital cornerstone in Asia against the Soviet Union. Its economic recovery, unhampered by reparations, was crucial. In 1952, Japan signed a peace treaty with forty-nine nations, in cluding the United States. The treaty provided that Japan would negotiate separately with not just the Philippines but other war-damaged countries such as Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand. Four years later, Japan and the Philippines agreed to a reparations program wherein Japan would provide $500 million in free goods over a ten- year period; $30 million in technical services; $20 million in payments to war widows and or phans; and $250 million in long-term loans over a period of twenty years, to end in 1977. From the Japanese perspective, the reparations process would help reopen markets heretofore closed to them, and thus gain access to much-needed raw materials. While Osmeña was nominally the president of the commonwealth, Douglas Mac Arthur, as commander of the U. S. for ces, called the shots. He had at his disposal men, money, and materials, and he used them strategically to once again in sure firm U. S. control before Philippine in dependence would be declared on July 4, 1946. To do that, and to get a government up and running as soon as possible, he and his staff overlooked potential charges of collaboration against those of the political elite who had worked with the Japanese. Mac Arthur was especially keen on Manuel Roxas, his aide before the war and whom he much preferred to the fastidious and more in dependent-minded Osmeña, who had succeeded Quezon as president of the commonwealth when the latter died of chronic tuberculosis at Lake Saranac, New York, in August of 1944. Roxas’s star had risen fast in the pre-war political firmament: a politician from Capiz Province in the Visayas, he occupied the speakership of the Philippine Assembly in 1922 at the age of thirty. He worked with Osmeña on the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill, and later became secretary of finance under Quezon, becoming his trusted personal adviser. He was elected senator in 1941 and the outbreak of World War II saw him as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). He was captured by the Japanese in Mindanao in 1942, and he subsequently served in the puppet government set up by the Japanese, as the chair of the Economic Planning Board. Towards the end of the war, he escaped or was released by the Japanese High Command headed by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had, along with the cabinet, fled to the mountain resort city of Baguio in the north. Mac Arthur pushed for early presidential elections. But Roxas couldn’t very well run as the standard bearer of the Nacionalistas, since Osmeña, the party leader, was running for the presidency as well. Roxas thus broke away and founded the Liberal Party in January of 1946, making it the second-oldest political party in the country. The Nacionalistas Party had been around since 1907 when it was founded, and it dominated the political scene until the outbreak of World War II. Arguments were made that a two-party system was imperative for a democracy to flourish. Nonetheless it was the pursuit of personal ambition that motivated Roxas, thus setting a precedent regularly followed by those whose own ambitions were stymied by their party. Each party’s platforms were strikingly similar, and voters were asked to heed the call of one rather than the other not because of ideological differences, but because, pledged to the same ends, one party could achieve these more effectively than the other. In short, no major differences characterized the Nacionalistas from the Liberals and postwar party politics became almost exclusively personal politics. With the implicit view that governance was primarily for the benefit of those in power, the system encouraged personal and in dividual rather than party loyalty, with turncoats rewarded rather than punished. Short-term in terests in variably prevailed over long-term ones. The left threw its support behind Osmeña, viewing Roxas with deep suspicion due to his wartime collaboration with the Japanese as a high of ficial in the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic. The fact that General Mac Arthur cleared him of treason—in unseemly haste, it seemed to Mac Arthur’s critics— only added fuel to the fire. Collaboration between Filipinos and the Japanese proved to be a more complicated issue than or iginally thought. Osmeña emphasized that the whole matter had to be examined judiciously, with out a rush to judgment that would view all those who worked with and for the Japanese at different levels and capacities in the same treasonous light. Civil servants for example had to keep on working, to in sure the everyday workings of government, which was not necessarily true of politicians"

Civil servants for example had to keep on working, to in sure the everyday workings of government, which was not necessarily true of politicians. Rebuilding meant not only physical rehabilitation and the resuscitation of a moribund economy, but settling the issue of collaboration. Given that a significant number of the ruling elite had worked with the Japanese, many of whom were known, if not close, to General Mac Arthur, this issue was political dynamite. With the government in Washington in itially desirous that those accused be tried for collaboration, a People’s Court was in stituted precisely for this, but it was doomed from the start. For one thing, only fifteen judges were on hand to try 5,603 cases. It was a virtually impossible task. Moreover, twenty-five government prosecutors were permitted only six months to argue all the cases. For another, Mac Arthur had preemptively exonerated Manuel Roxas, a pre-war friend. While the matter of collaboration was still being discussed, the commonwealth government held elections in April of 1946, with Roxas and Quirino vying against Osmeña and Eulogio Rodriguez, and winning. Sixteen senators were also elected, along with ninety-eight congressmen, the full slate of the House of Representatives. While Roxas’s Liberal Party dominated, seven senators were from the opposition as were thirty-eight of the ninety-eight congressmen. Three months later, on July 4, 1946, in dependence-day rituals were held at the Luneta, not far from the historic Manila Hotel and the U. S. Army and Navy Club, and fronting Manila Bay where in 1898 Spanish gunboats were easily defeated. The United States relinquished its titular and tutelary hold on the country choosing the same date of its own in dependence to do so. The Stars and Stripes was lowered, and the Philippine flag, with its golden-rayed sun, raised in its place. The population of a still bleeding nation stood at 18 million. With Roxas and Quirino as its president and vice president respectively, the Republic of the Philippines was finally in dependent of the United States, its colonial master the past half-century. But was it truly in dependent? Having its own flag fly over the nation did not automatically mean the United States had relinquished control over these Southeast Asian islands, only that the means of control had become less overt. Rather than a clean, selfless hand-off— which was what had been promised—that day marked the transition of a colony to a neo-colony, similar to what befell Cuba at the end of the Spanish-American War. The status of the Philippines was closer to what the unlamented Federalistas (the country’s earliest political party, established in 1900) desired. The Federalistas had quickly acknowledged American sovereignty even as the Philippine-American War was raging and campaigned for an autonomous government along the lines of a protectorate. After a certain amount of time had passed, the party had planned to campaign for statehood rather than in dependence. Half a century later, the country’s status had come full circle. By winning the presidency and vice-presidency of the Commonwealth in April of 1946, Roxas and his running mate, Elpidio Quirino, under the banner of the Liberal Party, effectively ended Osmeña’s political career. The tandem presided over the transference of sovereignty from the United States to the newly for med republic on July 4, 1946. Roxas and Quirino were thus the last president and vice president of the commonwealth, and the first president and vice president under the postcolonial dispensation. Roxas didn’t serve out the full four-year term, however, as he died of a heart at tack while giving a speech in 1948 at Clark Air Force Base. It was only fitting that the unabashedly pro-U. S. Roxas passed away on American ground. Earlier that year, as expected, he had granted amnesty to all collaborators. There had been 5,603 cases filed, but only 156 had resulted in convictions, with only one relatively prominent figure convicted. The aftermath of the war of fered unparalleled opportunities to remake Philippine society economically and socially. But Douglas Mac Arthur was too close to the pre-war Philippine elite to in itiate any far-reaching reforms. As ment ioned in the previous chapter, the half-million dollar gift from President Quezon just before Mac Arthur had left the islands in 1942 was emblematic of such ties. The pre-war status quo was what the conservatives wanted, and it was what they got. In contrast, as commander of Occupied Japan, from 1945 to 1951, Mac Arthur and his staff in troduced land reform, helped break up the zaibatsu (the monopolistic in dustrial combines), and drafted labor laws, among other elements of change. Mac Arthur could afford to be dispassionate in his role as military ruler, an American shogun in Japan, having no personal or professional ties with Japan’s ruling elite. However, he did exonerate Emperor Hirohito and the rest of the imperial family for any responsibility for the war. He also accorded immunity to the Japanese bacteriological research units in exchange for data based on gruesome human experiments. That the United States was less altruistic with the Philippines can be seen in the number of strings it at tached to the for mal cessation of colonial rule. The new republic, having suffered a horrific three-and-a-half years of war due to its status as a U. S. colony, was in no position to refuse. Among those strings were economic agreements that favored the U. S. and a 99-year bases lease that placed significant chunks of Philippine territory under U. S. suzerainty. In the in terim President Harry Truman had decided to leave the issue of collaboration up to the civil authorities in Manila, ostensibly to display trust in the Philippine government to do the right thing but it was in effect a policy of appeasement"

In the in terim President Harry Truman had decided to leave the issue of collaboration up to the civil authorities in Manila, ostensibly to display trust in the Philippine government to do the right thing but it was in effect a policy of appeasement. He did so on the recommendation of Mac Arthur, who knew that, despite popular sentiment calling for retribution against those who had worked with the Japanese occupiers, the political establishment would not condemn its own. Any sustained in vestigation into their wartime activities would embarrass and alienate the pre-war elite who were back in the saddle. At the start of 1948, Roxas declared an amnesty for all suspected collaborators, sidestepping the thorny dilemma and effectively curtailing the existence of the People’s Court. The amnesty appeased many of Roxas’s powerful supporters, landlords, and other wealthy and socially prominent in dividuals who were suspected of wartime collaboration. T HE C OLD W AR Why was the politically explosive issue of collaboration allowed to wither away? Quite simply, the Cold War and the perceived threat of Communism emerged as the two most crucial and related issues the United States believed it had to deal with. With ideological fault lines being drawn up globally between the Soviet Union and its allies on one hand and the United States and its allies on the other—between the Free World and the Iron Curtain, in the jargon of the day —Washington’s overriding anti-Communism translated into continued support of the traditional Philippine oligarchy, whose own anti-Communist feelings were beyond reproach if only because this was what was expected of them. Besides, the hardships of World War II and the brutality of Japanese occupation transformed the image of the Americans from colonial oppressors to liberators. Except for the Huks, with their roots in anti-imperialism, most guerrilla groups viewed the Japanese as the only enemy. Harboring doubts that the postwar dispensation would be any kinder to wards their socialist goals, the Huks held on to their arms, ready to use them once more if no substantial reforms were undertaken by the government. Washington was relying on the oligarchy to restore or der, fight Communism, and to assure stable leadership in in dependence, equating stability with democracy. Roxas may have been a collaborator but more importantly this economic expert was anti-Communist and would align the Philippines with the United States. It thus became in creasingly difficult to criticize the establishment with out being thought of as a commie sympathizer. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the need for the ruling establishment’s unconditional support for U. S. Cold War policies meant U. S. authorities conveniently overlooked in stances of corruption. In one notorious case, war surplus property that had been stockpiled for the planned in vasion of Japan and valued at $137 million was to be sold off by a government commission, dominated by Roxas’s Liberal Party, over a period of three years, from 1946 to 1949. At the end of ficial sales tallied only $37 million; the question of where the balance of $100 million went was never satisfactorily answered. According to the American Chamber of Commerce Journal, this “constituted the biggest windfall in Philippine history.” There had been precedents, of course, during the Japanese Occupation, with the black market enabling many an unscrupulous businessman and/or politician to realize vast profits. And so a pattern of corruption was set that permeated the different levels of government bureaucracy, where appropriations for public services and programs, especially in rural areas, were in evitably depleted due to kickbacks and bribes—a pattern that continues to plague the government to this day. Now the enemy as defined by the Cold War was Communism. Washington looked in alarm at the postwar emergence of the Soviet Union as a superpower. At the same time, two developments in mainland Asia provoked further anxiety: the defeat of the Chinese Nationalists headed by Chiang Kai-shek and the establishment in 1949 of a Chinese Communist regime under Mao Tse-tung; and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The Korean War—which is, even in the twenty-first century, unfinished— began in June of 1950, when the army of the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea under Kim Il-sung crossed the 38 th parallel into the Republic of Korea. The war was the culmination of escalating conflicts between the two halves of a country that had been divided right after World War II once it had been freed of Japanese colonial rule, which had begun in 1910. Truman announced that U. S. for ces would be sent to Korea and used this opportunity to or der that aid to France’s colonial war in Indochina be stepped up, that the U. S. Seventh Fleet defend Formosa should Communist China at tack, and that United States for ces in the Philippines be strengthened and military assistance to the Philippine government be accelerated. The Korean War marked the first conflict where Cold War antagonists openly backed one side or the other, thus becoming not just a war to unify the country but a proxy one as well between the two superpowers. The war was also the first time that the United Nations decided to use force— to in tervene on behalf of Syngman Rhee’s South Korea, with the United States leading the way. President Quirino authorized the sending of the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea (PEFTOK) of more than 7,000 troops.

Rather than stopping at the border, Mac Arthur’s for ces undertook in cursions into North Korea. China, feeling that its own security was under threat, responded militarily, sending in its own troops to fight alongside the North Koreans. It was a war of bloody stalemates. Because Mac Arthur had dared publicly rebuke President Truman’s war policies, he was fired. The general had wanted to escalate the war by in vading China and using atom bombs to create a nuclear fallout zone as a barrier. Such tactics would have widened the scope of the war and brought the Soviet Union into the fray—an outcome Truman wished to avoid. An armistice was finally signed on July 27, 1953—an armistice that has never led to a cessation of hostilities, merely their suspension. The Korean War and the French troubles with Ho Chi Minh seemed to exemplify the “domino the ory,” first expounded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in an April 1954 news conference on Indochina: “Finally you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the ‘falling domino’ principle…. You knock over the first ones and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have the beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound in fluence.” U. S. Bases Agreement A crucial element of U. S. Cold War strategy in Asia was the retention of bases in its for mer colony. While General Dwight David Eisenhower had advocated for the with drawal of all U. S. for ces from the Philippines—he believed that positive relations between the two countries overrode the bases’ importance—his was a decidedly minority view. While of ficial rhetoric extolled the “special relationship” between the two countries, with shared goals of promoting the democratic way of life, U. S. policy was decidedly less sentimental, assessing the value of the island nation primarily in relation to Cold War politics. Perhaps no one was more hard-nosed in this regard than the in fluential veteran diplomat and political scientist George Kennan. He was one of the principal architects of U. S. for eign policy during the early stages of the Cold War, arguing for a policy of containment when it came to the Soviet Union and its allies, whom he regarded as expansionist. Kennan was straightforward enough to dispense with platitudes when defining what the of ficial U. S. at titude to wards the Philippines should be. He stated: “We should cease to talk about vague and—for the Far East—unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.” Kennan suggested a hands-off policy when it came to the country’s in ternal affairs, as long as it continued to serve U. S. security needs in Southeast Asia. In a post-World War II planet, the United States was eager to build a network of bases overseas, to maintain U. S. hegemony and serve principally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union and to a lesser extent against newly in dependent for mer colonies that did not necessarily accept the U. S. in terpretation of what a world or der should be. These nations, usually referred to as the Third World, came to be regarded as satellites of one superpower or the other, rarely as in dependent ships of state. Asia, Africa, and Latin America of ten became sites of proxy wars, that is, wars rooted in local causes but in which the superpowers got in volved as a way of advancing their own in terests with out their own boots on the ground. Another term for these sorts of wars was Low Intensity Conflict (LIC)—low in tensity, that is, for the superpower though not for the actual combatants. Thus, the Philippines’ transformation to a neo-colony, with the United States still very much a dominant player in both its in ternal and external affairs. The fact that there were in 1949 in stalled a Communist regime in China, an anti- Communist government in Taiwan, and neutral and possibly leftist governments in both India and Indonesia only made the case for continued U. S. military bases in the region more compelling—from Washington’s perspective. Adding to U. S. anxiety about Communism in the region was a guerrilla war between the Commonwealth for ces in Malaya and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party made up mostly of ethnic Chinese. Like the Huks, the MNLA was an outgrowth of the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army. The conflict, begun in 1948, ended in 1960, with the capitulation of the MNLA. While there was no question that the newly in stalled Roxas administration was in lockstep with the United States, still, talks on the status of U. S. bases in the country dragged on for eight months. To prod along recalcitrant Philippine of ficials, President Truman threatened to with draw all U.

Facilities ranged from Sangley Naval Base in Cavite to Camp John Hay Rest and Recreation Center in Baguio City, from Subic Bay Naval Base (SBNB) in Olongapo, Zambales Province, to Clark Air Force Base (CAFB) in Angeles City, Pampanga Province. Subic and Clark were the largest U. S. bases outside the United States. Clark covered 14.3 square miles, with access to a reservation of 230 square miles, which in cluded the Crow Valley aerial warfare range. What began as the army base Ft. Stotsenburg in 1903 was now the largest American base overseas, bigger than the entire island of Grenada. Outside of Japan and Korea, Clark Air Base was the sole major operational U. S. Air Force in stallation in the far West Pacific, able to handle all aircraft, in cluding the largest military transports. Navy planners considered it a superb logistic-support base, essential to maintaining U. S. combat readiness. Subic Bay, eyed as early as 1572 by Miguel de Legazpi’s grandson, Juan de Salcedo, as an excellent deep-water port, had been developed as an arsenal by the Spanish in 1885. The U. S. Navy began to use it in 1901, and in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated it and about 100,000 acres as a military reservation. The largest naval in stallation outside the U. S., Subic of fered the Seventh Fleet a unique combination of ship, aircraft, and support facilities, with three major wharves, that could berth even the largest aircraft carriers. Additionally, Subic had the largest ship-repair facility in the Western Pacific, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Just as important, labor costs in the Philippines were the lowest available to the U. S. Navy. At the outset, both bases in cluded cities within their jurisdiction: Angeles for Clark, and Olongapo for Subic, though the two cities later on regained their autonomy. The bases agreement prohibited the Philippines from granting base rights to any other country and placed no restriction on the uses to which the U. S. could put the bases, nor the types of weapons that it could deploy or store there. Additionally, the MBA allowed the United States to recruit Filipinos into the U. S. Armed Forces. For close to five decades, the United States was sovereign within the bases, able to use them with fewer restrictions than anywhere else it had bases. A principal function for them of course was as springboards for U. S. in tervention in Asia. Projecting American might—and later, protecting its in terests—in Asia had always been an in tegral part of U. S. design. Prior to World War II, U. S. military units had been dispatched on three occasions from the colony: in 1900, to China, to help crush the Boxer Rebellion; during the Russian civil war in 1918 to 1920, to Siberia; and in 1927, to Shanghai, to help protect the Western expatriate community known as the International Settlement. Corollary to the MBA was the Military Assistance Agreement (MAA) of March 21, 1947. The MAA stipulated that a U. S. military advisory group, known as the Joint U. S. Military Advisory Group, or JUSMAG, be at tached to the Philippine Armed Forces. The agreement also provided for the training of selected Philippine military personnel in the U. S. As with Cuba’s Platt Amendment, the Philippines agreed not to accept military aid or advisers from elsewhere unless Washington consented. With the U. S. bases and military assistance to uted in part as necessary for the defense of the archipelago, the question arose, who exactly were the Philippines’ external enemies? Not being part of continental Asia, the country was secure from land-border in filtration. Furthermore, the country had had no historic or traditional enemies, except those who warred with Spain and later the United States, their for mer colonizers. The only credible threat to the stability of the country and the government would be from within, from its own population, and it was in the domestic arena where U. S. military assistance could be and was of ten utilized. Through such measures, the United States in sured that it would continue to play a dominant role in Philippine political life well beyond July 4, 1946. While such a strategy was anchored in the realpolitik of the Cold War it had its roots in the imperialism that underscored U. S. occupation at the start of the twentieth century. T HE H UK R ESURGENCE The U. S. obsession of containing, at times confronting, Communism globally, cast the Philippines in a new light.

It softened the exploitative system, keeping in check but not quite eradicating discontent. That changed when the in cidence of absentee landlordism grew. In conformity with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the U. S. government had agreed to buy the huge landed estates of the Spanish friars. And it did, in 1903, with funds raised through the sale of Philippine government bonds. In turn, these estates, to taling close to 400,000 acres, were to be sold mainly to the landless. In reality, most of the landless peasants could ill afford to buy the proffered parcels of land. Those who did had no in stitutional support (government or private) to make the transition from tenancy to landowners. In the end, a majority were for ced to sell their small plots to wealthy landowners, to caciques and middle-class elements that had grown during the American occupation. Many if not most of the new landowners chose to continue living in to wns and cities, delegating the task of managing their lands to their managers, an arrangement that of ten led to abuse and more importantly to the breakdown of traditional landlord-tenant relations. Inevitably, the gap between these two social classes grew wider. Moreover, to the tenant farmers and sharecroppers, the political freedoms and sense of emancipation that American colonial rule promised to bring were nowhere in evidence. Coupled with two new bills that threatened to further weaken an already weakened economy—the Philippine Rehabilitation Act (PRA) and the Philippine Trade Act (PTA), to be discussed shortly—the Huks and the PKP felt they had no other option but to take up arms once again, as they had during the war against the Japanese. In this regard, Mac Arthur could have helped defuse the explosive social situation had he pushed for meaningful land reform, as he and Occupation authorities under his command were to do later on in Japan. But the general was too close to the oligarchy to in stitute any deep-seated changes. He had served in the archipelago at the behest of Quezon and had enjoyed rapport with, and the support of, society’s elite. From 1935, when he accepted Quezon’s of fer to build the Philippine army, until the outbreak of the war in 1941, the general and his wife lived in a magnificent penthouse with seven air-conditioned rooms at the luxurious Manila Hotel, fronting Manila Bay and near both the U. S. Embassy and the Army and Navy Club—a neat, roseate triangulation of a colonial world where most natives rarely in truded and then only to serve. The five-star accommodations were considered part of his compensation as a government employee; not only was he accorded the title Field Marshall by Quezon, he was also designated honorary General Manager of the hotel. Clearly, enjoying demigod status, Mac Arthur was not about to bite the hand that had fed him so well while in the Philippines. To in sure the passage of laws meant to preserve the U. S.-favored role in the Philippines, Roxas and the Liberal Party needed to undermine if not sideline the opposition in both chambers of Congress. The Nacionalista Party, having been weakened by Roxas’s defection, had joined for ces with the Democratic Alliance, an anti-collaboration party and among whose leaders were Communists. While the elections went to the Liberals, six Alliance candidates were elected to the House of Representatives. In the Senate three were known to oppose the proposed bills. Before the elected Congress in 1946 were the Philippine Rehabilitation Act (PRA) and the Philippine Trade Act (PTA). The PRA set limits on compensation. The estimated cost of restoration was P 8 billion, or $4 billion. Of this, the PRA would provide a to tal of $1.24 billion, broken down into $620 million to compensate for war-related damages; $100 million worth of army surplus and construction equipment; $120 million for in frastructure and public buildings; and $400 million for in dividuals and businesses that could document losses due to the war. There would also be $200 million for the Philippine Army but with the proviso that benefits for the 200,000 Filipinos who had fought with the U. S. for ces against the Japanese be with drawn—benefits that had been promised by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941. The Rescission Act of 1946, signed into law by President Harry Truman, stipulated that Filipino veterans who had served the U. S. military, either in their capacity as regulars in the Philippine commonwealth army or as guerrillas in units recognized by the U. S. military, should not be deemed to have been in active military, naval, or air service for the purposes of any law of the United States conferring rights, privileges, or benefits upon any person by reason of such service. Of all the countries allied with the United States during the war, only Filipino veterans were denied these benefits. (In 2009, this in justice was partly rectified when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a lump sum of $15,000 for veterans who were U. S. citizens, and $9,000 for non-U. S. citizens. More than sixty years after the war, the number of survivors had dwindled to 15,000.) The PTA, also known as the Bell Trade Act, guaranteed duty-free exports to the U. S. for eight years, after which tariffs would be imposed on a gradual scale until 1974, when Philippine exports would be subject to full tariffs. The PTA also restricted the Philippines from manufacturing goods that could compete with those made in the United States, thus providing U. S. imports an unfair advantage, and stifling the in centive to in dustrialize. The bill’s most blatantly exploitative provision, however, was, the in famous “Parity” provision, which extended to U.

S. in vestors the same rights that Filipino citizens had to develop the country’s resources and to operate public utility companies. Such a provision ran counter to the Con stitutional requirement that sixty percent of corporations for med to develop these natural resources had to be owned by Filipinos. This meant that in reserved areas U. S. citizens could have ownership up to 100 percent, whereas other for eign nationals were limited to 40 percent—effectively discouraging for eign in vestment that was not American. The 1935 Constitution needed to be amended, a process that had to be approved by a majority vote in the legislature. It was made clear to the Roxas administration that this arrangement was a condition for rehabilitation aid. In turn, to make sure that the bills were passed, the Roxas administration through the Liberal Party-dominated Congress refused to seat seven representatives from Central Luzon, and three senators, all of whom had spoken out against parity. The Roxas government drummed up false charges against these legislators, claiming that they had won their respective electoral contests fraudulently and through violence, sidestepping the Electoral Tribunal created precisely to handle these kinds of cases. Even with the purge, however, the amendment to the Constitution barely passed, by a plurality of one vote. One of those denied his seat, pending the outcome of in vestigation into the charges (eventually dismissed), was Senator Ramon Diokno, who had been one of Quezon’s chief campaign strategists. He had this to say: This continuance of American control, however, could not have been achieved with out the solicitous assistance of the Filipinos that now rule our country. The Roxas government, which is headed by collaborators, obviously felt that it could not survive unless it accepted the Trade Act in or der to open the way for American financial and military aid. It needed money not only for material rehabilitation, but for the maintenance of an expensive governmental system…. The Roxas government chose to sacrifice Philippine in dependence for the sake of the advantage to be gained from American political and military support. This decision was not surprising, in asmuch as these were the same Filipinos that had worked readily with the Japanese, and that would have been removed from political and economic in fluence if President Roosevelt’s directive against collaborators had been carried out. Manuel Roxas himself violated his oath as General in the United States Army by advising puppet-president José Laurel to declare war against the United States and its Allies during the Japanese occupation. Luis Taruc, the Huk commander-in-chief of the Hukbalahap, was one of the congressmen unseated. From a peasant family in Pampanga, Taruc dropped out of college and, in fluenced by the in creasing radicalism of the peasantry, joined the PKP at the age of twenty-two. He distinguished himself during the war as a guerrilla fighter against the Japanese. The response of the Huks to this latest drawback was rebellion, met by a crackdown by the Roxas regime. The Huks were able to reorganize easily, and win support. The movement was concentrated mainly in Central Luzon, though it had pockets of support in the Southern Tagalog regions and on Panay Island in the Visayas. The Huks, for ged in the crucible of the war and buoyed by the successful 1949 Chinese Communist victory, emerged as a serious threat to Manila. They had proven to be a for midable foe of the Japanese, engaging them in 1,200 conflicts and killing approximately 25,000 enemy soldiers and those Filipinos believed to have collaborated with them. By war’s end, armed Huks numbered 20,000, with 50,000 in reserve. The thought of a pro-Soviet, pro-China Malacañang in duced sleepless nights in Washington, moving it to in terfere. During the war, the Huks had raised the political consciousness of the peasants even as they positioned the mselves in Central Luzon. By 1944, the Huks controlled significant areas of Central Luzon, anticipating a possible modus vivendi with the American-controlled Common wealth government once the war was over. But the U. S. Army’s Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC), in tandem with the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU), had other ideas, replacing the Huks with pro-American in dividuals, of ten drawn from USAFFE-led guerrilla groups and from the more conservative, upper class echelons of the local society, even if many of the latter had served the Japanese. Thus, where the Huks and their supporters had been in strumental in fighting Japanese rule, they were excluded. They were disarmed as well, and of ten their leaders arrested and the BUDCs dismantled. In at least one case, members of a Huk unit were simply executed. The hardening of ideological lines reflected Cold War realities, with pro-U. S. for ces displaying an unremitting hostility to wards any group professing Communist beliefs. After the war, Taruc and Casto Alejandrino, one of the founders of the Hukbalahap, had been imprisoned briefly by the U. S. military at the Iwahig Penal Colony on Palawan Island. The Solicitor General at the time, however, Lorenzo Tanada (later to become a prominent senator), found no basis for their detention, and the two were released.

For a while, Roxas at tempted a pacification campaign, sending out mixed signals, but in the end, demanding that the Huks surrender all their arms. In a last-ditch effort, the Huk and PKP or ganizations responded with a memo to the president urging that all steps be taken to forge a peaceful resolution, asking, among other things, that private armies—landlord-sponsored and financed, and of ten the flashpoint of physical confrontations—be disbanded, all charges against the Huks for in itiatives taken during the war be dismissed, that the Democratic Alliance congressmen be allowed their seats in Congress, and that civil liberties be restored. The government’s response was to in crease militarization of Central Luzon. Secret or ders were issued for the arrest of Huk top leaders. Warnings went out to them, but failed to reach one in fluential peasant leader, Juan Feleo, who was abducted by men in Military Police uniforms and subsequently murdered. The Huks responded by reconstituting their armed squadrons and renaming the mselves the Hukbong Magpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), or People’s Liberation Army. They engaged both the Military Police and private armies when barrios were raided. Veterans of the war against the Japanese and with a tested or ganizational structure, the Huks usually got the better of government for ces. The Huks renewed the peasantry’s struggle over social issues such as land reform, health care, and decent wages. Initially hesitant to support the Huks—it believed the revolution would begin in the cities—the PKP saw in this agrarian uprising a golden opportunity to seize state power. Thus the revocation of the parity amendment and the with drawal of American military bases were added to the Huk agenda. Both the Huks and the PKP leadership saw how fruitless parliamentary struggle had been. With a restive, disillusioned peasant population of close to two million in Central Luzon, the Huks numbered twelve to fifteen thousand armed fighters. These developments were worrisome not just to Manila but to Washington. Under the 1947 Military Assistance Pact, and through the Joint U. S. Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG), an anti-Huk counterinsurgency campaign was put into place. Roxas died suddenly on April 15, 1948, and Elpidio Quirino took over the presidency. The Odd Couple Quirino granted amnesty to the Huks, but faulty implementation led to its failure. The in surgency resumed. Pressured by the U. S. military and the ambassador, Quirino appointed a young congressman, Ramón Magsaysay, to the post of Secretary of National Defense. Against the backdrop of the Cold War, fearful that the Philippines—a country that the U. S. had to uted as its showcase of democracy in Asia—might turn Communist, as had China in 1949, the U. S. government through the CIA took an in creasingly active role in the counterinsurgency tactics of the AFP. In August Truman had recommended an in crease in aid to the Philippines as well as to Southeast Asia, to combat Communist in fluence and aggression, specifically during the Korean War. Thus, aid in 1951 was four times that of the previous year. Instrumental in setting up the military programs, in cluding psychological war operations, was Air Force Colonel Edward Lansdale, a for mer advertising executive and now CIA covert operations specialist—and the model for Alden Pyle, the young American diplomat in Graham Greene’s The Quiet American, as well as Colonel Hillandale in William Lederer and Eugene Burdick’s The Ugly American. Shortly after Magsaysay’s appointment, Lansdale arrived in Manila and promptly or chestrated the anti-Huk campaign, living out of a suitcase at the defense headquarters, and calling the defense chief “brother”—his younger one, clearly. Under Lansdale’s tutelage, Magsaysay revitalized the Armed Forces of the Philippines, weeding out corrupt and abusive personnel and in stilling a sense of professionalism in the ranks. The tasks he and his soldiers faced were for midable. The Huks were popular not simply because they were the mselves farmers and peasants but because they had taken steps to remedy social in equities. They provided rudimentary but strict and consistent governance, where none had existed. To the disaffected rural poor, the government in distant Manila seemed to care for them only during elections, when for a brief moment the common tao was king and queen. To counter this and no doubt drawing from his advertising expertise, Lansdale put into practice a “hearts-and-minds” strategy, wherein government programs for the welfare of the peasantry were put into place, court cases speeded up, and army units undertook such projects as digging for artesian wells and extending medical care. Too, Magsaysay of ten accompanied the troops on their missions, whether in combat or to visit a remote barrio. He and Lansdale made sure these for ays were covered by the media, so that every photograph of the Secretary of Defense presiding over the surrender of Huks was a particularly effective bullet in the propaganda war, transforming Magsaysay into the common man’s hero. In addition, part of the counterinsurgency success was the government of fer of land in Mindanao for the landless Huk fighter. From 1954 to 1963, the government resettled 20,500 families of the Huks—a resettlement program that decades later would contribute to the conflict between the in digenous Muslim and non- Muslim tribes on one hand, and, on the other, descendants of the or iginal Christian settlers over land rights.

One effective psychological warfare and counterinsurgency tactic Lansdale pioneered was to employ traditional beliefs in aswang, or vampires, to scare the Huks and their peasant sympathizers. Army patrols would ambush a Huk and, through two puncture marks in his neck, drain the corpse of blood, leaving it on a trail. Fellow Huks or villagers discovering the body would then steer clear of the area, fearing the presence of aswang. New York Times correspondent Raymond Bonner, in his book on the Marcos regime, Waltzing with a Dictator, describes how “Lansdale concocted his ‘eye of God’ scheme, which he had borrowed from the ancient Egyptian practice of painting watchful eyes on the to mbs of pharaohs to scare away would-be plunderers. Lansdale made a sketch of these eyes, and at night members of his team would slip into villages and paint them on a wall facing the house of a suspected Huk.” Other psychological- war tactics in cluded flying airplanes above the clouds over Huk-controlled areas, with broadcasts in native languages to make the villagers believe they were hearing directly from the spirit world; and spreading rumors about the presence of aswang in the area. The combination of psychological warfare, hearts-and-minds programs, and old-fashioned military operations proved to be highly effective, setting the prototype for future counterinsurgency wars, most notably in Vietnam, but also in Latin America. U. S. in volvement in Vietnam in all likelihood would have been radically different with out this earlier in tervention in the Philippines. The success in breaking the back of the Huk in surgency, though, was as much Magsaysay’s doing as the CIA’s. He had become the humane face of the anti- Huk program, a veteran guerrilla fighter who in his in teractions with the rural folk lent a sympathetic ear to their too-common tales of high rents and landlord abuse, making free legal services available to them. According to a for mer Huk fighter, Alfredo B. Saulo, Magsaysay was aided tremendously when “Tarcisio Rizal, alias Arthur, a grandson of the national hero and disenchanted Huk commander, approached Magsaysay and gave him vital in for mation on the whereabouts of the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] hierarchy in Manila.” The in for mation led to the arrest of many of the top leaders of the in surgency, dealing the Huks a severe blow from which they never recovered. Many of the guerrillas simply resumed their lives, and a significant number accepted the government’s of fer of land in Mindanao and Palawan. With the backing of Washington, Magsaysay decided to seek the presidency. Lansdale and his CIA colleagues managed the campaign—from behind the scenes, of course. One of the CIA operatives helping in the campaign and occasionally writing Magsaysay’s speeches was David Sternberg, whose cover was as the correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor. Magsaysay defected from the Quirino-led Liberal Party to the Nacionalistas in 1952, along with Carlos P. Garcia, a congressman from the island of Bohol as his vice presidential mate. In the campaign against President Quirino, the Magsaysay camp relied on the catchy motto, “Magsaysay Is My Guy.” This could have very well referred to Lansdale’s control over the for mer Defense Secretary’s candidacy, in cluding the writing of his speeches by CIA operatives. Lansdale made sure that cash flowed in not only from Langley, Virginia, but from American expatriates in the Philippines. Magsaysay, too, had become their guy. Magsaysay won the presidency handily. He had put to good use his experience as Defense Secretary. Unlike the politicians of the old ilustrado or der, of which Quirino was a member, Magsaysay conducted a vigorous grass-roots campaign, visiting more barrios and sitios than other politicians. He dressed simply, ate with his hands when eating with the local folk, and tried to project the persona of a common tao. This was in stark contrast with Quirino, who favored white suits—appealing perhaps to the urban and moneyed classes but not to the countryside, where the vast majority of the population lived. During his term, the third president of the Republic struck a populist tone, declaring that “bare feet will always be welcome at the president’s palace.” At the same time, he was still very much Washington’s guy. He was in strumental in the for mation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Also known as the Manila Pact, since it was first drafted there in September of 1954, SEATO was for mally established in Bangkok the next year, where its headquarters were to be located. Meant primarily as an anti-Communist or ganization and part of the Cold War geopolitical strategy of containment, SEATO had eight members: the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Formed or iginally by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and later on admitting five other Southeast Asian countries, the or ganization has no Western nation members. Some of its aims are to foster economic growth, promote peace and stability in the region, and encourage cultural development. Partly as unofficial representative of the United States and partly out of self- in terest, the Philippines participated in the 1955 Bandung Conference of Afro- Asian states held in Bandung, Indonesia. The conference brought to gether nations newly in dependent from colonial shackles, desirous of seeking a third way or neutrality, and in many in stances, hostile to the U. S. but also wary of the Soviet Union. The conference aimed to cultivate economic and cultural ties between the at tending states, and to resist any colonial or neocolonial policies the superpowers and their allies might seek to impose on them. The Philippines was one of the few in at tendance that viewed the United States in a positive light. During the Magsaysay administration the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 was revised via the Laurel Langley Agreement of 1955. This new legislation eliminated some of the more odious language that demeaned Philippine sovereignty, though this was more style than substance. In force for the next two decades, the agreement still protected U. S. in vestments in the for mer colony but now extended the same degree of reciprocity to those Filipinos wishing to in vest in the United States. Considering the huge disparities in capital available respectively to U. S. citizens and to Filipinos, this was akin to what Anatole France once said about pre-Revolutionary France’s Legislation: “The law in its majestic equality for bids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges and to steal bread.” As a sop to the sugar barons who were an in fluential bloc in the Philippine Congress, the U. S. agreed to pay higher prices for their sugar than could be had on the in ternational market, thus providing a tremendous windfall for the sugar planters. Because of Lansdale and the CIA’s in fluence on Magsaysay—the president had appointed his ment or as military adviser—U. S. programs directed at other Southeast Asian countries could be run through a pliant Philippine government, which would provide legitimate cover. In the 1950 s the situation in French Indochina—Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—in particular, the Communist in surgency led by Ho Chi Minh, worried the United States. In 1954 Lansdale (now stationed in Saigon as an adviser to the South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem) set up the Freedom Company of the Philippines, through which Filipino personnel were sent to South Vietnam to help the regime. Magsaysay was the company’s honorary president. Under cover of a public service or ganization and having a contract with the host government, Filipinos (and the CIA) assisted Diem’s government, at one point training his Presidential Guard Battalion, and ran the huge Operation Brotherhood activity. The latter began as a humanitarian, largely Philippine, project in 1954, thought of by the Philippine Jaycees to alleviate the miserable conditions of refugees fleeing North Vietnam into South Vietnam. Operation Brotherhood functioned in Vietnam for two years, primarily through medical missions, then moved its operations to Laos at the end of 1956. Operation Brotherhood was yet another plausible cover to operate against the Communists and assist the Diem regime. It was only in Vietnam where Filipinos worked successfully. In the rest of Southeast Asia, they were perceived as being too pro-American, and their very presence in Vietnam seemed to confirm this. Confident in the friendship of Magsaysay, the U. S. didn’t shy away from the use of U. S. bases in the 1950 s, for covert operations against perceived anti-U. S., pro-Communist for ces not just within the Philippines—the anti-Huk campaign being the most well-known—but in Southeast Asia as well. Civil Air Transport, for in stance, was an airline owned by the CIA that flew out of Clark Air Base to ferry support to Indonesian right-wing army of ficers in their failed at tempt in the late 1950 s to unseat President Sukarno, a key architect of the nonaligned movement among Third World countries and one of the principal or ganizers of the Bandung Conference. Magsaysay’s presidency was cut short when, on March 17, 1957, he died in a plane crash, returning from Cebu City to Manila. An estimated two million mourners paid their respects to the dead president as his funeral procession wound its way through Manila. His death caused no small amount of confusion, as Magsaysay’s personal support and popularity had made various clandestine and not-so-clandestine activities possible, from the for mation of SEATO to covert programs in Vietnam and Indonesia, all justified by the on going project to convert the for mer colony into America’s much to uted showcase of democracy. Magsaysay’s vice president, Carlos P. García, took over for the remainder of Magsaysay’s term and went on to win the presidential elections the next year, 1958. His vice-president was Diosdado Macapagal, from the province of Pampanga in Central Luzon. Another Odd Couple The presidential contest to succeed Magsaysay was a four-man affair: Carlos P. García, a Nacionalista who as vice president, had taken over the presidency; Manuel Manahan, for mer customs commissioner and a Magsaysay follower; José Yulo, from the Liberal Party; and Senator Claro M.

García, a Nacionalista who as vice president, had taken over the presidency; Manuel Manahan, for mer customs commissioner and a Magsaysay follower; José Yulo, from the Liberal Party; and Senator Claro M. Recto, the head of the Convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. The last was the U. S.’s bete noire. Recto was an outspoken nationalist who had served in the pre-war commonwealth government and had become in creasingly disillusioned by what he felt was unwarranted U. S. in volvement. He advocated a for eign policy that distanced itself from that of the United States. Thus, he felt it was in the best in terests of the country to deal with China even if it had gone Communist— heretical thinking as far as the United States was concerned that viewed Mao Tse-tung, an ally of the Soviet Union, as a major ideological enemy. The Korean War was a reminder that Mao’s Red Army was willing to mix it up with the U. S. and hold its own. But most galling to the United States government was Recto’s stand against the continued presence of U. S. military bases on Philippine territory. In 1956, Recto wrote that “by granting America extra-territorial rights in the bases, we surrendered to her the power, the jurisdiction, and the sovereignty of the Republic over portions of the national territory whose in tegrity is guaranteed by … the Constitution. So the Agreement, in stead of in suring our territorial in tegrity accomplished the very opposite.” U. S. strategy had always been to emphasize the bases as a contribution to Philippine defense. Recto’s stance skewered this position. In 1957 he emphasized that even American commentators highlighted the use of the bases in the Philippines as a diversion for enemy at tacks, especially a nuclear one, that would spare the lives of Americans in the United States. He cited one Hanson Baldwin, an expert on the U. S. military who wrote regularly for The New York Times, who believed, according to Recto, that “the role of U. S. overseas bases in the world—bases in the Philippines are among them—is to ‘act as magnets for enemy at tacks, thus dispersing and weakening his threat to our [United States] cities and fixed in stallations.’” Recto had only to point to Japan’s in vasion of the Philippines in 1941 as proof of this fatal at traction. Recto saw first-hand how Magsaysay’s feeling of in debtedness to Washington had in fluenced Philippine government policy. It was a classic example of utang na loob, a social quality, deemed a virtue, whereby a man who had benefited significantly from a patron’s in tervention was for ever in that patron’s debt. In Magsaysay’s case, he felt beholden to Lansdale and the U. S. for his success in quelling the Huk rebellion and in winning Malacañang. Too, it helped that Magsaysay himself was staunchly anti-Communist. Recto had broken completely with the popular president and for med the Nationalist Citizens Party. His in creasingly nationalist stance worried the CIA. Its operatives blanched at the possibility that a Recto victory would result in Manila dealing openly with Mao’s China. The NCP lacked funds, however, and a smooth electoral machinery. The two dominant parties, the LP and the NP, colluded to deny it election in spectors. The conservative Catholic hierarchy had no love for Recto either, as he had in 1955 championed the compulsory reading and teaching in colleges and universities of José Rizal’s anti-clerical novels. His Rizal bill, as it was known, passed, but exempted students who had religious objections from reading the novels. The proviso in effect enabled Catholic educational in stitutions (and they were, as in the Spanish colonial era, the dominant force in private education) to simply not in clude the books on the curriculum, even if there were students who may have wanted to study the life and works of the national hero. As to be expected, the CIA used its bag of dirty tricks against Recto, and had him labeled as a Communist dupe. According to J. Burckholder Smith, a CIA operative in Manila at the time, the agency spread the word that Recto was “a Chinese communist stooge, an agent in filtrated into the Philippine Senate (shades of Senator Joe Mc Carthy).” Smith further states that “he had been subjected to various dirty tricks. As I went through the files, I found something that absolutely astounded me. I saw a sealed envelope marked ‘Recto Campaign.’ I opened it and found it filled with condoms, marked ‘courtesy of Claro M. Recto—the People’s Friend.’ The condoms all had holes in them at the place they could least afford to have them. I tried to find out what purpose the condoms had been supposed to serve. The best I could do was to learn that they were distributed to show how Recto would let you down.” Unlike the condoms, the CIA didn’t fail. And so Claro M. Recto, garnering barely 400,000 ballots, lost the presidential election to García. What aided García as well was the fact that, in cluding Recto, three rivals had split the opposition vote. Relatively unknown, García had been a guerrilla during the war in Bohol, his home province, though he belonged to a unit in dependent of the USAFFE. Not particularly identified with U. S. in terests, unlike Roxas and Magsaysay, García had opposed the Bell Trade Act and the Military Bases Agreement. As chief executive of the land, this diminutive man proved more in dependent of U. S. thinking than the late, burly Magsaysay. He proposed re-examining the bases agreement, created a for eign-exchange reserve not wholly reliant on the almighty dollar, and was ready to assume a neutralist stance to wards Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Most shockingly to those American hands and seasoned politicians who expected residents in Malacañang to be unswervingly loyal to the U. S., he drew up a Filipino First policy"

Most shockingly to those American hands and seasoned politicians who expected residents in Malacañang to be unswervingly loyal to the U. S., he drew up a Filipino First policy. As promulgated by the government National Economic Council, it was a policy “of the government to encourage Filipinos to engage in enterprises and in dustries vital to economic growth, stability, and security of the country,” giving special at tention to businesses that might in fact be controlled by non-Filipinos. The policy also laid down stringent rules on the allocation of for eign exchange, favoring Filipinos or corporations that were at least sixty percent controlled by Filipinos. As to be expected, U. S. and pro-U. S. sectors denounced the Filipino First policy. The U. S. Chamber of Commerce, through its publication, described the program as “nothing less than in sane,” with “measureless loss and waste, retrogression, and demoralization.” A February 27, 1959, issue of the U. S. News and World Report depicted it as “extreme nationalism,” going on to say that what the program in tended to do was in separable “from what the Communists say and want.” Even more disturbing to the pro-U. S. sectors was the coalition between García’s NP and his for mer rival for the presidency, Recto and his NCP, gearing up for the 1959 senatorial elections. A mass or ganization had also sprung up, the National Progress Movement, which aimed to generate support for a nationalist- or iented government, to wards which the retention of García was deemed necessary. The NPM ascribed to the sizeable alien communities (Chinese and American) in Philippine society the root causes of “graft corruption in the government and ultimately, in the entire society,” for these aliens sought to buy off government authorities and thus extend their in fluence. The NPM came down particularly hard on Filipinos working to advance for eign in terests, describing them as “parasites who feed with out contributing to their own national community, its culture and the civilization it may yet at tain.” The García and Recto coalition as well as the NPM in effect turned a critical eye on the neocolonial legacies of U. S. rule. Filipinization echoed the earlier policies of the colonial-era William Howard Taft, ironically enough, but this time carried to its logical conclusion: adoption of nationalist programs as envisioned by the Filipino First policy; elimination of the parity amendment to the Constitution; an in dependent for eign policy; and in dustrialization. The 1959 elections saw the defeat of for mer Magsaysay men and pro-U. S. adherents, and the victories of more in dependent legislators, in cluding the for mer Solicitor General Lorenzo Tañada. Emboldened by the 1959 electoral results, President García declared in a major speech in 1960 that the control of the economy by aliens “makes a mockery of our in dependence and robs it of substance and meaning.” It was necessary, the refore, “that Filipinos acquire a major and dominant participation in the national economy of the Philippines.” At the same time, he stressed that his government’s economic policies were not anti-American, that they were “simply an honest-to-goodness effort of the Filipino people to be masters in their own economic household for exactly the same reason that Americans would be masters of the U. S. national economy … In this country there is still room for for eign capital, especially in fields where Filipino capital is deficient or timid.” And what were the results of the Filipino First policy? For one thing, the policy enabled Filipinos to secure 51 percent of for eign exchange allocations by the end of 1959. It liberalized government credit to new Filipino businesses, resulting in fresh in fusions of capital into the in dustrial sector. In December 1959 only 55 percent of new in vestments were Filipino; by 1961 the figure had jumped to 88 percent. In the in dustrial sector, a significant development came with the creation of the Filipino Oil Refining Company in 1959, challenging the dominance of U. S. and other for eign oil companies. There was the Iligan Integrated Steel Mill, Inc., a $1 billion venture, the first stage of a full-fledged Philippine steel in dustry, which began loan negotiations with the World Bank, the U. S. Export-Import Bank, and other lending in stitutions. Iligan represented a partnership of government and private Filipino capital and exemplified the García’s administration’s in dustrialization policies. In 1960, the Manila Electric Company, or Meralco, a U. S. owned company founded in 1903, was acquired by a financial group headed by the López family for $66 million. All these developments seemed to augur well for full-scale in dustrialization. For the 1961 elections a García-Recto ticket loomed as a real possibility— and a perceived threat to pro-U. S. in terests. Claro M. Recto died in Rome, however, of a heart at tack on October 2, 1960, leaving the nationalist movement bereft of its leading in tellectual and political voice. Not surprisingly, the opposition to García swung behind his vice president Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party. Macapagal, along with the Grand Alliance ticket, whose slate had been defeated in 1959, campaigned on issues such as corruption; the necessity of maintaining an anti-Communist stance (which the nationalist Filipino First was thought to have hurt); development of free and private enterprise; and minimal government in terference in the private sector, or the adoption of essentially neo-liberal laissez-faire economic policies. The issue of strict controls over for eign exchange allocations proved damaging to García, for it was one the Macapagal camp exploited, charging the government with using controls as a means of patronage"

The issue of strict controls over for eign exchange allocations proved damaging to García, for it was one the Macapagal camp exploited, charging the government with using controls as a means of patronage. With Recto no longer on the scene to in sist on a strictly nationalist or ientation, the García campaign declared that it would gradually ease controls—a concession to free marketers. Macapagal’s campaign team also utilized their candidate’s impoverished background as a selling point. He was the “poor boy from Lubao,” a small town from Pampanga, the Central Luzon province. He managed to at tend law school, and to pped the bar exams in 1936. He went on to serve as legal assistant to Quezon. After the war, having served two terms in the House of Representatives, in 1957 he ran as the vice presidential candidate of José Yulo on a ticket that opposed García. Yulo lost to García, but Macapagal won. (In the Philippine electoral system, the vice president is voted in in dependently of the president.) In contrast García, who had acquired a reputation for poetry as a young man, came from the gentry of Bohol, where his father had served as mayor of their town for four terms. Macapagal and his running mate Emmanuel Pelaez won the 1961 elections by a substantial margin. President Macapagal immediately signaled his administration’s commitment to free enterprise. One of his first acts was to implement decontrol of for eign-exchange allocations and of imports. The government had previously with varying degrees of success at tempted to minimize the squandering of dollar reserves by requiring the purchase of a license with which to purchase dollars and thus ship in imports. An in evitable result was a black market in the sale and purchase of such licenses, enabling many, in and out of government, to illicitly amass considerable wealth through the disparity in the of ficial and unofficial exchange rates. With easy money to be made, not much energy was channeled to wards setting up new in dustries. Corruption thus became a potent issue with which Macapagal hammered García during their electoral contest. On the advice of his cabinet, Macapagal adopted neo-liberal economic policies, and decided to let the peso float, which had until then been pegged at a two-to-one ratio to the dollar. With the new policy, the peso’s value dropped to P 3.90 to the dollar. Liberalizing trade meant easing or eliminating protectionist measures, resulting in a sharp in crease in the shipment of U. S. goods to the country and a corresponding decline in the sales of their counterpart Philippine products. While the devaluation of the peso meant that prices for U. S. products —which were prized, “Stateside” being a mark of approval—in creased, it also meant that those domestic in dustries that had imported equipment and contracted for eign loans now saw their operating costs and more significantly their capital obligations practically double. In addition, the facilitating of credit to local in dustry, which the García administration allowed, was curbed. As a result, squeezed on both ends, as many as 1,500 Filipino in dustries that had sprung up because of García’s Filipino First policies were driven out of business during Macapagal’s tenure, or were absorbed by larger companies, many of these having substantial U. S. in vestments. The devaluation of the peso in evitably made in vestment in the Philippines more at tractive to for eign capital. Another unwanted consequence of decontrol, from the point of view of local in dustry, was the easier repatriation of profits of U. S. companies once restricted under exchange controls. With dollars flowing out, and imports flowing in, the country’s for eign reserves declined. To alleviate this, the government began to in crease its for eign debt. At the end of García’s term, the country’s for eign debt stood at a completely manageable $200 million. In 1962, in its first year in of fice, the Macapagal administration sought and got approved a $300 million loan from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the U. S. Treasury. Going into Ferdinand Marcos’s tenure, by 1972 the country’s external debt stood at $2 billion. Macapagal had set a pattern of borrowing that has been followed ever since, essentially adhering to the free-market policies of in ternational lending agencies that encouraged for eign in vestment by lifting controls, tightening credit, allowing the local currency to float, and reducing spending on social programs. President Macapagal at tempted to address the age-old issue of land reform, getting Congress to enact in 1963 the Agricultural Land Reform Code. It was an ambitious law that sought to abolish sharecropping tenancy, and carve out of large estates smaller family-size farms. The law promised to provide a wide variety of government technical and credit assistance to the beneficiaries of the reform. But a landlord-dominated Congress at tached so many conditions and exemptions that beyond reorganizing a number of agencies and redefining their functions so as to streamline their operations, this law achieved little in the way of meaningful change. In the first half of the 1960 s, coincident with the Macapagal administration, nationalism continued to build steam even as government policies reflected the old-or der accommodation with the United States.

There were some grumbles from staunchly pro- American sectors but no serious complaints, as the change, while an important symbolic concession to nationalist sentiment, affected neither the economic nor political arena. One of the slogans the Macapagal administration to uted was for the citizenry to complete the “Unfinished Revolution”—a clear reference to the Bonifacio-led 1896 Katipunan Revolution. As the 1960 s wore on, there was a growing awareness as well as critique of how colonial legacies had shaped the cultural landscape, from education and pop culture to the way history had been written and the use of English as the dominant language of national discourse in education, politics, the arts, and the media. The rebelliousness of the decade would be expressed vigorously and dramatically in the latter half, during the tenure of the next president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. F ERDINAND M ARCOS: B EFORE M ARTIAL L AW Born on September 11, 1917, in Sarrat Town, Ilocos Norte Province, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos may never have had a political career had he not been able to beat a murder rap against him. The murder victim was Julio Nalundasan, a political rival of his father who had just won the congressional election for the district. He was shot to death one night in 1935, with a.22 caliber bullet. The young Marcos, known to be a member of the University of the Philippines pistol team, came under heavy suspicion. Three years later, in 1938, he was arrested, jailed, and subsequently convicted. By then, Marcos had graduated from the University of the Philippines law school. On appeal—which Marcos wrote in his cell—the Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision in 1940, the same year the future dictator to pped the bar. The chief justice was José P. Laurel who would in a little more than two years head the government under Japanese occupation. After the war, in which he claimed to have led a crack guerrilla unit that scored numerous successes against the Japanese, Marcos had a short stint as a practicing lawyer. He then ran for and won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1949. After two successive terms, he campaigned for the Senate as a Liberal Party candidate in 1959, and managed Macapagal’s run for the presidency of the country. By then he had been married to Imelda Romualdez, a statuesque for mer beauty pageant queen from Tacloban City, capital of the Visayan island of Leyte. Imelda had gone to Manila in 1953 at the age of twenty-four to stay with her wealthier city cousins and seek some kind of gainful employment. While visiting Congress in 1954—her uncle was then speaker of the house—she met Ferdinand Marcos in the cafeteria. After a whirlwind courtship that lasted all of ten days, the two were married at Manila Cathedral. Initially, Imelda had difficulty in the role of a well-known politician’s wife, with its unceasing demands for public appearances with her husband and so little time for herself and her family. At one point, the young and in experienced Imelda suffered a nervous breakdown and sought treatment in New York City. The treatment was apparently successful, perhaps too successful: she returned to Manila, having made up her mind to fully accept her role as a public figure and the varied and exhausting obligations that came with it. As she grew accustomed to being in the public gaze, and as her husband climbed all the way to the top, she developed sharp political in stincts that enabled her to become a powerful player in her own right. Imelda proved to be a tremendous asset to Ferdinand’s campaign for the presidency, for which, in a now time-honored though dubious practice, the ambitious senator switched from the Liberal Party—Macapagal, its head, was running for reelection—to the Nacionalistas. The youthful and glamorous Imelda made most other politicians’ wives look positively dowdy. Putting to use her beauty pageant experience, she was soon wowing crowds with her charm and earnest singing, of ten in duets with her husband. A huge feature of the hustings in Philippine politics is entertaining the crowds that gather to hear different candidates make their pitches. The palabas, as these spectacles are known, regularly feature movie and media celebrities, and a candidate who can add some showbiz to his or her or at or ical skills is almost sure to win more votes. The lady from Leyte proved to be a charmer of fstage as well. Needing a vice presidential candidate, Marcos had approached Fernando López, the sugar baron and media mogul and one of the richest men in the country. His bailiwick was the Visayas, where Imelda was from. Initially reluctant to be on the Marcos team, he was sweet-talked into it by Imelda. The Marcos-López combination proved to be a winner, and in December of 1965, both men were sworn into of fice. Hailed as the Jackie Kennedy of Asia by the Western press, Imelda held considerable cachet with the public, and this was flamboyantly demonstrated in 1966, when the Beatles flew to Manila for a two-concert stopover on July 3, 1966. The next day, July 4, they were scheduled to perform at the open-air Rizal Memorial Stadium. The Fab Four had been in vited to Malacañang to have an early lunch before the first concert with Imelda, along with three hundred schoolchildren. There was a mixup in communications, and the quartet slept through the appointed hour, blissfully unaware that they had disappointed not just the First Lady but a whole bevy of pre-teen Beatles’ fans. Word got around about the alleged snub. Departing the next day for New Delhi, the band and their entourage were manhandled as well as booed by outraged crowds"

The unfortunate in cident would prompt George Harrison to remark that if he were ever to return to Manila, it would be to drop an at omic bomb. While the country had a highly trained English-speaking professional workforce, there simply weren’t enough jobs to keep pace with the in flux of graduates that every year flooded the labor market. Coupled with a growing population, chronic bureaucratic in efficiency and endemic government corruption, the Marcos government faced for midable challenges in revitalizing an ailing economy. In his in augural address, Marcos acknowledged the challenges the country faced, stating, “We have ceased to value or der. Government is gripping the iron hand of venality, its treasury is barren, its resources are wasted, its civil service is slothful and in different, its armed for ces demoralized and its councils sterile.” In the manner of John F. Kennedy, to whom he liked to be compared, he exhorted his compatriots to work with him and rise to the occasion: “Not one hero alone do I ask from you, but many—nay, all.” Marcos proved to be a shrewder bargainer than his predecessors when it came to dealing with the United States. Adopting a nationalist tone while maintaining client-state status with the United States, he used in-country U. S. military bases as a bargaining chip to secure more dollars, which his administration deemed rent but which the United States labeled “aid.” United States in volvement in Vietnam was escalating, and Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base were key staging points for that in tervention, as they had been in other, earlier Asian conflicts. In 1966, after in tense negotiations, the Lyndon B. Johnson administration and the Philippine government agreed to reduce the bases lease from 99 years to 25 years, to end in 1991 and the reafter be renegotiated. The war in Vietnam was an economic shot-in-the-arm, at least in the short term, for the economy, particularly for the metropolitan areas in which Clark and Subic were located. Playing up his anti-Communist card, and trumpeting his devotion to democratic principles, Marcos was a master manipulator of U. S.- Philippine relations. Out of self-in terest, Washington ignored the in creasing levels of corruption, both personal and governmental, within the Marcos administration. The legitimacy of Marcos’s tenure, in deed, of the traditions of centralized political power in an oligarchy and the neocolonial relationship with the United States, was challenged by a dramatic in crease in student activism globally along with a resurgence of radical left-wing movements. In particular, 1968 proved to be a watershed year in this respect, an in dication of how far the energizing and liberating spirit of a counterculture had spread, one that used drugs regularly and for whom rock’n’roll was a religion. In Chicago, anti-war demonstrators at the Democratic Convention were brutalized by Mayor Richard Daley’s cops. In New York City, students occupied Columbia University’s administrative of fices. Students rioted in Paris and in Prague defied Soviet tanks that rolled in to crush the stirrings of a nascent democratization known as the “Prague Spring.” And on the birthday of Mao Tes-tung, December 26, 1968, a young University of the Philippines professor by the name of José Maria Sison founded the breakaway Communist Party of the Philippines in reaction to what he considered the outmoded Soviet-leaning PKP. (He and other student radicals from the University of the Philippines and Lyceum of the Philippines had been recruited in 1964 by a revived PKP.) Sison, born in Ilocos Sur, was a 1959 graduate of the University of the Philippines and started teaching there as a literature professor. Active in student politics, he founded the radical student group, Kabataan Makabayan (KM), or Nationalist Youth, in 1964. The group or ganized protests against the Vietnam War as U. S. in volvement in that Southeast Asian country was in creasing. Its members also regularly demonstrated against Ferdinand Marcos’s administration. The new CPP identified with Mao’s China rather than with the Soviet Union, Sison arguing that the Chinese model was closer to home. Not only were the Chinese fellow Asians, but the guerrilla strategy Mao advocated—that of surrounding the cities from the countryside—made tactical sense. Too, the Cultural Revolution, begun in 1966, in spired young left-wing ideologues with its aim of purging classist elements from society and renewing the commitment for the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship. Additionally, many Filipino student activists had visited the People’s Republic of China and had for ged relationships with the Chinese. In March of 1969, Bernabe Buscayno, a young Huk guerrilla in Tarlac Province, Central Luzon, and his outfit, unhappy with the Huk leadership, joined for ces with Sison to create the New People’s Army. The son of dirt-poor tenant farmers whose widowed father had given him and his siblings up for adoption, Buscayno had been radicalized at a young age, and helped or ganize farm laborers. It wasn’t a particularly auspicious beginning, as the twenty-five-year- old Buscayno, with the nom de guerre of Kumander Dante, and his band of about 35 fighters had between them only ten rifles. Nevertheless, the CPP/NPA grew, slowly at first and with painful and at times bloody birth pangs, but surely, through Luzon and the rest of the country—aided immeasurably in its growth by Ferdinand Marcos’s declaration of martial law three years later, in 1972.

Nine months after the CPP was founded, in September of 1969, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) was in augurated. It was Imelda’s personal project—the first of many grandiose projects she would undertake in her long political career and for which she was sardonically said to have an “edifice complex.” At the festive opening ceremonies, California Governor Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were Imelda’s honored guests, beginning a special relationship that would immeasurably benefit the Marcoses during the martial- law era. Critics derided the Center as a waste of money in an impoverished country. The CCP cost $8.5 million—a huge sum in those days—with $3.5 million coming from the U. S. government, which classified the money as war damage claims. Furthermore, Filipino in tellectuals and artists believed the Center was designed to showcase the West rather than fulfill any home-grown aspirations. Indeed, the first months of programming featured in ternationally known groups like the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the New York Chamber Soloists. There were dance companies from India and operatic troupes from China and Japan. No matter: with the CCP, Imelda made it clear she was at the very least determined to be a national cultural force, a czarina of the arts. In 1969, Ferdinand Marcos won reelection against Sergio Osmeña Jr., son of the for mer commonwealth president, thus becoming the first Filipino president to win a second term. However, his 2,000,000-vote margin of victory was glaringly and credibly suspicious. Marcos would probably have won in a by-the- rules contest, since Osmeña was a lackluster politician but in the hardball, no- quarter-given world of Philippine politics, the in cumbent was expected to use every resource at his command to guarantee victory, even if it meant overkill. By all accounts, up to that point, the elections were the most corrupt and expensive, rendering government coffers practically bare and resulting in in flation. The results provoked widespread outrage, none more so than among students and workers. By then, Marcos had embarked on a self-mythologizing path, and it was through one such endeavor that student activists were able to get a measure of revenge. Their in strument happened to be Dovie Beams, a barely known, C-List Hollywood actress who had been hired in 1968 to play the romantic lead on a biopic of Ferdinand Marcos, Maharlika. She wound up playing a real-life role as his mistress for two years—a role bigger than any she ever had on the silver screen. Tiring of her, Marcos broke off the relationship at the start of 1970. Imelda by this time had gotten wind of the affair and was furious at this betrayal. Beams, fearing for her life, placed herself under the protection of the U. S. Embassy. Unbeknownst to Marcos, she had tape recorded some of their amorous trysts, as the implications of her romantic entanglement became clear to her. She played some of the tapes at press conferences. Copies were surreptitiously made and leaked to the public. Student activists at the University of the Philippines got hold of a copy, one in which, according to a published account, the president is asking Beams to perform fellatio. The delighted students broadcast it in an endless loop over campus radio, much to the public embarrassment of the presidential family—and the ire of the First Lady. On November 11, 1970, Beams, escorted to the airport by a U. S. consul, boarded a flight back to the U. S. L’affaire Beams couldn’t have come at a worse time, as protests against the Marcos government had reached fever pitch during the First Quarter Storm, or FQS. The FQS was the most violent manifestation of unrest in postwar history up to that point, made up of rallies, protests, and marches held by a coalition of student groups—Sison’s Kabataan Makabayan was a major player—labor unions, and farmer or ganizations between January and March of 1970. The object of their ire was the Marcos government, seen as especially corrupt, and its collaboration with the United States in its war against the Vietnamese. The FQS began on January 26, 1970, on the streets outside of Congress, after Marcos’s state-of-the-nation speech. As he and the elegantly at tired Imelda exited, they were met by a screaming crowd of 20,000 students, workers, and peasants, mouthing obscenities and displaying papier-mâché crocodiles (symbols of rapacity), hurling rocks and bottles. Never had any of the nation’s previous presidents been so embarrassed. Things came to head on January 30, 1970. Protesters marched to Malacañang and the worst riots in the country’s history erupted when the demonstrators at tempted to storm Malacañang. Shouting slogans targeting U. S. imperialism and the subservient role of the Philippine state and bemoaning the lack of a true democracy, the demonstrators somehow commandeered a fire truck and rammed it into one of the palace gates. The protesters were dispersed violently by policemen and soldiers, in cluding the Presidential Security Guard. In the ensuing melee, a twenty-three-year-old university student was shot in the head. All day long, protesters and security for ces played a cat-and-mouse game in the nearby districts that, with its narrow lanes and sympathetic in habitants, provided the activists with cover, enough for most of them to ride out the storm. Other marches and demonstrations took place the following weeks, of ten with the U. S. embassy as the target, but none matched the in tensity of that assault on Malacañang.

An even more explosive—literally and figuratively—event took place the next year that made a nervous society even more nervous. On the humid night of August 21, 1971, the Liberal Party, in opposition to Marcos’s Nacionalistas, was holding a campaign rally for its senatorial candidates for elections scheduled for later that year. The outdoor gathering was at Plaza Miranda, Manila’s Hyde Park and a historic spot for rallies of all sorts. More than 10,000 supporters were on hand, many, no doubt, there just to enjoy the palabas. Two fragmentation grenades were lobbed onto the stage after 9 p. m., killing a five-year-old child, a photographer, and seven others. Ninety-five were in jured, in cluding three of the Liberal candidates and the candidate for the mayoralty of Manila, who lost one of his legs. The blame naturally fell on Marcos and his minions, though years later the CPP head José Maria Sison was thought to have or dered the bombings. Both Marcos and Sison denied the charges. The bombings created tremendous sympathy for the Liberal Party, so that six of the eight Senate seats up for grabs went to the LP, as did the mayoralty of Manila. By 1972, the Marcos administration repeatedly warned of the fast-spreading Communist threat from within, with Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile leading the chorus. In September, three days after another warning issued by Enrile, two early morning explosions damaged Meralco sub-stations, with little damage. The military blamed Communist plotters. The crowning moment in this Moro-Moro (a Spanish colonial-era drama where the ending is utterly predictable) was the fake assassination at tempt on Enrile himself. On the fateful day of September 21, 1972, Enrile had decided to ride in his security car, rather than his own, later escaping the fusillade of automatic-weapons fire directed at his car by ambushers. His good for tune was ascribed to God’s in tervention. The deity in this case, however, was a two-personned God: Marcos and Enrile himself. The at tempted assassination, according to the government, left it no choice but to declare martial law. The next day, September 22, Proclamation 1081 put into place martial law, signed by President Marcos but backdated to September 21, due to the president’s superstitious belief in the magical powers of 7 (by which 21 is divisible). Military units fanned out across the city to arrest political opponents, activists, and anyone suspected by the regime of subversion. The first politician picked up was Senator Benigno Aquino Jr."

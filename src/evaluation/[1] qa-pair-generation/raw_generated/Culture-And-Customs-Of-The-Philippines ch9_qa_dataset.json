Many people speak English, in cluding folks from small provincial to wns and not just the sophisticated urbanites of Manila, Cebu, Baguio, and other major cities. Other aspects of the country’s culture, in cluding religion, dress, architecture, music, and dance, are also recognizable, even if subtle differences soon warn the visitor that all is not necessarily the way he or she assumed they would be. However, it is the easy familiarity by which Filipinos deal with Americans and their apparent openness and friendliness that can prove confusing to the newcomer, since many signals that Filipinos send out seem to mean one thing but in fact may mean something altogether different. A good example of how assumptions are based on apparent cultural similarities is the use of the word yes. At first glance, this could hardly be a problem since the meaning of the word is very clear. But yes is not a clear concept in the Philippines, and guidebooks written for visiting businessmen make a point of warning their readers about this word and its tricky cultural context.1 Filipinos, the guidebook warns, will say yes when they are not sure and even when they actually mean no. This is not done to be duplicitous but, rather, to be hospitable so the for eigner will not be disappointed. Instead of saying no, the Filipino will use a variety of ambiguous statements in addition to speech in flections and physical gestures to in dicate that the real answer should be seen as something less than what was actually said. While perfectly in keeping with Filipino culture, this practice thoroughly baffles, confounds, and sometimes in furiates the American visitor"

While perfectly in keeping with Filipino culture, this practice thoroughly baffles, confounds, and sometimes in furiates the American visitor. This chapter explores some of the cultural differences that make Filipino Page 196 social customs so different from what is known in the West, especially the United States. To do so this chapter will pick up from Chapter Six’s discussion of the development of Filipinos from birth to adulthood, but with a different focus. While Chapter Six focused on courtship, marriage, and the replication of the Filipino family, the discussion in this chapter looks at the creation of the in dividual as he or she is made into a representative of Philippine culture and how he or she is expected to act as a Filipino. In addition to this cultural examination, this chapter also examines the for mal structure of the Philippine education system and looks at the country’s social stratification and how ethnic diversity is managed. Finally, the social problem of the massive overseas migration of many thousands of Filipinos in search of employment is examined. CHILDREN IN FAMILY AND SOCIETY As in all societies, the Filipino family raises its young to participate in the wider society and not simply as a member of the basic family unit. Social values are passed on to the child and in ternalized in a process of socialization. Filipino in fants are the object of constant at tention by all surrounding adults and elder siblings and are never left alone or allowed to cry. When a child beings to cry, it is immediately picked up and soothed and almost always given something to eat or play with. No matter how tired its parents may be, they drop whatever they are doing to at tend to the child"

When a child beings to cry, it is immediately picked up and soothed and almost always given something to eat or play with. No matter how tired its parents may be, they drop whatever they are doing to at tend to the child. This practice is not seen as spoiling the child, but as an obligation since is considered bad for a child to cry. The child soon learns that human society, especially the family, is a warm and friendly community that looks after his needs and wants even as he is granted freedom to explore the world. Eventually, however, discipline is imposed, usually by scolding and by threats to with hold affection until antisocial behavior is curbed.2 This form of discipline has the effect of socializing the child into appreciating the relationship between positive social behavior and continued rewards. Only in extreme cases is physical punishment used and then only when other means are exhausted. As a result of this gentle form of socialization that combines teaching by example and conditioning in addition to in struction, the child soon learns the basic value of group cooperation, respect, and obedience and just how far protests and self­in terested acts will be to lerated. From its earliest days, the Filipino child begins to in ternalize the important Filipino social value of pakikisama (to accompany or go along with for the benefit of group harmony), which serves as a guiding principle governing family relationships and in teractions in the wider community. Being group focused rather than in dividualistic, the Filipino in stinctively seeks out family members and those Page 197 with whom special relationships, such as the barkada discussed in the Chapter Six, have been carefully constructed.

Because the group is the focus of Filipinos, the coherence and quality of the relationships of its members becomes primary. This focus naturally leads to a concentration of the amor­propio (self­esteem) of the in dividual members of the group.3 Since the Filipino is raised to consider himself and herself as being at the center of a closely related kin­group, the feelings, and needs of its in dividual members must be respected so that everyone will participate in the activities of the whole. As a result, the child soon learns that conflict is something that must be avoided at all cost and that the supreme objective of in terpersonal relationships is that they be conducted as smoothly as possible. Disagreements are kept to a minimum and are dealt with by negotiations in tended to preserve the self­esteem of all parties. Should conflict divide Filipinos, the consequences can be devastating and longer lasting than in American society, which expects an in terplay of competition and conflict that will eventually lead to a resolution. In the Philippines, conflicts have the potential of creating permanent ruptures between in dividuals causing a shame (hiya) that cannot be mollified and destroying group cohesion. A key player in avoiding conflict or even potential embarrassment is the “go­between” who will speak on someone’s behalf. In Chapter Six’s discussion of the courtship process ment ion was made of the use of a friend who will speak to the woman on behalf of the suitor. This is a “go­between,” and if the young woman is not in terested in the young man, she can tell the in termediary with out causing either herself or the unacceptable suitor any sense of hiya"

While children may squabble from time to time, any disagreement that breaks out among Filipinos of adolescence or older will see many others rushing in to restore or der and reinforce the childhood lessons of maintaining what anthropologists at the Jesuit­run university in the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila University, have termed SIR, or smooth in terpersonal relations.4 The socialization lessons learned during early childhood are continued throughout youth. It is within this process of social growth that the activities of young boys going out with their fathers to work in the fields in rural areas takes on added meaning beyond the simple learning of farming techniques. Farming, especially rice farming, is both in dividual and communal in that a farmer will own or rent fields to support his family, but the seasonal requirements of preparing the soil, transplanting, irrigation management, and harvesting require cooperation by a number of farmers who share the occasionally in tensive labor requirements. A crop cannot be brought in with out a close working relationship with neighboring farmers. This shared work ethic is frequently termed the bayanihan spirit and is most frequently illus­ Page 198 trated by the traditional practice of shared work to erect a house, but the ethic is much more pervasive and deeply rooted than this example of an occasional group activity.

Even during dating, when the adolescent boy consults with his barkada mates about which girl he should court and seeks their approval of his selection, he is continuing a group­centered focus for his actions. As well, a young man’s cavorting with his male friends as they experiment with adult drinking and other forms of adult social behavior further reinforces the in dividual male’s group or ientation. All of these experiences in childhood and adolescence thus constitute an important link between the family or igins of behavior to that conducted later in the wider community. Girls and young women also develop bonds with some of their peers, but these ties do not become as well developed because females are expected to stay in the home and learn the skills needed for their future domestic roles as wives and mothers. Still, they too develop strong bonds with close friends that follow them through life, especially if they are in a rural community and do not move far from their birthplace. Quite unlike the situation in American society, where youth gangs can cause significant social problems, there is rarely a need to enforce conformity and restrain deviant youthful behavior in the Philippines. This is because the in dividual’s bonds to the group and wider community and the need for social approval are so strong that antisocial behavior is simply not an option. The only exceptions to this generalization would be peer groups that become in volved in criminal activity, but these are quickly dealt with in rural communities, and even the activities of youth gangs in large cities are quite limited compared to their counterparts in the United States. Instead of social deviance and rebellion, Filipino youth soon take on the approved values of the wider community. Primary among these values are a sense of obligation (pananagutan) that is centered in the family but has implications for the community, especially if one’s family is an active participant in a specific activity"

An in dividual who will not or cannot get along with the group suffers the worst fate possible: being cast out of the group. An in dividual who isolates himself from others or is ostracized is referred to as maka­sarili and is socially unacceptable.5 Such in dividuals, or even those who seem to display asocial behavior, will be vulnerable to with ering social gossip, or tsismis. While tsismis about someone’s personal life is a favorite Philippine pastime, and everyone is eventually talked about at one Page 199 time or another, gossip aimed at the asocial in dividual is powerful and usually has the ability to correct behavior in short or der.

The for eigner’s reward for conforming to socially acceptable behavior is loyal friendship that will last a lifetime and selfless efforts on his behalf, whether that assistance be personal or business related. Though not a social scientist, Douglas Mac Arthur had a long and extremely personal relationship with the Philippines and seems to have had an in tuitive understanding of how to operate within the culture. His warm and deep friendships with numerous Filipinos, and his wartime promise that “I Shall Return” which he conscientiously fulfilled, won him an outpouring of the nation’s affections that lasted well into the 1970 s. To this day, a portion of his penthouse suite in the prestigious Manila Hotel is still preserved as a monument to the man. While obviously of in terest to many people, the hotel treats his for mer parlor and study with respect rather than as a museum, and in terested parties must make in dividual requests to the management in or der to view the rooms.

This writing system was suppressed by the Spanish friars who at tempted to uproot the in digenous Philippine cultures they encountered because they believed them to be backward and unenlightened. In place of what had existed before, the priests substituted religious education, which consisted of stories of saints and liturgical music. For most of the Spanish colonial regime, education was not given or en­ Page 200 couraged in the rural areas, and in a reversal of the policy and practice in its South and Central American colonial administrations, there was no conscious at tempt to teach Spanish to Filipinos. Instead, the friars at tempted to learn the local dialect for daily communication while they celebrated mass in unintelligible Latin. This aspect of Spain’s policy in the Philippines effectively denied the population any knowledge of the colonizer’s language, the reby keeping the natives ignorant and more easily controlled. For most of the nation, the possibility of basic education and literacy was given hope by an educational decree in 1863 that called for the establishment of local schools in every parish of the country. While well in tended, the decree did not create a budget to set up such as school system but left affairs up to the local community and the priest who supervised the school.

The Philippines, thus, has the distinction of having a university older than Harvard in the United States. In addition, a number of secondary schools were founded, in cluding the Ateneo Municipal and the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, as well as the royal college of San Jose and seminaries in Manila, Cebu, and the provincial capital of Vigan in Ilocos Sur on the northwest coast of Luzon. These in stitutions were not, however, in tended for the general education of the native population, but rather for the children of the Spanish in habitants and a limited number of of fspring of mestizos and elite Filipinos. As such, they remained very small in stitutions until the nineteenth century.6 It must be acknowledged that the Spanish reluctance to support a broadbased educational system was a result of their need to control the colony. By the nineteenth century, however, as more and more of successful mestizos and the native elite prospered from an expanding in ternational trade and the in creased commercialization of the country’s hinterlands, these local groups could afford to send their sons to schools in Manila and even to Europe.

The arrival of the United States at the turn of the century revolutionized the country’s in adequate educational system. Schools were opened as soon Page 201 as hostilities subsided, with common soldiers frequently acting as teachers in hastily erected buildings. Unlike their Spanish predecessors, the Americans used education to firmly implant the English language, which would make the task of governing easier and would develop new social patterns to facilitate the eventual realization of democracy and in dependence. By 1901, a structure and budget was in place that created a national education system from elementary schools through teacher’s colleges. In this structure, each province had an of ficial in charge of that government’s educational efforts. Usually, this of ficial was an American. Classrooms were built in every town and many major barrios, and most of the nation’s youth were soon in school. It was not much later that teacher’s colleges began to produce the nation’s first fully trained elementary teachers who fanned out across the country. The University of the Philippines was founded in 1908 as the country’s premier educational in stitution. As the university began to develop its programs, a number of promising Filipinos were sent to graduate school in the United States.

English is still used at the collegiate level and in many private elementary and secondary schools. Whereas as late as the 1970 s, English had been the medium of in struction from grade three on ward, the country’s public school system has since shifted to using the national language of Pilipino while retaining local dialects for the lowest grades of young children who are just socialized into the classroom setting. Though no longer as extensively used as the language of in struction, English is still taught as a second language and the pressure to learn it is very strong. The nation’s media is still heavily in fluenced by English, and Filipinos know that the best jobs go to those with a firm command of the language. By law, education is free and compulsory for children from ages seven through twelve. Filipino parents are keenly aware that a quality education is crucial to their children’s futures, but it isn’t always possible, especially for families living in rural areas where there might only be a grade one through six elementary school or, at best, a poorly furnished community high school. The real problem, then, is effective access to quality education as even the most in terested rural student usually cannot complete a full course of study because of the distance in volved in going on to the next academic level.

The real problem, then, is effective access to quality education as even the most in terested rural student usually cannot complete a full course of study because of the distance in volved in going on to the next academic level. The result is a serious depletion in student ranks from one level to the next. Using statistics from the 1995–1996 academic year, there were 11,504,816 children enrolled in the nation’s 36,800 elementary schools (public and private), but only 4,883,507 students enrolled in the country’s 6,205 secondary schools, which means that only 42.4 percent of the students enrolled in grades one through six will go on to high school. The drop off becomes even more dramatic when in stitutions of higher education are factored into the calculation. In the same year, there were 2,017,972 students at tending 1,286 such in stitutions, which means that only 41.3 percent of high school graduates continue their education and only 17.5 percent of the or iginal elementary students will probably go to college. Again in 1995–1996, the nation graduated 328,120 students from its in stitutions of higher learning, which means that the elementary student has only a 2.9 percent chance of getting a college degree that could be his or her means to break out of a continuous cycle of poverty.8 While the Philippines takes pride in its 94 percent literacy rate and that many of its college graduates are eagerly sought after by in ternational corporations, the fact remains that much more needs to be done to broaden educational opportunities. Another important factor that does not appear in the preceding statistical calculations is the quality of the education that the students actually receive.

A further examination of statistical data confirms what one would expect concerning literacy rate differences between urban and rural areas. Most revealing are the functional literacy rate differences between metro Manila, which scored 92.4 percent, versus those regions of the country in habited by the country’s ethnic minorities. Specifically, the Cordillera administration, which covers the central mountain region of Luzon, had only a 78.6 percent functional literacy rate, while the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao showed 61.2 percent of its population as functionally literate. In fairness, it should be ment ioned that other areas of the country in habited by Christian Filipinos were not that much better than the Cordillera region, and some were actually worse.9 But, these low statistics certainly mitigate against the ability of the country to advance itself in the Page 204 current competitive global economy where a properly educated workforce is a strong point upon which to build for the future. Another factor that is even more difficult to calculate in any analysis of the Philippine educational system is the quality of the schools the mselves.

We know from accounts written by the first Spaniards that the Philippines had a stratified social or der before European contact, and the population was divided between the local leader and a lesser nobility and the majority of the people plus a dependent servile group.12 It also seemed possible to move upward in early Philippine society, but the dynamics of the pre­conquest system cannot be determined precisely, since the Spaniards soon in troduced a rigidity to the in digenous social structure. To facilitate their Page 205 rule, the Spaniards identified a leadership group, generally called the principalia, who were given rights and privileges denied the rest of the population.13 This collaborator class was self­perpetuating, since the new rulers also in troduced the principle of hereditary rights, an alien European concept. The Spanish era also witnessed the in troduction of some new social groups, in cluding the Chinese, who migrated to the colony for economic reasons, and their mixed­blood children who were a product of marriages with local Philippine women. Similarly, many Spaniards also had children by native women, so there soon emerged a class of Spanish mestizos as well. Not surprisingly, the resident Spaniards and mestizos appeared to hold sway during the Iberian regime’s dominance, but their control of the economy was effectively undermined by the Chinese mestizos by the latter decades of the nineteenth century. In the end, the Spaniards only had political power, and they soon lost that to the United States.

In 1997, the metro Manila area was estimated to have 127,873 families living below the poverty line. Meanwhile, the disparity between urban and rural in comes is greater at every level, betraying the concentration of wealth in the cities and the clear advantages urban dwellers enjoy despite their greater costs of living. Simply put, in the nation’s rural areas, the vast majority have to struggle to make ends meet, and farmers continue to live in extreme in debtedness to landlords and money lenders.18 In all cases, whether urban or rural, the impact of poverty is felt most immediately on women and children who are the human face of economic imbalances and in justice.

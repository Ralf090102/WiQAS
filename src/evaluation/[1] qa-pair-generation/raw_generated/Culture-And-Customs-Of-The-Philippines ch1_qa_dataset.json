In Manila, the capital city’s architecture is dominated by modern high­rise of fice buildings and condominiums. Its streets are clogged with cars taking their passengers to many stores that have familiar American chain store names, and the kinds of goods sold in local stores are easily identified thanks to the shop signs, all of which are in English. Though the local population is distinctly Malay (the dominant racial group in the island Southeast Asian nations of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia) in physical appearance, their manner of everyday dress is similar to that in virtually any American town or city, and their open friendship has made Filipino hospitality well known around the world. Filipinos are quick to point out that because of their colonial past they have spent 300 years in a Spanish convent and then fifty more years in Hollywood, so they are very aware of Euro­American culture. The facile observation of the first­time visitor contains some truth. Many Filipinos are literate in English, since it is taught in schools as a second language, and they follow the latest American songs, movies, and novels, all of which are locally available. Philippine newspapers, magazines, and broadcast news devote at least some at tention to American politics and social trends, and many Filipinos have relatives in the “states” and have visited the United States, sometimes frequently. Every year, many Filipinos leave their homes for work overseas where they are valued because of their English proficiency and general sophistication. But, the visitor who stays for more than a brief visit soon discovers that even Western foods do not taste quite like they do back home and that Filipinos really prefer their own foods to Page 2 imported dishes, which are regarded as snacks rather than real food"

But, the visitor who stays for more than a brief visit soon discovers that even Western foods do not taste quite like they do back home and that Filipinos really prefer their own foods to Page 2 imported dishes, which are regarded as snacks rather than real food. It also becomes apparent that personal relationships are conducted in ways that are much closer to Asian rather than Western models. Soon, this comfortable Westernized Asian country becomes remarkably odd and difficult to understand in fundamental ways. The truth is that Filipinos have a strong in digenous Asian culture that has in corporated many external in fluences and refashioned them according to its own standards. This book is in tended to be a bridge between in itial impressions and deeper understandings of the resulting cultural synthesis. The complex combining of cultural elements to create a uniquely Philippine culture is a major theme found in many of the following chapters whether the to pic is architecture, music, literature, religion, family life, or fashion. This exploration of just what it is that constitutes Philippine culture is not only of in terest to the for eign reader, but is also a major concern of Filipinos who must constantly define their national identity in response to for eign in fluences. This chapter looks at the country’s physical reality to determine the geographic and climatic impact of the archipelago on Philippine society. It also identifies the more important groups of Philippine minority peoples, as well as the major dialects and ethnic identities that differentiate various lowland, or majority, Filipinos from each other.

THE PHILIPPINE ARCHIPELAGO, CLIMATE, POPULATION, AGRICULTURE, AND RELIGIOUS COMPOSITION The Philippine archipelago lies about 100 miles to the south of Taiwan and a few nautical miles from its Southeast Asian neighbors to the southwest, Malaysia and Indonesia. To the west is the South China Sea while immediately to the east is the undersea Philippine Trench of the Pacific Ocean, one of the deepest parts of any ocean in the world. The archipelago’s location at the far southeastern edge of Asia has meant that many aspects of the region’s religious and cultural in fluences could be selectively adopted into the pre­existing culture. So, for example, Hinduism and Buddhism left very little impression on the peoples of the Philippines while Islam did not reach the islands until the fourteenth century but was synthesized into the local cultural milieu. Similarly, cultural in fluences from China were taken into the country via the mediation of merchants from that country’s southern provinces and were adopted slowly and selectively. This relative isolation and the Page 3 freedom to pick and choose from other cultures have helped to produce the very unique amalgam that is the Philippines. The archipelago is made up of over 7,100 islands of which only 460 are more than one square mile in area. The rest of the islands are uninhabitable and some disappear at high tide. The country’s major islands in clude, first and for emost, the main island of Luzon that stretches from the far north to Manila and beyond to the southeast via a long arm for ming the Bicol region"

Luzon is ethnically and geographically divided into a number of subregions and is the home to three of the country’s six major language dialects. To the far south is the large island of Mindanao that extends from a southwesterly arm known as the Sulu archipelago up to the main portion of the massive island that is home to an uneasily mixed population of non­Christian tribal groups, in digenous Muslims, and recent Filipino Christian migrants. Mindanao is very diverse geographically with a number of major river basins, gulfs, and bays, and it is home to a number of ethno­linguistic groups. The islands in the center of the country are known as the Visayas and in clude the long thin island of Cebu, which was the 1521 landing spot for Ferdinand Magellan during his exploratory voyage around the world and where he lost his life in a battle with a local chieftain. Later in 1565, Cebu was again the in itial landing area and colonial capital for Spain’s founding expedition under the command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. Today, Cebu is the Philippine’s second largest city and as such is a major port and in dustrial center. Immediately to the west lies the island of Negros (pronounced “Nay­gross” and in Spanish meaning “the dark island”). Though long underpopulated, the island rapidly filled in the nineteenth century when its fertile volcanic soils were tapped to grow sugar cane for a booming in ternational market. The Negros sugar economy still plays a major role in the nation’s economy and supports a number of major cultural activities"

Other major islands in the Visayas in clude Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Masbate, while other major islands of the archipelago in clude Mindoro and Marinduque and the Romblon group, all of which are just south of Luzon and the long island of Palawan, which seems to connect Luzon with the Malaysian state of Sabah to the southwest. The country’s to tal land area is 115,600 square miles, which is slightly smaller than the combined area of the states of New York, Illinois, and Maryland.1 Though impressive, this figure does not convey how large a to tal surface area the country covers, since its islands are divided by substantial bodies of water, which are in corporated within its national boundaries. So, Page 4 it is best to keep in mind that the Philippines stretches about 1,100 miles from north to south and some 650 miles across from east to west. This distance is almost equal to the distance from Duluth to New Orleans and from St. Louis to Washington, D. C., respectively. As well, the archipelago’s irregular coastline stretches for approximately 14,000 miles or about twice that of the continental United States.

Meanwhile, the smaller Subic Bay, west of Manila, has a well­protected harbor and until recently served as the home for a massive U. S. naval facility. Currently, Subic Bay is the port for a large export processing in dustrial zone that is playing a major role in the country’s in dustrialization. Other major ports in clude those of Cebu and Iloilo in the Visayas and Zamboanga and Davao on Mindanao. The easy access to saltwater from most locations in the country, as well as freshwater rivers and lakes, accounts for the amount of fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants in the local diet. The country’s fishing in dustry is largely a small­scale operation of in dividual boat owners whose easy access to a livelihood assures the country of a steady supply of fish. A physical map shows that the archipelago has a number of prominent mountain ranges, many of which are volcanic. On Luzon, the most important ranges are the Central Cordillera in the north, the Zambales mountain chain to the west, the Sierra Madre along the eastern edge, and the Caraballo de Baler mountain chain extending along the southeastern arm of the island. On Mindanao, four distinct mountain ranges divide the island, while the highest peak in the country is Mt. Apo west of the city of Davao with an elevation of 9,692 feet.

All of these mountains and volcanos are a part of the so­called Pacific Ring of Fire, a line of volcanic and seismic activity that occasionally causes great destruction. In the past century and a half, the Philippines has experienced three particularly severe earthquakes, in 1863, 1937, and 1968, as well as many hundreds of lesser quakes and tremors. The Philippines has a tropical climate that averages eighty degrees Fahrenheit, though in terior valleys and the leeward sides of the islands have warmer temperatures than the windward coasts, whose temperatures are moderated. Meanwhile, mountain areas can be substantially cooler such that Page 5 light sweaters are required in the winter months. It was for this climatic reason that the U. S. colonial government built a summer capital in the town of Baguio in the central Cordillera Highlands in the early years of its rule. So desperate were the American of ficials to escape Manila’s oppressive summer heat that they had construction crews cut a steep and winding road along the very face of the Cordillera’s mountains. That road is still used to day and of fers travelers breathtaking scenic views from bus and car windows, while vehicle tires come dangerously close to the edges of steep cliffs along the narrow roadway.

The rather idyllic temperatures of winter become steadily hotter as the winds shift from the northeast, bringing dry conditions and the rmometer readings that reach their zenith in late April and May. During these hot months, schools are on summer break until early June when returning rains make going to school bearable again. The annual rains bring more than relief from the heat: They are critical for the nation’s rice crop. At the first rain, farmers across the country prepare seedbeds, plow, and harrow the hardened soil and repair irrigation canals and the dikes of the rice paddies. Since the development of high­yielding hybrid seeds in the late 1960 s by the International Rice Research Institute, located in Los Banos, Laguna, a short drive southeast of Manila, the nation’s farmers have shifted from low­yielding native varieties to high­yielding hybrids. The country is now self­sufficient in this basic grain. In addition to rice, corn is raised in some of the Visayan Islands and Mindanao where the hardened grains are pulverized and mixed with rice or are consumed as a substitute for rice. The annual rains are also crucial for sugar grown on Negros Island and in provinces north and south of Manila. Meanwhile, the banana­like abaca plant, which produces high­grade natural cordage and coconuts, is grown in the Bicol region and depends on the annual rainfall.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the population was only one­tenth its present size and stood at just slightly more than seven and a half million.

The Bicol region is also solidly Roman Catholic and well known for supporting vibrant regional arts. If the stereotype of the Ilocano is one of hardworking frugality, the Visayan is the archetypal opposite. The abundant marine resources and rich volcanic soils of the central islands has helped to produce a culture that values music, fun, and gregarious personal relations.

HISTORY Pre­Contact Philippines The diverse nature of the Philippine population, from the pygmy “negritos,” scattered throughout the archipelago, to the peoples who compose the numerous non­ Christian national minorities, to the majority lowland Filipinos, shows that the islands have always hosted immigrant groups. Exactly when these different peoples arrived and from where they or iginated is open to question. The oldest archeological evidence of human habitation in the Philippines is a 22,000­year­old skull found in 1962 on the island of Palawan. Much earlier fossil remains dating as far back as 300,000 to one million years ago have been found on the island of Java in Indonesia.

Although Manila was won and protected by Spanish arms, the rationale for the colony’s existence was not simply military and strategic. Spain hoped to secure a source of spices as rich as that controlled by the Portuguese in the nearby “spice islands” in present­day Indonesia. While these hopes were never realized, Manila’s port in stead began to serve as a conduit for the “galleon trade” that exchanged Mexican silver and gold for goods from south China. A special area of the city, the Parian, was set aside for the city’s growing Chinese merchant population, which was for bidden to venture beyond the city. This restriction was imposed for both commercial and strategic reasons, since it was in tended to limit Chinese in fluence among the native population.

The missionary priests, commonly referred to as friars, brought the dispersed native population into to wns so they would be within the sound of church bells and could receive religious in struction. To support their work, the religious or ders had an annual subsidy from the Spanish crown, and in exchange, the local padre (priest) served as the government’s representative overseeing municipal affairs.

The prosperity of the American period also witnessed the beginnings of a true Filipino middle class even if it was only a small percentage of the overall population. The American impact was especially strong on Philippine cultural life. Educators from the United States designed the country’s educational system that even to day still follows the basic patterns they laid down, in cluding the use of English as the principle language for education, business, and government. Soon widespread knowledge of English facilitated the in trusion of popular American culture into the colony. The earliest Americans brought vaudeville and musical the ater to the Philippines; later came Hollywood movies and dance crazes, while popular songs flooded an eager Philippine market. The American in fluence also spread to a variety of other aspects of culture in cluding popular dress, art, and architecture such that, at its height, American in fluence seemed more likely to eliminate all aspects of Filipino culture than had the efforts of the Spanish friars, who had controlled the country for hundreds of years.

Despite the American period’s general prosperity, new cultural in fluences, and political advances, the era did not witness a significant narrowing of the social divide between rich and poor.

The times favored Ramos’s economic development agenda as the early years of his administration coincided with the dramatic growth years of the Asian economy. The Philippine’s growth rates picked up dramatically, even though some discordant voices warned of the unhealthy nature of the country’s economic development policies.22 Still, the collapse of the Asian growth bubble in the summer and fall of 1997 did not affect the Philippines as dramatically as it did neighboring Thailand and Indonesia, but the downturn was enough to undercut most of the progress of Ramos’s first four years in of fice. The 1998 election witnessed a fundamental change in the political landscape with the election of the popular Joseph Estrada, who swept into of fice thanks to a huge majority of the country’s poor who voted for him in record numbers. Before entering politics, Estrada was a popular movie star whose roles saw him as the friend of the downtrodden, and he parlayed that image into unbeatable political capital. Unfortunately, the new president quickly committed a number of errors that resulted in the rapid erosion of his popularity. Even before taking of fice, Estrada announced that he would allow the remains of for mer president Marcos to be buried in the country’s hero’s cemetery. This proposal so enraged the country that the plan was eventually dropped. Once in of fice the Estrada administration did virtually nothing for the poor who swept him into of fice, negotiations with communist in surgents stalled, and talks with Muslim rebels collapsed when Estrada or dered the military to seize Muslim rebel bases. Most distressing to many Filipinos was the return of many of Marcos’s for mer “cronys” to positions of in fluence"

Most distressing to many Filipinos was the return of many of Marcos’s for mer “cronys” to positions of in fluence. Estrada also pushed for a new constitutional convention, which concerned many people who feared that he might use such a convention to destroy the legal safeguards Aquino put into place to prevent a future power grab. In 1999, demonstrators led by Cory Aquino and Archbishop Sin again took to the streets amidst in creased political polarization. The low point of the Estrada administration was reached in the fall of 2000 when he and one of his political cronys, Governor Chavit Singson of Ilocos Norte province, had a falling out. Singson the reupon presented testimony and documents showing that Estrada received hundreds of millions of pesos in bribes from national gambling syndicates and was the recipient of many more millions of diverted tax revenues. In addition, substantial in vestigative reports showed that the president and his family and some women friends had recently moved into some of the largest mansions in the country. In November, articles of impeachment were passed by the Philippine House of Representatives and sent Page 26 to the Senate for full impeachment proceedings. Meanwhile, anti­Estrada demonstrations grew larger and more vocal in their demand for his resignation, even as members of his cabinet resigned their positions. Despite the gravity of the charges against him, Estrada had a sufficient bloc of supporters in the Senate to defeat the charges against him, but events did not follow their expected course.

Suddenly, the legal proceedings lost all credibility, and hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in metro Manila and throughout the country took to the streets once again as they had in 1986. The Philippine president was swiftly deserted by his cabinet and the armed for ces who joined the “People Power II” throngs. The drama ended in a few days when the Philippine Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant and Vice President Gloria Macapagal­Arryo was sworn into of fice. Though pleased with the outcome of the recent popular movement, thoughtful Filipinos are questioning their culture’s political values and are seeking a new set of political values that will make a future “People Power III” unnecessary.23 NOTES 1.

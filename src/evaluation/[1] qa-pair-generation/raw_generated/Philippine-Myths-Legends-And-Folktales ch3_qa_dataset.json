      "context": "The Tale of Pakungo-adipen PAKUNGO-ADIPEN was a lazy man. The only thing he loved to do was lie down in bed all day long. But for one reason or another he had all the luck, as this Ilocano tale will prove to you. He was sound alseep one day when he heard a voice saying, “Pakungo-adipen, please shoot me down. Pakungo-adipen, please shoot me down.” He was awakened but did not mind the voice. “Pakungo-adipen, do please shoot me down,” said the voice. “Pakungo-adipen, do please shoot me down.” Reluctantly Pakungo-adipen opened one eye and saw a little bird perched on a nearby tree. “No. I am too tired to work,” replied Pakungo-adipen and went back to sleep. “Pakungo-adipen, do please shoot me down,” repeated the bird. “Pakungo-adipen, do please shoot me down.” Finally Pakungo-adipen rose, much annoyed at having to get out of bed. He picked up his bow and arrow, aimed, and shot down the bird. Then he went back to bed, leaving the bird where it fell. Hardly had he closed his eyes when the bird spoke again and said: “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up. Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up.” He heard it but did not move. “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up,” the bird re- peated. “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up.” “I’m too busy getting some sleep to come and pick you up,” muttered Pakungo-adipen. “I won't get up just to pick up a dead bird.” 57 “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up,” repeated the bird. “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up.” At last Pakungo-adipen lost his temper and said, “You asked me to shoot you down, I shot you down. Now do you expect me to come and pick you up, too?” “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up,” repeated the bird. “Pakungo-adipen, please pick me up.” At last Pakungo-adipen got up, picked up the bird, and to ssed it into the kitchen. “Now I can get me a good, unbroken sleep,” sighed he, lying down and falling asleep right away. But the bird spoke again and said, “Pakungo-adipen, please dress me and cook me"

      "question": "What did Pakungo-adipen do to the bird after it asked him to cook it?",
      "answer": "He dressed the bird, cut it up, and left it boiling in a pot.",
      "cultural_golden_answer": "In Filipino culture, this passage highlights the importance of respecting the requests of others, even if they seem absurd. Pakungo-adipen's actions show how he initially complies with the bird's demands, but eventually refuses to put the cooked bird on the floor and cover it with a sheet. This theme is reminiscent of traditional Filipino values such as bayanihan (solidarity) and pakikisama (social harmony), which emphasize mutual respect and cooperation.",

Will it never shut its mouth?” He refused to get out of bed. “Pakungo-adipen, please dress me and cook me,” re- peated the bird. “Pakungo-adipen, please dress me and cook me.” “Indeed, what kind of bird is this?” said he. “It asked me to shoot it down; I shot it down. It asked me to pick it up; I picked it up. Now it asks me to dress it and cook it, too!” But he rose with great reluctance, dressed the bird, cut it up, and left it boiling in a pot. Then he went back to sleep. When the bird was finally cooked, it said, “Pakungo- adipen, please put me on the floor and cover me witha sheet.

You wanted to be shot down, and shoot you down I did. You wanted to be picked up, and pick you up I did. You wanted to be dressed and cooked, and dress you and cook you I did.

When he had done, he sighed a long sigh and said, “Now at last I can enjoy my sleep!” But by and by he heard a sweet voice saying, “Pakungo- adipen, please uncover me. Pakungo-adipen, please un- cover me.” Pakungo-adipen did not move. He closed his eyes tight and was soon snoring—for he enjoyed his sleep better when he snored. “Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me,” the sweet voice said again. “Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me. Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me.” So Pakungo-adipen got up, stamped on the floor, and said: “What bird or devil are you? You asked to be shot down; I shot you down. You asked to be picked up; I picked you up. You asked to be dressed and cooked; I dressed and cooked you. You asked to be put on the floor and covered with a sheet; I put you on the floor and cov- ered you witha sheet. And now you expect me to come and uncover you again? No, I will do nothing of the sort! I am too busy getting me a good sleep!” So saying, he went back to bed and was soon snoring again. But the voice did not stop. It continued repeating: “Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me. Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me. Pakungo-adipen, please uncover me.” 59 “Oh, I will never have peace with this bird!” moaned Pakungo-adipen, getting up at last"

He staggered to where he had covered the bird on the floor, pulled off the sheet, and lo and behold!—a strange and delightful sight met his eyes. For there on the floor lay, not the bird, cooked, dressed, or shot. There on the floor lay no bird at all. There on the floor lay the most beautiful princess you ever saw or heard of. She opened her eyes, smiled, and extended her arms to Pakungo-adipen. And so surprised was Pakungo- adipen that he quite for got to go back to sleep but took her in his arms and, to put a tail to my tale, married her. I regret that I really do not know whether Pakungo- adipen and the princess led a happy married life. If you should press me for an answer, I should say that they probably did, for with such a sweet wife in his home, Pakungo-adipen must have learned to be ashamed to sleep too much. I have very little doubt that with such a sweet wife, Pakungo-adipen must have learned to be hard- working and wide-awake. But then that’s only my guess. 60 The Man and the Lizard THIS TALE HAPPENED long, long ago, when the Mona, the first parents of mankind, according to the Bagobos of Davao, still lived on earth. At that time there lived a man and his wife, and one day the man took his snares and headed for the wcods. He sought the trails of the wild chickens and there set his snares in such a way that when the wild fowls came hurrying along in search of food, they would get caught. The following day he returned to the woods and found a lizard caught by one of his snares. “I’ll make this lizard carry my things home and then be killed by my wife,” thought he"

The following day he returned to the woods and found a lizard caught by one of his snares. “I’ll make this lizard carry my things home and then be killed by my wife,” thought he. So he set the lizard free, gave him his bolo and his carrying-basket, and said: “Hurry along to my house, lizard, and take this bolo and this basket to my good wife.” “Yes, my good master,” replied the lizard and scurried off. Now the lizard knew that people liked to eat his flesh for dinner. “I do not want to fool the man,” he told himself, “but neither do I want to be his dinner.” So, as soon as he was safely hidden from view, he crept from the trail and climbed up a tree standing beside a stream. The man visited his other snares but saw only loose feathers there. He did not know that the lizard had eaten 61 up the wild chickens caught in the snares before he was himself snared. “T have little luck to day,” thought the man. “But any- way I shall have the lizard for dinner.” He walked home and, “Wife, let’s have dinner, for 1 am very hungry,” he said as he climbed up the ladder. “Come right in,” his wife replied. “Dinner is ready.” The man sat down to eat but saw no lizard meat. “Where's the lizard?” he asked. “Get him out of the pot and let’s eat him.” “What lizard?” “The lizard that I sent to you, of course.” “Sent to me!” “I sent you a lizard this morning,” the man explained. “Did you not cook him?” “Whom did you ask to bring the lizard to me?” “T asked the lizard himself. My snare caught the lizard. I asked him to bring you my bolo and my carrying-basket. But stop joking, Wife. Where are my basket and my bolo, and where is the lizard?” “If you are joking, Iam not!” she said. “If you sent the lizard to me as you say, of course he never came"

I must go back and catch that lizard. He will pay dearly for running off just like that— and with my bolo and my basket too!” The man walked back into the woods and soon found the lizard’s tracks. He followed the tracks until he came to the stream. Looking in the water, he saw the lizard’s reflection there. “Ah, there you are!” he exclaimed. “Now I will get you!” He jumped into the water to catch the lizard. He 62 made a big splash, and so the lizard’s reflection disap- peared. The man returned ‘: the bank and watched for it to reappear. “That lizard is in. ced tricky,” he muttered. By and by the water became still and the lizard’s image reappeared in it. “There he is!” said the man, leaping into the water, but of course he did not catch the lizard. When he was tired out, he went home and told his wife what happened. “I almost got him,” he said. “But he is very slippery.” “I would like to see this lizard myself,” said she. “Let’s go and look for him.” They walked to the stream and he pointed at the lizard’s image in the water. “There he is!” he said. She looked into the water once and then up into the tree. “Why, there is your lizard, laughing at you!” she said, pointing up. The man saw the lizard up in the tree. “Yes, in deed!” he said"

He covered his cart with black cloth, and in the evening when no one was around, pushed the cart to the side of a road hard by the for est. He set up candles around the cart and lighted them. Then he wrapped himself in a shroud, climbed into the cart, and lay still. Now the people in that place believed that the dead had the power to give good luck. As Juan lay in the cart, along came a band of robbers from the for est. They saw Juan, and walked to him, and prayed: “O dead one, grant that we shall be lucky in our ven- ture:“ Then they went to plunder a rich man in the town. They succeeded in carrying off his money bags and were very grateful to the corpse for their good for tune.

On their way back to the for est they knelt before Juan’s cart again. “Grant that we shall always be as lucky as we have been to night,” said they. Then they started to divide the gold. “I must get the largest bag of all,” said one. “My work | was the hardest. I had to find out who was the richest man in the town.” 64 “It is | who must get the biggest share,” replied another. “I found out where the rich man hid his gold.” “But it was I who showed you how to get the bags,” said the third. “I must have the largest share.” The other robbers made similar demands, and soon they were ready to fight each other over the money. Then their captain became very angry. “This corpse is the cause of our quarrel,” he said. “If it had not given us such good luck, we would not be quarreling now. We must destroy the corpse so that we may have peace.” So saying, he drew his sword and aimed it at Juan’s breast. Juan of course heard him. Seeing the captain raise his sword, he jumped up in great fright. The robbers saw him jump and thought he was a ghost. They were so scared that they fled in all directions with out stopping to pick up the bags of gold. Juan got down, put the bags of money in the cart, and pushed the cart home. From then on he lived like a man of great wealth, and he bought a big house and hired many servants. Pedro, Juan‘s neighbor, saw Juan’s sudden prosperity and paid him a visit. “How did you come by so much wealth, my good neighbor?” Pedro asked. “Only a few days ago you were poor, and now you are as rich as a king. 65 Did you find a buried treasure?” “T found a treasure, all right,” replied Juan. “Where?” “Yl tell you,” Juan said. “I took my cart near the woods and covered it with black cloth.

He set up candles around the cart, climbed on, and lay still. “God will give me more money than He gave Juan,” Pedro thought. “Juan only went to the woods. I came directly into God’s house.” By and by the sacristan entered the church to ring the 66 evening bell. He saw the cart, looked into it, and was much surprised. He had not rung the bell to admit a dead man and yet here was a bier with a corpse on it! He fled from the church, ran to the convent, and told the priest what he had seen. “It’s a miracle!” the sacristan said. “You must be dreaming,” said the priest. “Come down and see for yourself, Father!” the sacristan replied. They went in side the church, and when the priest saw Pedro lying on the cart, “Go and fetch the grave-digger,” he told the sacristan, “and we shall bury the corpse.” Pedro heard him and became alarmed, for of course he did not want to be buried. So he jumped off the cart and ran away. The priest and the sacristan saw him run away and were even more frightened than Pedro was.

They were both too fond of the fermented juice of sugar cane called basi. “Pari!” yawned Oppong to Angkil late one morning, waking up. “I have thought of an excellent way to make money.” “Tell me about it, Pari,” Angkil replied, yawning from his window. “We shall go to town and peddle basi.” “But where is the basi?” asked Angkii. “You and I have drunk all the basi in the barrio.” “We shall go to the other barrios and buy all the basi we can get.” “And where shall we get the money to buy the basi?” “We shall sell our carabaos and return to our native village with double the money we get for them,” said Oppong. Angkil agreed and so they sold their carabaos cheap. With the money Oppong and Angkil bought all the basi found in the neighboring barrios. This they poured into a bayeng-yeng, or long bamboo tube, which Oppong carried across his shoulder. They started out for town late in the afternoon just as soon as the heat of the sun had left the road. As they 68 walked along they shouted, “Basi! Who will buy wonderful basi? Who will buy basi that drives all cares away?” The bayeng-yeng was quite heavy and so they took turns in carrying it. Darkness had fallen over the landscape before an old woman living by the roadside stopped them and asked for a bowl of basi.

Finally they agreed that whoever happened to be carrying the bayeng- yeng when a sale was made should hold the money from that sale and hand over the bayeng-yeng to the other. Oppong took the money and put it in his pocket. They decided to continue traveling in the dark so that they might reach town by early morning, when people drink much basi to warm their stomachs. They walked and walked until at last they grew tired and decided to rest. “Pari,” said Oppong to Angkil, who happened to be holding the bayeng-yeng at the time, “can you sell me some of the basi?” “I don’t see why not, Pari,” replied Angkil. “How much will you buy?” “Oh, just a bowl.” Angkil filled the bowl and Oppong quaffed the basi, handing the old woman’s coin to Angkil and reluctantly taking the bayeng-yeng from his friend. 69 Then they resumed their journey. After a while Angkil said, “Pari, please sell me some of the basi, too.” “Certainly,” replied Oppong. “How much?” “No more than you drank, I suppose. Just a bowl.” Oppong filled the bowl and Angkil quaffed the wine. Then the coin changed hands and Angkil shouldered the bayeng-yeng. They had not walked much farther when Oppong said, “Pari, some basi, please.” “A bowl of it, Pari?” asked Angkil, pleased to be re- lieved of the bayeng-yeng so soon. “Yes, just a bowl,” said Oppong. Their stops for a drink of the basi became more and more frequent. At last the two friends just sat down at the roadside pouring the basi for each other. Before long they had sold and drunk all the basi between the mselves. Then they staggered to a lighted hut near by. “Let’s go over there and count the money we got for the basi,” they said. 70"

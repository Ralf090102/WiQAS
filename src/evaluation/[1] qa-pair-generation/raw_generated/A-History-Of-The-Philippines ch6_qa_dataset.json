      "context": "6. THE REPUBLIC: THE STRONGMAN AND THE HOUSEWIFE, 1972-1992 “You will probably ask me: will I also apply [land reform] to my family’s Hacienda Luisita. My answer is yes; although sugar land is not covered by the land reform law, I shall sit down with my family to explore how the twin goals of maximum productivity and dispersal of ownership and benefits can be exemplified for the rest of the nation in Hacienda Luisita.” —Corazon C. Aquino on land reform while campaigning in Mindanao, January 16, 1986 M ARTIAL L AW: T HE N EW S OCIETY S ENATOR B ENIGNO A QUINO J R., OR N INOY, AS HE LIKED TO BE called by friends and followers, was President Marcos’s most charismatic opponent and likely to be the central figure for above-ground opposition to martial law. From the Central Luzon province of Tarlac, he was the son of the late Senator Benigno Aquino, who had served with José Laurel in the Japanese-controlled Philippine government during World War II. The younger Aquino was something of a wunderkind, having worked as a correspondent in the Korean War for the Manila Chronicle at the age of seventeen. At twenty-one, he took on a job as an adviser to then Defense Secretary Magsaysay and when the latter was elected president, acted as his emissary to Luis Taruc. After in tense negotiations, the Huk chief agreed to an unconditional surrender. Aquino rose through the political ranks impressively, being elected as mayor of his hometown at the age of twenty-two, the youngest ever in the country’s history, as well as being the youngest elected senator later on. He would undoubtedly have been the Liberal Party candidate for president in the 1973 presidential elections, running against Marcos’s Nacionalista Party standard bearer, had not the imposition of martial law and one man’s megalomaniacal ambitions derailed the nation’s normal political processes for a decade and a half. Ninoy was arrested and charged with conspiring against the government, and with illegal possession of firearms. In late 1977, a military tribunal sentenced him to death, a sentence that was immediately suspended as the regime had no desire to canonize its most celebrated prisoner. Aquino would be imprisoned for nearly eight years before being allowed in 1980 to fly with his wife Corazon and children to the U. S. for heart surgery, having suffered a heart at tack two months before. Another well-known opposition senator, Senator José Diokno, was arrested as well. Along with Aquino, Diokno had been one of the more persistent and vocal critics of the Marcos government. Older than Aquino, Diokno had served as justice secretary under President Macapagal and had made a number of powerful enemies in his in vestigations of corruption, for which he was relieved—a sure sign he was doing his job. Upon his release, Senator Diokno would go on to become a fearless champion of human rights during the repressive years of dictatorial rule. Both senators charged that the spate of bombings (mostly harmless, except for those at Plaza Miranda) and the in cessant harping on the in ternal Communist threat were government tactics meant to create the right circumstances under which martial law could be imposed. A week before the fake ambush on Defense Secretary Enrile, and the subsequent declaration of martial law, Aquino laid bare before the Senate “Oplan Saggitarius,” that he said had been leaked to him by his confidential sources. According to Aquino, “Saggitarius” had been prepared by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) at the behest of the president, by which a series of provocative in cidents would be stage-managed so the government could blame violent anti-government factions, and thus justify declaring a state of emergency. Marcos dismissed the accusation as politically motivated and promised that he would seek Senate counsel before such a drastic step were taken. No such counsel was sought when he did impose martial law. In a press release issued by the president’s of fice on that fateful date, Marcos stated that martial law’s immediate aim was to “eliminate the threat of a violent overthrow of our Republic.” He added that reform was imperative, and that he was determined to clean up “government of its corrupt and sterile elements,” as well as undertake “the liquidation of criminal syndicates and the systematic development of the economy.” Presumably martial law was meant to restore law and or der and shore up public trust and confidence in the government’s ability to ensure a productive, peaceful, and stable civil state. But in fact, the of fice of the Philippine president had enough constitutional authority to have the laws enforced strictly, in cluding disbanding the numerous private militias in the provinces that prominent politicians and powerful businessmen employed for security and the in timidation of rivals. Having their own hired guns also made it easier to mock the rule of law and get away with it. The availability of firearms in the immediate aftermath of World War II and the failure of political will in the central government all but encouraged the emergence of clan-based warlords. Martial law wasn’t necessary to achieve these goals, but clearly Marcos needed a legitimate reason to stay on in power—the constitution limited a president to two terms. Orchestrating an at mosphere of lawlessness enabled him to proclaim martial law. He gave the proposed makeover of the country the rather grandiose title of “The New Society,” a riff on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society,” and he created the Kilusan Bagong Lipunan, or New Society Movement. Marcos envisioned a reinvigorated nation-state that would navigate its way between the violent methods of both left- and right-wing extremists. The path chosen by the New Society would be what Marcos termed “constitutional authoritarianism”: by relying on the powers granted to him by the constitution (through the use of its state of emergency provision) the government would undercut the extremists and break up the country’s entrenched oligarchy controlling most of the country’s resources and wealth. Thus, the New Society would ensure a more equitable distribution of in come and eliminate a major cause of unrest among the population. This in turn would weaken the left’s critique of a ruling dispensation favoring the privileged few over the masses. Nevertheless, the underground left would keep hammering at the state and the refore, the threat of a Communist takeover had to be met firmly, through an in crease in the military’s strength; the suspension of civil liberties (that the New Society portrayed as being routinely abused by anti-government activists); a crackdown on groups that regularly challenged the establishment, such as labor unions, student activists, peasant or ganizations, and even journalists; and the confiscation of unregistered firearms along with the dissolution of private armies"

A curfew was imposed and military and police checkpoints set up in many parts of the country, especially in and around Metro Manila. In its drive to restore an at mosphere of peace and or der, the government claimed to have confiscated half a million firearms. At the outset, civil society grudgingly accepted limits on its liberties. Traffic rules were obeyed, garbage collected, street crime was down, and petty government bureaucrats, mirabile dictu, seemed more conscientious in the performance of their duties and not so eager to solicit bribes. To for mulate the the or etical and operative principles along which the New Society would be constructed, Marcos relied heavily on technocrats, more so than any previous administration. It was also a public relations ploy, as the jargon of the technocracy imparted to government policies a veneer of professionalism and legitimacy. Yet, in one respect, Marcos was exactly like most other dictators: he and his wife eagerly sought to portray the mselves as saviors of an embattled country. They had a predilection for casting the mselves in Philippine mythological terms: He was Malakas (Strength) and she was Maganda (Beauty), alluding to the Philippine creation myth, in which the first man and woman emerged simultaneously from a grove of bamboo as equal partners, fully for med and perfect. In one painting, Ferdinand, Imelda, and their children are portrayed as though they were a royal family. In addition, Ferdinand authored several ghostwritten books, among them Progress and Martial Law and The New Philippine Republic: A Third World Approach to Democracy. As early as 1965 he commissioned the film biography Iginuhit ng Tadhana ( Destined by Fate ), before commissioning Maharlika, which starred the ill-fated Dovie Beams. As dictator, he or dered a gigantic bust of himself to be set up on a mountainside, à la Mt. Rushmore, in northern Luzon’s Cordilleras, on land for cibly taken from an in digenous tribe. He also relied on an in creasingly compliant Constitutional Convention, which was convened in 1971 but whose proceedings were in terrupted by martial law. The Con-Con, as it was known, was meant to draft a new law of the land that would replace the colonial-era 1935 constitution. When it resumed its deliberations after the imposition of martial law, the convention—through being bullied and manipulated by Marcos partisans—was transformed into a rubber stamp for Marcos’s legislative agenda, a principal objective being to convert the current system of government into a parliamentary one, thus allowing him to stay in power beyond 1973, when his second and last term was to end. At his behest, his followers in the convention manipulated the drafting of the constitution so it extended martial law, authorized rule by decree, and the or etically allowed him to be both prime minister and president. The 1973 constitution was ratified through spurious citizens’ assemblies, dominated by Marcos loyalists, rather than through a national referendum. It was a constitution created, in short, to serve the needs of one man rather than the nation. Uncle Sam’s Blessing In the Philippine political world, how far one rises nationally is of ten linked to how well one cultivates, or is seen to cultivate, ties with Washington—a perception founded on colonial-era realities. It was automatically assumed that something as momentous as martial law had the support, albeit in direct, of the United States. True enough: hardly the type to raise a fuss over ethical conduct, embroiled as it was in the beginnings of the Watergate scandal that would ultimately force President Nixon to resign in 1974 in or der to avoid impeachment, the U. S. government continued to support Marcos. Besides, with the war in Vietnam proving to be disastrous for the United States, resulting in its with drawal in 1975, having a staunch anti-Communist ally, one that moreover hosted two of the largest U. S. bases in the world, assumed even more importance. Given that Henry Kissinger—Nixon’s national security adviser and later secretary of state and the refore the prime architect of Nixon’s for eign policy— was a firm believer in realpolitik, Marcos was pretty confident of U. S. support. For Marcos too was a master at playing the game of realpolitik, and he knew that as long as the United States’s economic and military in terests—its bases and in vestments in the archipelago—were left untouched, then it would be business as usual. Following a predictable script, Marcos could, and did, sound all the right nationalist notes and still act as a subaltern of the United States. The wily strongman even committed a contingent of Philippine troops to Vietnam, the Philippine Civic Action Group, or PHILCAG, early in his first term. Consisting of an engineering battalion and medical and rural development teams, the 1,350- strong outfit worked on non-combat missions, mainly civic projects. For all its rhetoric about democracy and the rule of law, the United States had almost always supported dictatorial regimes that were allied with U. S. strategic in terests. The 1970 s proved to be a golden decade for U. S.-backed strongman rule. The 1973 coup by General Augusto Pinochet that to ppled the democratically elected government of left-leaning Salvador Allende in Chile had the blessings of Washington. So did General Park Chung-hee in South Korea, Suharto in Indonesia, the military junta in Argentina, and the Shah in Iran. With Kissinger and Nixon in control of American for eign policy, America’s support for dictators in creased, in direct proportion to diminishing concern for democracy"

With Kissinger and Nixon in control of American for eign policy, America’s support for dictators in creased, in direct proportion to diminishing concern for democracy. American businessmen in the Philippines were more effusive in their support of constitutional authoritarianism. The American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, headed by a William Mitchell, sent the president a congratulatory telegram on September 27, 1972, just five days after the state of emergency had been declared: “The American Chamber of Commerce wishes you every success in your endeavors to restore peace and or der, business confidence, economic growth and the well being of the Filipino people and nation. We assure you of our confidence and cooperation in achieving these objectives. We are communicating these feelings to our associates and affiliates in the United States.” A 1973 study conducted by the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U. S. and meant for its in vestors who were concerned with U. S. corporate responsibility abroad, made it clear why the American Chamber of Commerce was so effusive. In 1971, the year preceding the declaration of martial law, 47 U. S. corporations were among the top 200 Philippine corporations and accounted for close to 32 percent average in to tal sales, in come, assets, and equity, a percentage that in creased to approximately 40 percent when considering only the top thirty-five. Among the 47 were the multinationals Caltex, Exxon, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi Co, Ford, Union Carbide, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, and Del Monte Corporation. (The Del Monte pineapple plantation in Mindanao coincidentally occupies 20,000 hectares, or 44,000 acres, of prime agricultural land that has never been subject to land reform.) One immediate result of Marcos’s grab for power was the substantial in crease in military aid from the Pentagon. Under the U. S. Military Assistance Program, in place since 1947, aid in creased dramatically, from $80.8 million in the four years prior to martial law, to more than twice that—$166.3 million in the succeeding four years. Clearly not coincidental, this in crease signaled to the Marcos regime that the Pentagon was willing to help in countering the Communist threat that martial law was supposed to address. Too, the aid bolstered the case for keeping U. S. bases on Philippine soil. But the U. S. State Department’s own assessment of Marcos and martial law was decidedly more somber, with a report stating “that martial law was not necessary to deal with the country’s problems, which have in fact been considerably aggravated by Marcos’s corrupt political style; that based on his record of ruthless self-aggrandizement he cannot necessarily be counted on to implement significant reforms.” Marcos’s dictatorial rule exposed the darkness at the heart of U. S. for eign policy: as had been shown repeatedly in the past, in spite of the rhetoric, democracy was hardly the most important issue for the U. S. government when it came to its client states. Paramount were its economic and security in terests. Marcos played the role of nationalist very well, but he was still “America’s boy.” The United States embassy seemed to have no doubts about Marcos, as it did about his opponents. It went along with martial law, convinced that Marcos would protect American in terests. If martial law meant taking liberties with the people’s own liberties, so be it. Even as economic conditions and the state of human rights deteriorated over the course of twenty years of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos’s rule—and Imelda was as much a ruler as her husband the longer they remained in power, hence the reference to the partnership as a “conjugal dictatorship”—five successive U. S. presidents supported the Marcoses with little to no restraint exercised: Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan. Even when President Carter (1977-1980) emphasized human rights, it was more lip service than anything substantial when it came to the Philippines. U. S. aid flowed as before, and beyond some cosmetic changes, the Marcos regime knew it could continue on its repressive course. Under President Ronald Reagan (1981-88), who had as governor of California and with Nancy at his side at tended the in auguration of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1969, personal relations between the White House and Malacañang dramatically improved, to the dismay of critics of the Marcoses both domestically and abroad. Marcos’s brand of constitutional authoritarianism fit perfectly with the for eign policy principles enunciated by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s neoconservative for eign-policy adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, who was fiercely anti-communist and who believed in supporting repressive regimes as long these regimes went along with U. S. policies. Kirkpatrick’s views dismayed U. S. liberals who were shocked, shocked, that their government would endorse another government’s routine violations of its citizens’ most fundamental rights. Reagan’s support for the Marcoses was demonstrated most vividly when, on the occasion of his visit to Manila in 1981, Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush to asted Marcos by saying with a straight face, “We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process.” The or dinary Filipino would have been bewildered by such a compliment. Bush may have been referring in directly to Marcos’s having lifted martial law on January 17, 1981, but by then Marcos had the mechanisms in place to maintain all the control he needed. His powers were as broad as ever: Amendment Six to the 1973 Constitution in stitutionalized one-man rule over the nation. With at least 1,000 decrees issued, the dictator could shape the different facets of Philippine society, whether this was the economy or the military, however he saw fit"

With at least 1,000 decrees issued, the dictator could shape the different facets of Philippine society, whether this was the economy or the military, however he saw fit. And in the elections held in June of 1981, which marked a return to the presidential system (but this time a system that in cluded the post of prime minister), Marcos won with 86 percent of the vote. With mainstream opposition parties boycotting the elections and with the regime controlling the electoral machinery as well as the press, the elections simply furnished Marcos’s prolonged stay in of fice with a legal veneer. Imelda: Holding Up Half of Heaven In 1954, she started out as the naïve wife of a brilliant politician, but by the time of martial law, Imelda had, through conscious determination and psychiatric help in New York City, remade herself into a powerful national figure. With martial law she metamorphosed into more than just a ceremonial First Lady. She had emerged a steel but terfly, as many called her simultaneously in awe and derision. Thus, the commonplace reference to His and Hers governments was right on target. She was no longer the darling of the masses who beat up the Beatles for turning down her in vitation to lunch at Malacañang. That hostility was made manifest on December 7, 1972, less than three months after martial law had been declared, when an assailant tried to stab her at a public event. The First Lady sustained cuts to her arms but survived the at tempt. The would-be assassin, Carlito Dimahilig, of whom nothing seems to be known, was shot to death by her security detail. In his Presidential Decree 731, on June 7, 1975, Ferdinand Marcos made Imelda head of the commission that would exercise power in the event of his death or in capacitation. He also appointed her governor of the newly created Metropolitan Manila District, a merger of four cities—in cluding the country’s two largest, Manila and Quezon City—and seven to wns. In 1978, not surprisingly, she won a seat in the Batasan Pambansa, or National Assembly. And that same year, she was named Minister of Human Settlements, a mega- agency with practically unlimited resources, endowing her with even more power as a dispenser of pork. She also served as the regime’s roving ambassador, moving easily from Egypt and Bolivia to China and Cuba. Imelda traveled with a large entourage, consisting mainly of women who came to be known as the Blue Ladies, usually the wives of in fluential men in military, economic, and political circles, and who the mselves became in fluential and wealthy. She acquired a reputation for world- class shopping, for which the term “Imeldific” was coined. Tiffany, Saks Fifth Avenue, and other tony establishments not just in New York City but in other capitals like Paris and Rome loved her, for she thought nothing of dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on one visit. Her extravagant taste in cluded choice real estate as well, and in the 1980 s she snapped up choice Manhattan properties, in cluding the prestigious Crown Building in midtown ($51 million) and the Herald Shopping Center ($60 million), catty corner from Macy’s department store. Her choice of residence while visiting Manhattan was a suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Like Ferdinand, Imelda was consumed by the pathological desire to remake herself, which meant reinventing her past to conform to a grander self-image. No telling or more extravagant monument testifies to this obsession than the Santo Niño (Holy Infant) shrine in the city in which she grew up, Tacloban—the very same capital where, in 1944, General Douglas Mac Arthur first announced to Filipinos that he had, as promised, returned. Built at a reputed $23 million in 1980, the huge two-story affair—part antebellum Southern mansion and part Spanish grandee’s home with Moorish arches—sits on a lot once occupied by a rather more modest dwelling that was young Imelda’s residence. The statue of the Holy Infant Jesus is ensconced in a ground floor chapel, flanked in congruously by guest bedrooms, each with a different motif. On the grand stairway leading to the second floor is a huge portrait of a gossamer-like Imelda, rising from the misty waters, an unmistakable reference to Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Upstairs are cavernous master bedrooms, with a reception hall complete with two thrones at one end. On the occasion of Pope John Paul’s 1981 six-day visit to the Philippines, the only predominantly Roman Catholic nation in Asia, Imelda or dered that fences be erected and whitewashed, to hide the in numerable festering slums of Manila the Pope would otherwise see. She had also planned the construction of an extravagant basilica, at a cost of a reported $100 million, with a 48-foot statue of the Holy Infant. Drawing heavy criticism even from the conservative Catholic hierarchy, the plan was abandoned. The First Lady had wanted the pontiff to stay at the Coconut Palace, a massive residence situated on the grounds of the Cultural Center, which had gold-plated bathroom fixtures and was built largely with materials derived from the coconut tree. John Paul turned down the in vitation, opting to stay at the Papal Nuncio’s of ficial residence. With Imelda leading the charge and despite other pressing and chronic needs, such as low-cost housing, the government built luxury hotels in an effort to promote to urism; added to the Cultural Center complex a gigantic 10,000-seat Folk Arts Theater to stage the 1974 Miss Universe beauty pageant; and constructed the Heart Center, in a country where malnutrition, rather than heart disease, is the most pressing health concern"

But it was in the hasty construction of the Film Palace—again, on the Cultural Center grounds—and the resulting deaths, which scandalized the public already in ured to the First Lady’s mania for oversized, unnecessary projects. The Film Palace was to be the primary venue for what Imelda had hoped would be in 1982 an in ternationally known film festival, one that would compete with Cannes and Tokyo. To make it in time for the festival opening, construction proceeded twenty-four hours seven days a week. As a result, a top floor collapsed when its cement foundation gave way, having not fully dried. Though the government has never said how many workers died, many accounts put the number at 169. The government tried to hush up the accident, but the tragedy was simply too large to escape unnoticed. It cast a pall over the festival proceedings, as rumors spread that the building was being haunted by the restless spirits of the dead workers. Exorcism rites were thus performed, to placate them. T HE C OSTS OF THE N EW S OCIETY Human Rights The Marcos regime stifled opposition, whether violent or not. From student activists to community or ganizers, from human rights advocates to academics, the sweep at the outset of martial law was broad and in discriminate, with approximately 30,000 people arrested. Most were citizens who had peacefully expressed their democratic right of dissent. The regime also cracked down on radio and television stations and shut down the in dependent press. One of its first moves was to confiscate the giant media conglomerate ABS-CBN, owned by the López family, a pillar of the old oligarchy. Fernando López had been Ferdinand’s vice president during his first term but had since fallen out of favor. The Lópezes’ media empire was too irresistible a target for the Marcoses and the new oligarchs. The suspension of civil liberties and the broad powers granted the military and the Philippine Constabulary led to systematic abuse, especially on the part of the constabulary, reprising its role as the main enforcer of American colonial rule. Amnesty International issued a report that stated four years after the declaration of martial law, the regime held at least 6,000 political prisoners, with to rture a routine method of in terrogating political dissidents. Female detainees were of ten sexually molested or raped. The most famous political prisoner was, of course, Senator Aquino, kept in solitary confinement. In Latin America the term desaparecidos, or “disappeared,” came to refer to unexplained, sudden disappearances and subsequent deaths at the hands of the authorities. In the Philippines, the equivalent term for extrajudicial killings was “salvaging,” paradoxically referring to a meaning opposite that of being saved or rescued. In the grisly parlance of the Marcos years, a person who was “salvaged” was someone summarily executed, with out any judicial proceedings whatsoever, the security and military for ces acting as judge, jury, and executioner. The body would be dumped usually where it was sure to be found, sending an unmistakable signal of how the regime treated dissidents. From 1973 to 1985, a human rights group, Task Force Detainees Philippines (TFDP), documented a to tal of 2,255 cases of such killings, with 334 disappearances between 1977 and 1983, where no corpse was ever found. One of the most notorious cases of salvaging was that of Macliing Dulag, a Kalinga tribal chief from the mountainous Cordillera region in northern Luzon. Dulag led a vigorous opposition to a proposed World Bank-funded Chico river dam that would have flooded ancient and sacred ancestral lands. Dulag was gunned down at this house on April 24, 1980—a date now commemorated as Cordillera Day. His death was not in vain, as the project was cancelled. In the countryside, the government created armed militias known as the Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs), which worked closely with the constabulary and army units. The CHDFs turned in creasingly violent, as well as corrupt. Adding to this volatile mix were fanatically anti-communist paramilitary cults, backed by the local military commands. These terrorized rural hamlets where in surgents, or their sympathizers, were thought to be hiding. To be seen as a collaborator with the NPA was in their eyes tantamount to a death sentence. Ironically, such cults had their roots in in digenous resistance to Spanish rule in the previous century, reacting both to state oppression and religious tyranny. In their twentieth-century in carnation, they now acted as unofficial agents of the state. With names like Pulajanes and Tad-Tad—a name that translates chillingly as “chop-chop” and suggests this particular group’s favored modus operandi— the cults appealed to disenfranchised and unemployed men in rural areas, men with little or no future. With the change to the more human rights-or iented Carter administration, pro-democracy activists believed a window of opportunity had opened. It had, but, disappointingly, only by a crack. Nothing of substance changed. When Carter’s vice president, Walter Mondale, paid a visit to Manila, he was expected to reiterate unambiguously Washington’s emphasis on human rights. He met with Marcos and separately with the opposition as well as with the hugely in fluential Manila archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin.

While pro-democracy activists were hopeful these meetings would be publicized, they were in fact low-key sessions, and no press photographers were allowed, for fear of of fending Marcos. The conference with Cardinal Sin was particularly disappointing since Sin and the other top Catholic prelates were untouchable, but Sin would not take the occasion to oppose one-man rule. He characterized his stance as one of critical collaboration with the Marcos regime. Observers felt, however, that the good cardinal was in fact more of a collaborator than a critic. As the Far Eastern Economic Review put it, “With rare exceptions, Sin has pretty much toed the line of the regime.” “Some Are Smarter Than Others” The first years of martial law saw a surge in economic growth, with an average annual rate of 7 percent, due mainly to an in crease in government revenue, in ternational lending, and to urism. New public schools were built, and massive in frastructure projects were undertaken that did improve highways and bridges. In particular, the Pan-Philippine Highway and the San Juanico Bridge—the longest bridge in the archipelago and spanning the straits between the islands of Samar and Leyte, Imelda’s home province—were held up as examples of the New Society constructively engaged in modernizing the country. Nevertheless, while immense wealth was being created, very little of it trickled down to the masses. By the end of the 1970 s, economic in dicators belied the rosy picture projected by government technocrats. Average monthly wages declined by 20 percent, with a 30 percent decline in agriculture and 40 percent in commerce. Prices for basic commodities such as cooking oil, rice, sugar and salt tripled. In 1971, the in come of the lowest 40 percent of families was barely 12 percent of the to tal; in 1981, this declined to 9 percent. In contrast, the top 10 percent earned close to 40 percent of the to tal in 1971; this rose to 42 percent in 1981. Dictatorial rule did nothing to narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots; on the contrary, martial law only made it worse. The percentage of people living below the poverty line in creased to 50 percent of the population by the time the Marcoses fled the country. Hence, the proliferation of slums in Metro Manila and other major urban areas, as the jobless and the homeless flocked to the big cities seeking work. It wasn’t only members of the low-end of the wage spectrum that moved abroad, seeking greener pastures. Professionals, such as doctors, nurses, and engineers, did too. There was a demand for contract labor in the Middle East due to petro-dollar-financed construction projects, while in the United States, medical personnel from abroad were recruited avidly, the domestic ranks of doctors and nurses being depleted by the demands of the Vietnam War. Thus began what is more commonly known as the “brain drain.” Increasingly, as a kind of mirror image of Japanese men going on sex to urs of the Philippines—a trade that was implicitly encouraged by the Department of Tourism—young women sought work as dancers and entertainers in the dimly lit yakuza- controlled bars and clubs of such cities as Tokyo and Osaka. (Both types of exodus continue to this day.) One major cause for the continuing slide into poverty for a majority of Filipinos was crony capitalism, where government projects became a cash cow not only for the Marcoses but also for their friends and relatives. While the regime had to a large degree broken up the old oligarchy and disbanded their private militias, it simply replaced the for mer with one of its own making, with its members for ming their own private militias. It was in deed a New Society—a society of new oligarchs drawn from the Marcoses’ respective clans and circle of friends. In 1979, Ricardo Manapat, a philosophy professor at a leading Philippine university, wrote a pamphlet that examined crony capitalism under the Marcos regime. The title Manapat gave it, “Some Are Smarter Than Others,” was based on a remark Imelda made when asked about the sudden wealth of certain relatives: “Sometimes, you have smart relatives who can make it…. My dear, there are always people who are just a little faster, more brilliant, more aggressive.” One of the most egregious examples of crony capitalism was the deal to build a nuclear power plant on the Bataan Peninsula, northwest of Manila. The construction of the plant, began in 1976, was envisioned partly in response to the oil crisis of the decade. But it was hardly a project a poor country could afford; nevertheless the regime went ahead with its plans. The site of the power plant raised alarming prospects of a nuclear meltdown, being situated near three earthquake fault lines and a then dormant volcano Mt. Pinatubo that would in fact erupt fiercely in 1991. The facility was also at risk from possible tsunamis from the nearby South China Sea. General Electric would have won the contract to build two reactors, with its bid of $700 million. However, Westinghouse managed to convince Herminio Disini—kin to Imelda by marriage, friend and golfing partner of Ferdinand—to in tercede on its behalf. Disini was persuasive and the contract was awarded to Westinghouse in stead. By then, the cost had escalated to $1.2 billion, the most expensive nuclear plant project in the world at that time. Though completed, it never got to operate and was shut down in the immediate aftermath of the Marcoses’ for ced departure in 1986. The Filipino taxpayer was, as usual, left holding the bag. Crony capitalism also reared its head in agribusiness, with the two most profitable cash crops—sugar and coconuts—coming to be monopolized by Marcos confidants and business associates"

Crony capitalism also reared its head in agribusiness, with the two most profitable cash crops—sugar and coconuts—coming to be monopolized by Marcos confidants and business associates. The enormous profits generated by consolidated control bankrolled the regional domination—political, judicial, social, and military—by these new oligarchs. In sugar, Roberto Benedicto, a fraternity brother of Marcos when both were law students at the University of the Philippines, called the shots, while in the coconut in dustry, it was Defense Secretary Enrile and businessman Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco (first cousin to Senator Aquino’s wife, Corazon Cojuangco). Through a tax on coconut production known as the coconut levy, the enormous amounts of money generated were then deposited in a bank specifically set up for this purpose, the United Coconut Planters Bank, or UCPB. Theoretically the bank and its assets were meant to serve the vast majority of coconut farmers who had small landholdings. Instead, the UCPB at the behest of its crony-dominated board set about acquiring a near-monopoly on coconut mills, the reby controlling prices for the processing of the nuts, which it set at below-market rates, and thus generating huge profits. Cojuangco used his position as Marcos crony and president of the bank—which had by the start of the 1980 s over $1 billion in levies—to not only amass personal wealth in the hundreds of millions of dollars but also buy controlling shares in the country’s largest food-and-beverage corporation, San Miguel, makers of the world-famous San Miguel beer. For those who benefited from crony capitalism, the days under the Marcoses were happy ones. They had tons of cash, all the luxuries they wanted, and power, as well as access to the ultimate dispenser of power: Marcos. He was the godfather, and his cronies (as well as Imelda’s) were the capos, who made sure that the godfather (and the godmother) received their share. They could operate with special dispensation from the government and were relatively immune from competition. Nevertheless, except in a few cases, crony businesses were in efficient in the long run, for cing the administration to bail out these compadre- run companies, in creasing deficit spending and, of course, for eign debt. The losses that resulted from corporations that closed were borne not by the cronies but by the laid-off workers, who had no assets stowed away in various banks, and ultimately by the average taxpayer. Rice Production and Land Reform Land has always been central to the lives of the rural folk, who for most of the country’s history have constituted the majority of the populace. Previous at tempts to reform the system so there would be land for the landless tiller failed, despite the high-flown rhetoric and the dramatic photo opportunities occasioned by public of ficials presenting land titles to a few lucky recipients. Marcos promised to be different. Shortly after the proclamation of martial law, he declared in no uncertain terms, “If land reform fails, there is no New Society.” His program did fail. There was no real New Society. Rather than challenging the prevailing class system through the New Society or eliminating the entrenched oligarchy, Marcos simply changed the main cast of characters but not the play. His land reform program was bound to fail because no sustained at tempt was made to implement it. More to the point, it left two-thirds of the country’s agricultural lands untouched—huge estates dedicated to cash crops, such as sugar, coconuts, and pineapple. A mere 1,500 tenants—0.5 percent of the supposed beneficiaries—had, by 1979, gotten titles to 0.3 percent of the land reform area. Moreover, coverage did not in clude such sectors as landless rural workers and tenant farmers working crops other than rice or corn. Other loopholes existed that provided the savvy landowner with ways of evading land reform legally. Small landowners and tenants were reluctant to participate. The for mer feared that they would not be fairly compensated. The latter knew that even if they were given land, they still had to shoulder new financial burdens, for farm to ols, fertilizer, seeds, etc. Government credit that was supposedly available was more of ten than not in sufficient. And of course borrowing from loan sharks simply in creased the chances of defaulting on their debts. In the end, the rural poor gained nothing from the supposed reform. One facet of the Marcos regime’s agricultural program was its emphasis on the in creased production of rice through the so-called Green Revolution. Through work at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in nearby Los Baños—established in 1960 and funded by the Rockefeller and Ford foundations —hybrid, high-yield varieties of rice were cultivated. The idea was that in creased production would lead to larger market sales and thus help alleviate poverty in the countryside. Marcos heralded the Green Revolution as a way of developing export agriculture and the reby in creasing for eign exchange reserves. In the early stages of martial law, due to in creased borrowing on the part of the government, exports from the agricultural sector in creased (as did the national debt). But the rather enormous fly in the ointment was that these high- yield strains of so-called miracle rice required large doses of chemical pesticides and oil-based fertilizers. These were not only expensive but harmful to the soil, adversely affecting the fragile ecology of soil nutrients and crop diversity. These strains only benefited already wealthy landowners and agribusinesses, and they for ced the small farmer to in cur loans that of ten, due to bad harvests, they would be unable to repay. As a consequence, many lost their lands they had or iginally mortgaged to secure loans"

By 1985, the country needed to import 538,000 tons of rice. Rather than help resolve the land reform dilemma, the Green Revolution seemed to have exacerbated it. Additionally, the in come derived from export agriculture, while seemingly boosting GNP, was mostly kept by those of the elite who were close to the Marcos administration. Traditional moneymakers like sugar and coconut were controlled by powerful cronies such as Eduardo Cojuangco and Juan Ponce Enrile in coconut, and Roberto Benedicto in sugar, so that very little of those profits were ever seen by the small farmers. Other cash crops such as bananas and pineapple and for estry products proved to be hugely profitable as well, with the latter leading to an in crease in deforestation. With the overriding emphasis on monoculture, huge plantations reduced the availability of land for other crops. Sadly, workers laboring over fruit rarely if ever tasted the fruit of their labors. T HE I NSURGENCIES G ROW The New People’s Army Rather than discouraging the rebellious to lay down their arms, martial law bolstered the numbers of those taking to the hills to join the New People’s Army. The NPA had succeeded the Hukbalahap, having been co-founded by the disaffected young Huk fighter Bernabe Buscayno and by José Maria Sison, the most prominent dissident member of the PKP, the Huks’ parent or ganization. Both the Huks and the NPA emerged from the same region, Central Luzon, and both focused in itially on land issues: from tenancy and sharecropping to profit- sharing and the aimed-for breakup of the huge estates for their redistribution to peasants. The larger context—of having a more active say in how they were to be governed, principally—linked the NPA to prior movements fueled by agrarian unrest, such as the Sakdalistas, and most significantly, to the older revolutionary tradition of the Bonifacio-led Kataastasan Kagalagalangan Katipunan, or KKK. This time, however, a well-defined ideology—Mao’s in terpretation of Marxist- Leninist thought—shaped the direction and in ternal policies of the CPP and, of course, the NPA. Marcos proved to be the NPA’s most effective recruiter, albeit unwittingly. The crackdown on civil liberties and media; the roundup of student activists, or ganizers, and left-leaning urban professionals; the use of to rture; and the senseless salvagings for ced a generation of young men and women to go underground, whether this was within the cities or to the hills. The in fusion of a radicalized, educated, sophisticated middle-class segment, with networks all over the country, into the ranks of the CPP-NPA in vigorated the in surgency, hastening its emergence as a nationwide movement. In 1973, the National Democratic Front (NDF) sprang into being, as a number of left-leaning groups, such as the Christians for National Liberation (CNL) and the Cordillera People’s Democratic Front, saw the need for a coalition that would bring to gether similarly minded or ganizations and provide a channel through which progressive ideas about change could be disseminated. Due to its size and strength, the CPP/NPA dominated the NDF, rendering the latter in the view of the establishment a surrogate for the Communists. Even with Buscayno’s capture in 1976, and Sison’s in 1977, the NPA continued to expand. By the mid 1980 s, on the eve of the Marcos regime’s collapse, the NPA had guerrilla fronts in 63 of 72 provinces, and by 1986, when the conjugal dictators fled, its armed strength was estimated by the Philippine military at 26,000 regular guerrillas, a larger force of part-time irregulars, and a mass base of 2 million. Far more than the Huks, the NPA constituted a serious threat to the stability of the government. The Huks had been concentrated in Central Luzon and focused primarily on land redistribution. In contrast, the NPA operated nationally and sought to address a broader array of issues, from economic in equality and government corruption to the snail’s pace of justice. Able to fight on many fronts, the NPA had the capacity at times to field company-strength units of 200 to 300 men and women (unlike the MNLF, the NPA in cluded women fighters, and wholeheartedly believed in Mao’s dictum that women hold up half of heaven). According to a 1985 report issued by the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the “NPA in conjunction with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) controls or is contesting control of settlements in habited by at least 10 million people. The military in itiative clearly rests with the NPA.” The report went on to state, “NPA units nationwide now routinely at tack Government for ces…. Many NPA at tacks on military outposts are in tended to acquire weapons. By the end of 1983 the NPA claimed to have obtained 20,000 weapons, in cluding machine guns and grenade launchers.” Often, the CPP/NPA was the only government in the countryside in what were called “liberated zones.” The NPA had units that worked with local communities to build schools, and help peasant farmers. It also dispensed justice rather swiftly, if not always impartially—in contrast to the many local grievances that languished in the courts. Ideology may have shaped the thinking of top CPP and NPA leaders, but it was rarely, if ever, a factor in what motivated the rank and file"

The bitter experiences of having suffered in justices too long at the hands of an in different, even callous, landlord-dominated system—the rape of a daughter, say, or the murder of a father—and the desire to see their children lead much better lives prompted them to take up arms or serve the guerrillas in some other way. Until the government in Manila dealt seriously with the underlying causes, there would always be willing recruits for the underground struggle. The Moro National Liberation Front If the in tent of martial law was to tamp down the fires of rebellion, it failed miserably not just with the leftist in surgency of the New People’s Army but with the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF. Founded in 1972 by Moro activists prior to the declaration of martial law from a relatively quiescent or ganization known as the Bangsa Moro Movement, the MNLF aimed to create a separate state (the Bangsa Moro) consisting of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and the island of Palawan. The MNLF was headed by University of the Philippines professor Nur Misuari, a member of the Taosug tribe of Jolo. The struggle for in dependence and now secession had of course deep historical roots, going all the way back to the struggle with the Spanish colonizers. During the American colonial era the Muslim elite were wary of being part of an in dependent, Christian Philippines, and they expressed the desire to be some sort of U. S. protectorate. This sentiment was ignored, and in 1946 an in dependent Philippine Republic emerged that was constituted of Luzon, the Visayas, and all of Mindanao. One catalyst for the rapid rise in armed militancy among Filipino Muslims was the Jabidah Massacre of 1968. Young, able-bodied Moros in southern Mindanao had been recruited by the military and brought to Corregidor Island for training. There the recruits found out the real reason for their recruitment: as part of a secret elite unit, they were meant to foment disturbances among ethnic Tausug and Sama in the island of Sabah. Once British control of the island ended in 1963, it had become part of Malaysia. The Macapagal administration protested, saying that Sabah had been historically and was still part of the Sultanate of Sulu, and thus a part of the Republic of the Philippines. Marcos continued the suit but secretly planned the small-scale guerrilla war to strengthen his case. The Moro recruits, not desiring to fight fellow Muslims who furthermore hailed from the same ethnic groups, expressed their in tent to quit and return to southern Mindanao. Instead, on March 18, they were taken to a remote location on the island in small groups and machine-gunned. (The number of Moros massacred ranged from the government’s low estimate of twenty-eight, to the Moro National Liberation Front’s 200.) A survivor managed to escape to the mainland and tell his story, which outraged the Muslim communities and provoked a diplomatic firestorm with Malaysia that recalled its ambassador. The Jabidah massacre further radicalized Moro activists, one of whom was Nur Misuari. Compared to their Christian compatriots, Moros were poorer, less educated, with their areas suffering from in adequate in frastructure. Concentrated in Basilan, Zamboanga, the Sulu archipelago, and southern Mindanao, along with animist tribes, Moros—only 5 percent of the population then—generally were treated as second-class citizens and routinely discriminated against. Their few political representatives acted as traditional warlords and of ten were allied with powerful Christian politicians. To top it all, the wholesale migration of Visayan and Luzon homesteaders to Mindanao—billed as “The Land of Promise”—had been encouraged early on by the United States and in the 1950 s by Ramón Magsaysay. Christian settlers moving in and claiming Muslim communal and ancestral lands ironically replicated the process of land seizure their own for ebears had suffered at the hands of the Spanish and the principalia. Predictably, such resettlement engendered land and power disputes that in evitably led to violence. The Muslims had legitimate long-standing grievances, as the government, whether the legislature, the judiciary, or the military, was controlled by Christians. And Christians had started to form the majority population in many traditional Muslim areas—a clear threat to the Muslim political establishment. Animosity between the two groups led to both Muslim and Christian politicians for ming private armies. Those of the Christians were known as the Ilagas (a Visayan word meaning “rats”) while their Moro counterparts were called the Black Shirts, and, in one case, the Barracudas. Fighting between the two groups reached its height in the 1970 s, when the MNLF and the Philippine state were at war. The declaration of martial law in 1972 not only in tensified their struggle for power but was the spark that ignited the deadly conflict all across southern Mindanao, one that conflated a religious war with a civil one, albeit not on a national scale. Not only did the decree further consolidate power in Manila, a bastion of Catholicism, it delegitimized any anti-establishment activity. Above all, the Marcos regime’s at tempt to confiscate firearms from the private sector was further in terpreted as a move to leave the Muslims defenseless against the use of Christian-directed military force. The MNLF was led by educated young men like Misuari who had studied either at Philippine universities or in the Middle East. They viewed the mselves through the prism of their faith rather than as Maranao, Maguindanao, or Tausug"

Fighting between the two groups reached its height in the 1970 s, when the MNLF and the Philippine state were at war. The declaration of martial law in 1972 not only in tensified their struggle for power but was the spark that ignited the deadly conflict all across southern Mindanao, one that conflated a religious war with a civil one, albeit not on a national scale. Not only did the decree further consolidate power in Manila, a bastion of Catholicism, it delegitimized any anti-establishment activity. Above all, the Marcos regime’s at tempt to confiscate firearms from the private sector was further in terpreted as a move to leave the Muslims defenseless against the use of Christian-directed military force. The MNLF was led by educated young men like Misuari who had studied either at Philippine universities or in the Middle East. They viewed the mselves through the prism of their faith rather than as Maranao, Maguindanao, or Tausug. Committed to changing the traditional patterns of wealth and power, they dissociated the mselves from the old-guard Moro politicians, most of whom they regarded as allied with Marcos. The MNLF leadership established contacts with Malaysian leaders and with Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi. Once martial law was declared and the at tempt made to seize firearms from Muslims, the armed phase of what had been a peaceful movement began. Malaysia, wanting to pay back Marcos for his botched 1968 at tempt, provided training for a select group of MNLF commanders on Sabah itself, the territory contested by both the Philippines and Malaysia. And, along with Libya, Malaysia provided arms and supplies, with Libya doing so through Malaysia. From late 1972 to the first half of 1975, the MNLF held its own against the AFP and even scored victories in conventional battlefield encounters. In the meantime, Misuari had gone into exile in the Middle East, where he continued to lobby oil- and cash-rich Arab states for material support. Both the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) were sympathetic to the MNLF’s cause, which received widespread in ternational coverage, fueling nationalist pride among Mindanao’s Moros. According to government estimates, at its peak, the MNLF had from 50,000 to 60,000 fighters, though more realistic estimates placed the figure at closer to 30,000. The in surgency in Mindanao cost the public treasury immensely while tying down more than half of the military’s combat units. By late 1975, the MNLF began to experience setbacks in the field. Battle fatigue had set in, and there were significant numbers of rebel surrenderees. Sabah’s titular politician and a strong supporter of the MNLF, Tun Mustapha, fell from power. By then, Marcos’s tactics of cooptation—of fering money and positions to local Muslim leaders—had had some success. Many Muslim politicians began to portray the mselves as moderates—nationalist and pragmatic at the same time. Too, Imelda used her diplomatic charms on key Arab leaders, especially Qaddafi, who had threatened the Philippines with an oil embargo. In negotiations in Tripoli with four member states of the OIC—Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Senegal, and Libya—in late December of 1976, the Marcos regime negotiated a ceasefire with the MNLF. The ceasefire provided both sides room to breathe and regroup, while negotiations were undertaken to work out the details of what would later be known as the Tripoli Agreement. The Tripoli Agreement represented a compromise between the Philippine republic and the MNLF. The latter now sought autonomy rather than in dependence while the Marcos government had to cede power to a region that it had long sought to dominate. Instead of the or iginal twenty-one provinces the MNLF had wanted to in clude, it had to settle for thirteen, eight of which had Christian majorities. The agreement stipulated that within the autonomous areas Muslims had the right to form their own schools, establish courts based on shariah or Islamic law, and create administrative systems, in cluding a legislative assembly, executive council, and its own security for ces. However, at an unspecified date, the MNLF men-under-arms would be in tegrated with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. While it seemed to hard-liners within the Marcos administration that he had given too many concessions to the Moro rebels, in fact, Marcos reduced pressure from the OIC and effectively took Libya, the MNLF’s strongest supporter, out of the equation. Most significantly a key provision in the agreement left its implementation to the Marcos regime. Despite objections from Misuari and the MNLF, Marcos determined that a plebiscite was needed to approve the creation of an autonomous region. The results? Ten of the thirteen provinces opted for autonomy. The Marcos regime then divided the ten provinces into two regions, making it easier to rule these areas even if grouped as one autonomous entity. In the meantime, Misuari’s leadership was challenged by his deputy Hashim Salamat, who resigned and for med a breakaway group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF. Educated at Cairo University and connected with Muslim reformers in the Philippines, Salamat was a more or thodox Muslim than the secular-minded Misuari and other MNLF leaders. Complicating the situation further was the emergence of the obscure Bangsa Moro Liberation Organization (BMLO), which claimed to represent traditional Moro society. Its leaders were old-school politicians, one of whom, Macapanton Abbas, had once served with the Marcos regime as government liaison to Moro districts. There were credible reports that in fact the regime was secretly funding the BMLO. The existence of three rival groups of course worked to the regime’s advantage, as it now began to negotiate with the MILF, pointedly ignoring the MNLF.

T HE A SSASSINATION OF N INOY A QUINO: E NDGAME In March of 1980, Senator Aquino had suffered a heart at tack and in May was allowed to depart for the United States with his family. After a successful heart operation and three years of quiet exile with his family in Boston, which in cluded teaching at Harvard University, in 1983, he decided to fly back to Manila to try and engage the dictator in a constructive dialogue in which he hoped Marcos would agree to a peaceful transfer of power. By now the strongman’s deteriorating health was an open secret: he was suffering from lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder that affected his kidneys, requiring regular dialysis. It meant there were times when he was not in charge. Aquino feared a bloody struggle of succession would tear the country apart when Marcos died. Despite warnings from friends and from in siders within the Marcos regime, and a rendezvous with Imelda in New York City where she tried to persuade him to stay put, he flew via a circuitous route and under an assumed name, Marcial Bonifacio (a play on martial law, and the name of the military camp he had been detained in), to Manila and arrived on August 21, 1983. His at tempt at anonymity failed, nor did the bulletproof vest he wore protect him from a shot to the back of the head, killing him in stantly as he was being escorted off the plane by a government security detail, part of the Aviation Security Command. Ironically, had Aquino been allowed to deliver a speech upon disembarking, part of what he would have read stated that “the willing sacrifice of the in nocent is the most powerful answer to in solent tyranny that has yet been conceived by God or man.” Earlier, before he flew to Manila, he had said prophetically, “The Filipino is worth dying for.” A lone gunman and small-time gangster by the name of Rolando Galman, with no history of radical association with either the Left or the Right, was blamed by the government for Aquino’s assassination; conveniently, Galman was himself shot dead right after Aquino fell lifeless on the airport tarmac. No one believed this trumped-up story. Facts unearthed after the assassination revealed that the hapless Galman had been abducted by government security for ces to play the role, literally, of fall guy. Thousands of mourners lined up to see Ninoy’s “salvaged” body, displayed in an open casket, the bloodied face left untouched by the funeral parlor, upon in structions from his bereaved family who wanted to show the world the regime’s calculated brutality. At least two million people lined the streets to watch the funeral cortege—an impressive and historic display of public grief, as well as an eloquent protest against the Marcoses, though the government-controlled media paid scant at tention. Ninoy’s martyrdom energized Philippine society and heralded the beginning of the regime’s end. While opposition from the poor and the left had always been a constant, what was new was the now active participation of the middle and upper classes in opposing the Marcoses. There was among them the growing feeling that if a member of the privileged class could be gunned down in broad daylight, no one was safe. Instead of passively holding, the center—whether in business, politics, or religion—moved actively into the ranks of the opposition. Massive street demonstrations became a regular feature of the urban landscape in Metro Manila. Revealing the depth of disenchantment with the Marcoses, the staid and normally apolitical businessmen and -women and white-collar workers of Makati—the country’s Wall Street—enthusiastically showered the marchers on the broad boulevards below with confetti and shouted anti-government slogans. The in sistent question was, “Who killed Ninoy?” It didn’t require a stretch of the imagination to see the hand of the military, if not the Marcoses, behind the foul deed. Under in tense domestic and in ternational pressure for an impartial in vestigation, Marcos dismissed the first in quiry commission, headed by a known Marcos partisan, and appointed one headed by Judge Corazon Agrava, respected for her in dependence. The Agrava Commission quickly threw out the lone-gunman the ory and, in late 1984, concluded what the public in stinctively believed, that the military escort had shot Aquino, and then shot and killed Galman. The Agrava Commission also determined that high-ranking military of ficers led by General Fabian Ver, Marcos’s relative and chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, had planned Aquino’s murder. Ver was famous for his unswerving loyalty to the dictator. The standard joke in Manila about the devoted Ver was that if Marcos asked him to jump from a building, Ver’s only question would be, “Sir, from which floor?” Marcos reluctantly suspended Ver prior to the for thcoming trial. In its Epilogue, the Agrava Commission in dicted the regime as well when it stated: … the killing of the late for mer Senator Aquino has brought into sharper focus the ills pervading Philippine society. It was this concretization of the horror that has been haunting this country for decades, routinely manifested by the breakdown of peace and or der, economic in stability, graft and corruption, and an in creasing number of abusive elements in what are otherwise noble in stitutions in our country—the military and law enforcement agencies. But after a sham trial before a special court, General Ver and twenty-four other high-ranking of ficials, and one civilian, were acquitted. Ver was quickly reinstated as chief of staff. Military support was absolutely essential if the Marcos regime were to weather the storm. In the end, only low-ranking soldiers received prison sentences. The predictable outcome of course further in flamed the public and triggered even more demonstrations. With the credibility of Marcos’s rule in shambles, and capital flight in tensifying due to the threat of a precipitous descent into chaos, the economy was in a tailspin. It was the deepest crisis in the history of the dictatorship, one that would bring it to its knees ultimately. The crisis had other effects"

With the credibility of Marcos’s rule in shambles, and capital flight in tensifying due to the threat of a precipitous descent into chaos, the economy was in a tailspin. It was the deepest crisis in the history of the dictatorship, one that would bring it to its knees ultimately. The crisis had other effects. For one thing, it spurred the rise of reformist elements in the military, notably the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM, a group of colonels, graduates of the Philippine Military Academy, that wished to rid the AFP of corruption, reinstill a sense of professionalism in the ranks, enforce a merit system of promotion—Marcos was notorious for his nepotism—and work for peaceful and legal change. Marcos’s in transigence further enlarged the ranks of the NPA and deepened U. S. domestic opposition to the Reagan government’s support of the dictatorship. U. S. policies to wards the regime began to change. What had been uncritical support now came under in tense scrutiny. Congressman Stephen Solarz, in fluential chair of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who had at tended Ninoy Aquino’s funeral, urged the Reagan administration to distance itself from the Marcoses. Adding his voice to the growing chorus of dissatisfaction was Senator Richard Lugar, head of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Filipino anti-Marcos groups in the U. S., from all across the ideological spectrum, grew more stringent in their criticism both of the Marcos dictatorship and the Reagan government. In public, the White House held on tight to the regime, but at the same time the State Department and the Pentagon made it clear that reforms were needed in the AFP, and that the U. S. needed to approach the legal opposition to canvass for a suitable replacement for the ailing dictator, a liberal who would also protect U. S. in terests. Marcos resisted the pressure to reform the military, as the leaders he had in stalled for med his main and, in creasingly, sole support. Nevertheless, in a bold and desperate ploy, on November 3, 1985, Marcos announced on the U. S. network television program, “This Week with David Brinkley,” that he would hold early presidential elections in January of 1986. It was an experienced lawyer’s calculated gamble, to cloak the retention of power in legality, somewhat mollifying U. S. critics but holding the very real threat of an upset win by the opposition. Because of the short notice, Filipinos referred to this as the “snap” election, later postponed to February. T HE S NAP E LECTIONS Corazon Cojuangco Aquino would be David against Goliath. A month after the strongman’s announcement on U. S. television, and presented with 1.2 million signatures, the widow of the slain senator agreed reluctantly to run against the aging dictator and the ruling Kilusan Bagong Lipunan (KBL). Salvador Laurel, heretofore also a presidential candidate, was persuaded to be her running mate, thus presenting a unified opposition field under the banner of the political party for med by Ninoy Aquino in 1978, the Lakas ng Bayan, its acronym being Laban, a Tagalog word which means “Fight.” (Ninoy had while in detention for med the party to oppose Marcos’s KBL in the 1978 National Assembly’s regional elections. All its 21 candidates lost in elections completely dominated by the ruling party.) During the campaign, Marcos confidently projected a landslide victory for himself and his running mate, Arturo Tolentine, questioning how a convent- educated housewife (an image both campaigns utilized for diametrically opposed reasons) could possibly cope with the numerous and complicated economic and security problems facing the nation. He contrasted his skills with Aquino’s lack of political experience, to which Aquino riposted that in deed, she lacked experience, especially in stealing and cheating. Hoping to placate the voters, Marcos dangled several carrots before them, such as reduced housing and utility costs, an in crease in government salaries, more schools, and tax breaks. A comic element was in troduced when Imelda belittled the widow’s lack of fashion sense and her preference for simple yellow dresses. (Yellow had become the opposition color, due to the yellow ribbons Filipinos displayed when her husband Ninoy was assassinated.) Part of the underlying tension between the two women, apart from the suspicion that Imelda had a hand in the plot to kill her husband, was due to class. Educated in exclusive schools at home and abroad, Cory Cojuangco Aquino was born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth, being a member of the immensely wealthy Cojuangco clan that owned Hacienda Luisita. Imelda Romualdez, on the other hand, had grown up in genteel poverty in the sticks and had clawed her way to the top while at tempting to erase the facts of her childhood. The fact that the snap elections pitted an aging tyrant and wily master politician against a saintly political ingénue who happened to be the widow of Ninoy Aquino, a martyr for his country, presented a spectacle fraught with symbols in a country with a fetish for symbols. The elections were a morality play, and a moro-moro, where good and evil were clearly delineated. It was a good old-fashioned cinematic melodrama, an eminently hissable villain with a harridan for a wife plotting against a betrayed mother—Cory doing triple-duty as the mother herself, the grieving widow, and stand-in for the mother country long suffering from abuse heaped on her by a wayward son and daughter. In Philippine iconography there are no more sacrosanct figures than a mother and a martyr’s widow: beneath the jock veneer laid down by the Spanish and the Americans, Filipino society is strongly matriarchal—one reason the most revered Catholic figures are representations of mother and child: the Virgin Mary and the Holy Infant Jesus"

During the campaign, the Marcoses vilified her gender, unwittingly galvanizing the women voters and betraying an ignorance of the Filipino psyche they claimed to know so well. In or der to protect their aggrieved mother, the people had no choice but to rise up against a brutal regime. Part of the opposition strategy was to urge the public to boycott the goods and services of companies owned and operated by Marcos cronies. Still, the Marcoses and the KBL held all the aces, and no one expected the elections to be a walk in the park for Cory. But a major revelation that seriously undermined whatever credibility Marcos had left was the fact that the twenty- seven medals supposedly awarded to him for his World War II heroics were fake. He was reputedly the most-decorated combat veteran of that war, second only to Audie Murphy, who went on to become a Hollywood star. (Marcos was also rumored to have an anting-anting, or amulet, embedded in his back that rendered him and his guerrilla unit impervious to harm.) During his tenure as chair of the Philippine Senate Appropriations Committee, for in stance, Marcos received no fewer than ten medals in 1963. But research by war veteran Colonel Bonifacio Gillego and in vestigative pieces in The New York Times and The Washington Post, based on archival research done by the historian Alfred Mc Coy, debunked Marcos’s claims to a storied war-time career. The guerrilla unit that he supposedly led, Maharlika, was of little value. Predictably, Marcos labeled the revelations part of a “smear campaign.” He claimed that Maharlika had 8,300 members and had performed valiantly under his leadership. In reality most of the exploits were figments of his imagination, and the guerrilla unit had approximately one hundred members, with no major feats accomplished. As early as 1948, after a thorough in vestigation, the U. S. military dismissed Marcos’s claims that he and his outfit had helped hasten the end of the war and concluded that Marcos’s false war claims amounted to a criminal act. Additionally, the records showed that Marcos had been arrested during the war for financial fraud. He was held but a short while before being released, an in dication that the young politician-on-the-make was already well-connected. In anticipation of the fact that the Marcoses would pull out all the stops to cling to power, the National Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL, was revived. NAMFREL had its or igins in the early 1950 s, created with CIA funds for the campaign of Ramón Magsaysay. In limbo during the martial law years, it was resurrected in 1983 and headed by an anti-Marcos entrepreneur, José Concepción Jr. It would compete with the government’s Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and provide a quick count of the ballots, to preempt the shady practice of most Philippine elections, dagdag-bawas (“add and subtract”), wherein tabulation is rigged to favor one party (usually the one with the most resources) over the other. In fact, the administration did at tempt to manipulate the overall tallies at the main COMELEC tabulation center, prompting a walk- out by COMELEC operators to protest such blatant cheating. Most of NAMFREL’s funds for the 1986 election came from such U. S. sources as the Agency for International Development, the National Endowment for Democracy, as well as from the Japanese government and American businessmen living in the Philippines. NAMFREL also helped support the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, and Radio Veritas, the church-owned radio station that would play a key role in the February 1986 People Power uprising. The Left Is Left Behind The fast-moving developments caught the radical left unprepared. Before Marcos sprung the idea of a snap election on the nation, a coalition of various left-wing opposition groups had for med in early 1985, calling itself Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, the New Nationalist Alliance, or BAYAN, for short, an acronym that means “nation” in Tagalog. Taken to gether, its constituent or ganizations provided a base of two and half million people. While affirming the need to depose the Marcos regime, and after much in ternal debate, in January of 1986 BAYAN opted to boycott the elections, a decision it would later rue. It issued a statement that read in part: There is no sense believing, the refore, that the snap election shall lead to the ouster of Marcos from power. In truth, it shall only for tify the U. S.-backed Marcos dictatorship…. The snap election does not promise meaningful changes in Philippine society … unless the electoral campaign can be transformed into a militant forum for advancing the anti-dictatorship struggle, the snap election shall be entirely meaningless…. In view of the for egoing, the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan deems that the people are left with no other principled option but to boycott the snap election. Some of BAYAN’s leaders felt they were missing an unprecedented opportunity to move their agenda for ward, and took a leave of absence from the or ganization, campaigning for Aquino. Other left-wing groups not allied with BAYAN also supported the elections and Aquino, arguing that she had spoken out against the retention of the U. S. bases; had promised the release of political prisoners if elected as well as amnesty for all those charged with political of fenses by the regime; and would draft a new constitution to replace the Marcos-era one.

Aquino then proposed meeting with the ailing dictator to effect a smooth transition of power, a proposal speedily turned down. For his part, trying to project a more neutral tone, President Reagan encouraged Marcos to work with his opponents to transform the political system —as though dictatorial rule since 1972 could so easily be changed. The U. S. president seemed to be in denial, however, when at a press conference shortly after the Marcos camp had of ficially declared its man the winner, he expressed his concern “about the violence that was evident there and the possibility of fraud, although it could have been that all of that was occurring on both sides.” His loyalty to the Marcoses couldn’t have been clearer. At the same time it in furiated the Filipino voters. U. S. Congressman Stephen Solarz sarcastically noted that the Reagan response was “evidence that the White House has been transformed into an opium den … [T]hey’ve clearly lost to uch with reality.” To the Reagan administration Marcos was a known entity, America’s Boy, whom different U. S. administrations had supported for twenty years. It found it difficult to envision a transition that would actually in volve the mass participation of Filipinos taking to the streets to oust the dictatorship— democracy in its rawest form. And that is precisely what occurred between February 22 and February 25, when a military coup about to fall flat on its face succeeded when the aroused citizenry of Metro Manila rallied around the rebels and for ced the Marcoses to flee. Marcos’s security for ces had gotten wind of a coup being planned by the RAM leaders, who were close to Enrile and Fidel Ramos, head of the Philippine Constabulary (and a relative of Marcos to boot). The RAM group in turn learned of or ders being issued for their arrest on February 22, prompting them, with Enrile and Ramos, to move to two military camps, Aguinaldo and Crame, that same day, with their followers. Abandoning his largely in effective stance of so- called “critical collaboration” with the regime, two days before the elections, Cardinal Sin had declared that Catholics could practice civil disobedience if they believed the elections to be fraudulent. No one doubted that it was an endorsement of Aquino. And it was Sin who, through Radio Veritas, exhorted listeners to come out onto the streets surrounding the two camps where the anti- Marcos for ces had holed up, and which faced each other across the broad lanes of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, or EDSA, in Quezon City. People Power, as it came to be known, was nothing short of a fairy tale come true. Unfolding over a period of four days, from February 22 to 25, at least a million citizens from all walks of life for med a human shield around the camps, an unprecedented display of the unarmed and the unnamed facing down the armed and dangerous. Beggar, priest, nun, matron, businessman, student, market vendor stood in the path of pro-Marcos tanks and assault troops, of fering them flowers and food, and exorcising the helicopter gunships overhead with their rosaries, crucifixes, and cheers. It was awe-in spiring, a modern-day Cecil B. De Mille spectacle and a hippie dream come true: a bloodless revolution, a war of the roses sans thorns, and a miracle all rolled into one, which would in spire similar miracles in Berlin, Moscow, Tiananmen, and Prague. At one point, against her handlers’ advice, Cory Aquino proceeded to one of the camps and told the cheering throngs there that “for the first time in the history of the world, a civilian population has been called to defend the military.” That it would also herald, albeit unknowingly, the restoration of the ancien régime was at the moment scarcely evident. The urban populace, and the country—for similar outpourings occurred in other cities—had succeeded in for cing the Marcoses to seek refuge in Uncle Sam’s arms. On Tuesday, February 25, at 10:46 a. m., Corazon C. Aquino was sworn in as President of the Philippines at the Club Filipino in the upper-class enclave of Greenhills, the first woman to lead the nation. Addressing Filipinos as her “beloved brothers and sisters,” she declared: “It is fitting and proper that, if rights and liberties of our people were taken away at midnight fourteen years ago, the people should recover those lost rights and liberties in the full light of day…. It took the brutal murder of Ninoy to bring about a unity so strong and the phenomenon of people power. We became exiles in our own land—we Filipinos who are at home only in freedom—when Marcos destroyed the Republic fourteen years ago.” Not to be outdone, Marcos also proclaimed himself president on the same day, from a balcony in Malacañang, surrounded by his family and a coterie of faithful “loyalists,” as these die-hard Marcos followers came to be known. By then he had already been persuaded by U. S. Senator Paul Laxalt to resign. Laxalt, when asked by the dictator what he should do, had replied: “I think you should cut and cut cleanly. The time has come.” Offered asylum in the U. S., later that same day, he, Imelda, their family, and a few close friends were flown by helicopter to Clark Air Force Base, the nce transferred to a plane that took them to Honolulu. Among the conjugal dictators’ luggage were $200,000 in gold bullion, $1 million in pesos, and Pampers boxes crammed with jewelry that in cluded a gold crown and three tiaras of precious gems. Those heady February days not only signaled a new level of political consciousness—however temporary that may have been in hindsight—but resurrected and extended the collective stirrings of nationalism generated by the 1896 revolution against Spain—Asia’s first against a colonial power"

Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos desired more than anything else to be seen as great historical figures but wound up being, sadly, merely hysterical and much-ridiculed characters. The Deluge The night of the 25 th, anti-Marcos crowds that had gathered by the gates of the palace burst through, overwhelming the loyalists who had stood guard. Long denied access to the palace, they ran through the corridors of power, partly in glee and partly in astonishment that they had even been able to penetrate the in ner sanctum. They could have easily plundered and like Visigoths ransacked Malacañang but, perhaps mindful of history, did relatively little damage, except for some paintings of the couple that were defaced, furniture damaged, and various knickknacks taken as souvenirs. That the president was seriously ill was evident in the mini-clinic that had been set up with sophisticated medical equipment, cabinets full of vitamins and medications, disposable diapers, and a dialysis machine. In the basement two hospital rooms had been set up, one of them clearly meant for surgery. Imelda’s quarters bore quantifiable evidence of her mania for expensive items—a never- ending at tempt to fill the needs of a deprived childhood. Her mirrored dressing room was filled with hundreds of costly silk dresses, baskets crammed with soaps from around the world, and row upon row of expensive French perfumes. Elsewhere were a half-dozen wide-screen television sets, stereo units, and a double freezer full of frozen steaks. In her bedroom stood a ten-foot high closet packed with her nightgowns. Underneath her twelve-foot-wide bed, according to the late journalist and National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin, were bundles “of gold-chain necklaces and a receipt for over two million dollars from the jewelers Van Cleef and Arpels…. Mrs. Marcos’s private bathroom was equipped with a 15-foot-square sunken bathtub, mirrored ceilings, gallon bottles of a custom-made French perfume called First Lady. And no fewer than five Italian bathrobes…. A tally would reveal that Imelda left behind three thousand panties, three thousand pairs of shoes, hundreds of black bras [one of which was bulletproof], and five fur coats, in cluding minks.” S HE R EIGNS B UT D OES N OT R ULE Corazon C. Aquino, or Cory to the public, was an unlikely president, with no experience of holding or even running for political of fice. She was, in short, not a trapo, an acronym for tra ditional po litician and a pun on the Tagalog word that means “rag.” Her non-trapo status was a major reason for her immense popularity at the outset of her term. A conservative Catholic and a member of one of the richest Chinese-mestizo clans of the country, the Cojuangcos, she had been educated in the United States, studying mathematics and obtaining a degree in French at the private College of Mount Saint Vincent in New York City. Her presidency began auspiciously enough, with a repudiation of the 1973 Constitution and the abolition of the legislature. By claiming legislative powers for her of fice, she had de facto established a revolutionary government. In effect, Aquino could rule by decree, just as Marcos had. Unlike the Marcos regime, however, President Aquino and her administration encouraged the creation of what the media referred to as “democratic space” by taking several measures, such as the restoration of the writ of habeas corpus; leaving the courts free to operate once more with out executive or any political in terference; the repeal of repressive Marcos-era labor laws; the establishment of a commission, headed by respected for mer senator and political prisoner José Diokno, to in vestigate those responsible for human rights abuses under the Marcos dictatorship; and the convening of a constitutional convention to replace the 1973 document with another constitution. The long-suppressed frustrations, aspirations, and exuberance of the public found release when more than twenty dailies sprung up, in cluding the revival of the two venerable English-language newspapers, The Manila Times and the Lopez-owned The Manila Chronicle. What had begun as an anti-Marcos tabloid, Mr. & Mrs., in corporated with the weekly Philippine Inquirer to become the Philippine Daily Inquirer two months before the to ppling of the Marcos regime. It soon became the largest-circulation English-language daily in the nation. To deal with local of ficials that had come to power during the Marcos era, the Aquino administration simply replaced them with temporary of fice-holders, known as Officers-in-Charge, or OICs. It was a sweeping act, perhaps too sweeping, resulting of ten in throwing out the baby with the bath. Critics pointed out that, while it was true there were many who had been mere mouthpieces of the Marcos KBL machine, not all were political hacks or in competent; many had won legitimately and enjoyed popular support. The removal of previous of fice holders didn’t mean their dropping out of the political scene. They had an opportunity to reclaim their lost posts during the nationwide elections for all political of fices, from governorships to the revived bicameral legislature, from barangay councilor to mayor, held in May 1987 and many, in fact, did. For a while, democratic space resulted in a détente, albeit uneasy, between the military and both the Communist New People’s Army, and the secular Moro National Liberation Front"

For a while, democratic space resulted in a détente, albeit uneasy, between the military and both the Communist New People’s Army, and the secular Moro National Liberation Front. In recognition of their struggle against Marcos, political prisoners were released, the most prominent being the NPA head, Bernabe Buscayno, and the CPP founder, José Maria Sison, much to the dismay of hard-liners within Aquino’s Cabinet and the military. Sison, who had spent nine years in prison and had endured to rture, was a much-sought-after speaker by various civic and university groups, before leaving on a speaking tour of Europe. He decided to seek asylum in the Netherlands in 1987, after being warned by friends that returning to the islands would be detrimental to his health. Buscayno and several other members of the left or ganized a political party Partido ng Bayan (Pn B, Party of the Nation) to campaign for congressional seats in the 1987 elections. Forming a coalition with other cause-or iented groups that called itself Alliance for a New Politics, Pn B disdained the traditional palabas for its election rallies and appealed to the electorate on the strength of their progressive platform. Hampered by a shoestring budget, the Pn B slate of senatorial candidates, in cluding an ex-beauty queen turned guerrilla, fared poorly. And in a sign that democratic space was viewed as a charade by extremist right-wing groups, Buscayno survived an assassination at tempt, though two companions were killed and shrapnel permanently lodged in his back. Buscayno credited his in stincts as a guerrilla, which he said enabled him to in stinctively get down on the floor of the automobile he was in when shots rang out. Two other well-known Pn B candidates led less charmed lives and were assassinated: Lean Alejandro, a young, charismatic for mer student activist at the University of the Philippines and Rolando Olalia, an important left-wing labor leader and or ganizer. Nevertheless, the left viewed the post-Marcos democratic space as an opportunity to test new ideas and approaches. The NPA negotiated with the government for a sixty-day cease-fire while the CPP allowed for more vigorous in ternal debate, mindful of its costly blunder during the snap elections. Undertaking self-criticism of its boycott position, in its publication of May 1986, Ang Bayan, the leadership was contrite: “Where the people saw in the February 7 snap presidential election a chance to deliver a crippling blow on the Marcos regime … the Executive Committee of the Party Central Committee saw it merely as ‘a noisy and empty political battle’ among factions in the ruling classes. And when the aroused and militant people moved spontaneously but resolutely to oust the hated regime last February 22-25, the party and its for ces were not there to lead them.… A recent assessment conducted by the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the Central Committee characterized the boycott policy as a major political blunder.” The debates within provoked in ternecine struggles, as the leadership at tempted to define its policies and chart new directions in the post-Marcos era. The underground left’s image of solidarity was further undermined by revelations that in the waning years of the Marcos dictatorship, the NPA conducted bloody purges of its ranks in Mindanao. Seized by a vengeful paranoia, and with reports of government agents having in filtrated their ranks, NPA commands executed a number of their own, suspecting them to be, in their parlance, “deep penetration agents.” The movement was further shaken with arrests of top CPP figures in 1988, the result of much-improved military in telligence, aided undoubtedly by dissent within the CPP/NPA. Extending the same olive branch to the MNLF, the Aquino government allowed exiled MNLF leader Nur Misuari to return. The military and many impartial observers viewed this as a tactical mistake, for the MNLF was moribund and Misuari’s return revived it; the for mer university professor was hailed practically as a conquering hero when he went on tour of southern Mindanao, with a large and impressive heavily armed entourage. Casting aside the arrangement made during the Marcos era, another plebiscite was held in 1989, with the aim of creating an autonomous region for Filipino Muslims, as or iginally envisioned by the Tripoli Agreement. This time around, only Basilan, Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi out of thirteen provinces voted to be part of what was to be called the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), to be governed by Misuari. That Misuari accepted the holding of a plebiscite and the resulting geographical area that was much smaller reflected both the fact that the MNLF was not as potent as before and that the years in exile had made him more realistic in his and his or ganization’s aspirations. Recovering the Loot As early as 1969, the CIA determined that Marcos had already stolen several hundred million dollars, and, by 1972, other American of ficials had become aware that Marcos was raiding the national treasury. Nothing was said, however, to avoid embarrassing an ally. Estimates of how much the Marcoses had stolen from the government ranged from $5 billion to $10 billion. Due to the unwelcome spotlight placed on its secretive banking practices, the Swiss government promised to freeze all Marcos accounts even as the Aquino government, using documents seized that linked the Marcoses to numerous bank accounts and major expenditures, determined to recover at least $6 billion in assets it accused the Marcoses of unlawfully amassing. To take charge of the recovery efforts, the Aquino administration set up the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)"

To take charge of the recovery efforts, the Aquino administration set up the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). The PCGG itself however became mired in charges of corruption and of in dividual of ficers turning sequestered corporations into their private fiefdoms. The most publicized at tempt to recover the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses was the trial of Imelda in New York’s federal district court in May of 1990. (Ferdinand had died in 1989, so his widow had to undergo the humiliation of a public trial alone, a trial monitored closely by the PCGG.) She had been in dicted the year before, with the government charging her and Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi arms dealer alleged to have helped the Marcoses in their financial shenanigans. The four-count racketeering in dictment centered on the purchase of four choice Manhattan buildings with cash illicitly acquired—a crime under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, the scope of which in cludes pursuing criminal enterprises that operate outside the jurisdiction of the United States when part of the ill-gotten profits are then in vested or otherwise used within the U. S. The act was or iginally meant as a key legislative bill aimed at or ganized crime syndicates such as the Mafia. The trial lasted three months, the government prosecutors portraying the complexities of the case that in cluded 95 witnesses, 5,700 pages of testimony, and 300,000 documents of fered to the court as possible evidence. Prosecution witnesses painted a damaging portrait of money laundering of huge sums from the Philippines, cronyism, kickbacks from local and for eign businesses, as well as extravagant purchases that in cluded jewelry and artworks. In the end, however, the jury acquitted Imelda and Khashoggi on all counts—on July 3 rd, her 60 th birthday, no less—testament to Imelda’s lawyers’ persuasive use of the blame-the-dead-man defense, and to the prosecution’s in ability to present a coherent and convincing picture of sustained criminal activity. To celebrate her acquittal, Imelda, throughout the proceedings the very picture of the demure and retiring widow, proceeded immediately to St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, not far from the Crown Building, one of the four properties her family was believed to have owned. Surrounded by photographers and a coterie of loyalists, she made her way on padded knees to the altar and of fered thanks to the Almighty and, presumably, to Ferdinand for his in tervention from beyond the grave. Democratic Space versus Military Restlessness Marcos may have fled the country, but thousands of his supporters remained visible and voluble, taking advantage of the restoration of civil liberties to constantly criticize the Aquino administration. Barely two months after the February uprising, on April 12, twenty thousand Marcos supporters gathered on the streets of Manila and demanded his return. Though pro-Cory supporters had turned out as well, it was a peaceful if raucous demonstration, with the two sides kept apart by the police. The loyalists would stage such scenes sporadically during Aquino’s tenure, but they were never a serious threat to her government’s stability. The most pressing threat the Aquino government faced, with its unlikely coalition of centrists, left-wingers and right-wingers, was from the military, now rechristened New Armed Forces of the Philippines, a public- relations ploy meant to in dicate that men in uniform were now more at tuned to a democratic society. It was a new military, not in the sense of having a renewed dedication to professionalism and respect for civilian rule but in the fact that the AFP was now disturbingly aware of its ability to take an active role in governance. Marcos of ten rewarded of ficers by assigning them to head non- military government agencies. With military expenditures becoming the biggest item of the national budget, the top brass had acquired a taste for the material benefits brought about by corruption, thanks to Marcos’s coddling of the generals he needed to prop his regime up. The discipline and professionalism that Magsaysay had in stilled in the ranks when he was dealing with the Huk rebellion had all but disappeared. Politicized, the military had grown from a pre- martial strength of 50,000 to 250,000 at its peak during the Marcos era and was no longer content to confine itself to the barracks. Henceforth, it would be impossible to put the genie back into the bottle. The two leaders of the aborted 1986 coup against Marcos that led ultimately to People Power, Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel V. Ramos, held powerful posts in the Aquino Cabinet. Enrile was kept on as defense secretary while Ramos was appointed chief of staff of the AFP: Insiders in the Marcos regime, they were now in siders in the Aquino government. Neither Enrile nor Ramos had any love for the Communists or the Moro rebels or any group that professed similar ideals. Additionally, RAM of ficers were lobbying for more of a say in running the government, through both Enrile and Ramos and their demands on how President Aquino was to govern. The military hardliners felt passionately that with out their support Cory would not have at tained the presidency, and they of ten reminded her of her debt of gratitude, her utang na loob, to them. They viewed with contempt and in creasing alarm the Aquino government’s efforts to reach out to both the Communist in surgency and the Moro rebellion.

A general amnesty was proclaimed for NPA guerrillas, and many did come down from the hills, giving up their arms and at tempting to take up the civilian life once more. On November 24, 1986, a sixty-day ceasefire was agreed to by the government and the CPP/NPA. The day prior, Enrile had been sacked by Aquino; the defense secretary had made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Aquino’s policies and openly voiced his sympathy with military malcontents. In early 1990, the government had him arrested on charges of rebellion and murder but the for mer defense secretary easily beat the charges. Enrile’s in ability to accept Aquino’s leadership proved symptomatic of the unusual restiveness afflicting the military. One military of ficer likened Aquino’s conciliatory efforts to “castration.” In all there were seven at tempts to to pple her government, all ending in failure, primarily due to Ramos’s fidelity to Aquino. Nothing showed the in fluence of the hardliners within the administration more than the way the first coup at tempt was dealt with. On July 6, 1986, civilian loyalists and about 300 soldiers, in cluding some generals, took over the historic Manila Hotel. Arturo Tolentino, who had been Marcos’s last vice president, stood on the hotel driveway and declared himself acting president. That it was a farce more than anything else was perhaps in dicated by a quip uttered by Manuel Collantes, Tolentino’s ersatz minister of for eign affairs: “For me, the revolution ended as soon as room service stopped.” Assured by Defense Secretary Enrile that “we are not out to humiliate, punish, or embarrass any of you,” the soldiers gave up and the loyalists, most of them from Manila’s rougher neighborhoods, left the premises. So as not to be seen as letting them off too lightly, Ramos or dered the military miscreants to do thirty push-ups—with him joining in. A telling in dicator that the military seemed to be operating beyond Aquino’s control was in January of 1987. Government security for ces fired into the ranks of farmers, student activists, and laborers, who were marching on Malacañang to demand genuine land reform. Thirteen protesters lost their lives and thirty-nine were wounded. The bloody in cident came to be known as the “Mendiola Massacre,” referring to the nearby bridge that had also been the contested site of the 1971 First Quarter Storm. In protest, the head of the Commission on Human Rights, ex-Senator José Diokno, and his deputy resigned the day after. The killings further undermined popular support for Cory—and ate away at the space her government had been granted by the underground left. The cease-fire with the NPA ended the month after the massacre, in early February 1987, when the CPP ruled out any extension. In turn, adopting a harder line and bowing to pressure from the army, Aquino called for a “to tal war” and declared that only victory, not compromise, would end the in surgency. Six more coup at tempts followed. One, staged on August 28, 1987, was led by Colonel Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan, a handsome and charismatic leader of RAM and a veteran of the counterinsurgency wars in Mindanao. The coup failed, and Honasan was arrested. But because of the widespread sympathy he had in the military, as well as with a large segment of the public that viewed him as a romantic freedom fighter, he escaped easily and continued to plague the Aquino government. Indeed, his hand, and that of RAM, could be seen in the most serious coup at tempt yet, on December 1, 1989, when 3,000 troops, spearheaded by elite units such as the Scout Rangers and the Marines, targeted Makati, the prime financial district of the country, and the site of exclusive gated communities and high-rise luxury hotels. The rebels for ced the closing of the airport (now named the Ninoy Aquino International Airport), commandeered two TV stations, and occupied military outposts through the metropolitan area. Aquino’s government survived after President George H. W. Bush or dered U. S. jets to fly over the city and signaled to the rebels that the United States would shoot down any rebel aircraft. The nearly successful week-long grab for power resulted in 190 dead and close to 600 wounded. It cost the economy an estimated $1.2 billion and dampened for eign-in vestor confidence that had been rising steadily since 1986. With Aquino in power and perceived to be sympathetic after all to U. S. concerns, Washington stuck to the same goals it had had for nearly a century: the preservation of U. S. military and economic in terests for which it was willing to oppose any popular movement that might undermine those in terests. It continued to encourage Aquino to deal with the in surgency through military means, reduce or eliminate the leftists in her government, allow for the retention of the bases, and further encourage free enterprise. One more sign that the Aquino government was reverting to Marcos-era policy when it came to the seemingly in tractable in surgency was its approval of the military-created, Orwellian-sounding Citizen Armed Force Geographical Units (CAFGUs). It was simply the CHDF of the Marcos regime being given a new name, with essentially the same responsibility: to augment regular army units in counterinsurgency work in areas where the NPA was believed to be operating. Fidel Ramos, now the defense secretary, oversaw their creation. Not surprisingly, the CAFGUs proved to be as problematic as the CHDFs had been, with complaints about their abusive behavior being filed with disturbing regularity with the Commission on Human Rights. The Aquino government’s in creasing emphasis on military solutions to the in surgency and away from economic and social reform meant a resumption of the army’s dirty war, whose victims were mainly civilians"

Those appointed to draft the new constitution were mainly from the upper class, in cluding for mer legislators, judges, and politicians. One convenor was the in ternationally known film director Lino Brocka, who was from a working class family and known for his landmark social-realist melodramas that had bedeviled Imelda Marcos, whose vision of cinema was largely defined by works such as The Sound of Music, one of her favorite films. She believed Filipino cinema should be a repository of the “good, the beautiful, and the true” and that it should make people elsewhere want to be Filipinos. In this light, social realist films were a no-no. But precisely due to repressive policies, the 1970 s and early 1980 s were a golden age for Filipino films, when a whole slew of filmmakers—in cluding Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, Marilou Diaz, Eddie Romero, Mike de Leon, Peque Gallaga, and Tikoy Aguiluz—created works that challenged government control and were in sightful critiques of contemporary Philippine society. Brocka resigned before the final version of the constitution was drafted, charging that the convention seemed in tent on restoring the old guard, one that had been displaced by the Marcoses, rather than in corporating much-needed reforms. He felt that the working-class and the peasantry were hardly represented, if at all. To him, it was the Malolos Congress once again, dominated by society’s elite. And in deed, the proposed constitution—ratified in February of 1987— adhered closely in many respects to the 1935 model, with the switch back to a presidential system (but this time, with only a single six-year term) and a bicameral legislature. Voters could once again elect a president and a vice president from different parties. A human rights commission was created, a bill of rights in corporated, and checks placed on authoritarian rule. There were however at least three significant differences. The first had the Constitution providing for party-list representation, a concession to those who, like Brocka, had criticized the convention for excluding the less for tunate from its framers. The party-list feature allows for legislative representation for under- represented segments of society, such as the urban poor, women, labor, peasants, and in digenous communities. Voters in each Congressional district can cast two votes: one for a district representative who will represent the constituents, and the other for a party-list or ganization, which has a national platform rather than a local one. If a party-list group obtains at least 2 percent of the to tal votes cast nation-wide, it then lands a seat in Congress, with a maximum of three seats. This system first went into effect with the 1998 national elections, when thirteen party-list or ganizations won seats. The new constitution also mandated making the country nuclear-free, as long as this was “consistent with national in terest.” But the most significant difference relative to Philippines-U. S. relationship now elevated any agreement between the United States and the Philippines regarding the fate of U. S. bases to treaty status, which meant it was subject to ratification by the Philippine Senate. During her presidential campaign, Aquino had been in favor of terminating the bases’ lease. It was one way of establishing her nationalist credentials and distinguishing herself from Marcos. Once she had ascended to the presidency, however, and faced with constant pressure from the U. S., hard-liners within her cabinet, and the military, she changed her tune, saying merely that she wanted keep her options open. An in terim bases agreement was drawn up in late 1988 after seven months of negotiations, with Secretary of State George Shultz and Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus signing for their respective governments. The United States agreed to pay $481 million for the bases over two years. At the end of this in terim agreement, the Senate would then decide the fate of the bases. And on September 16, 1991, with nationalist solons, particularly those with the Liberal Party, carrying the day, the Senate rejected the treaty. It was a momentous occasion, a cause for celebration among all those who believed that the presence of U. S. soldiers on Philippine soil, begun in 1898, demeaned the country’s sovereignty. The practical effect would only be on Subic Bay Naval Base, for earlier that year, Mt.

The practical effect would only be on Subic Bay Naval Base, for earlier that year, Mt. Pinatubo had erupted spectacularly, after six hundred years of dormancy, effectively shutting down Clark Air Force Base. The Economy The Marcos government’s programs, which relied heavily on in ternational lending agencies, had in creased the country’s external debt to $28.5 billion, giving the country the dubious distinction of being among the ten most in debted countries in the world. Overspending on the elections, crony capitalism, bureaucratic corruption, and the flight of capital that in tensified after Senator Aquino was assassinated left the state coffers drained. In the last five years of the Marcos regime, per capita in come fell by close to 20 percent, and the prices of basic commodities had risen in an in flationary spiral that threatened to go out of control. As a result, poverty levels rose, with close to 60 percent of the rural population living below the poverty line. In Metropolitan Manila alone, 1.5 million families were similarly afflicted. With an average population growth rate of nearly 3 percent, poverty levels were sure to in crease even more, straining barely adequate government resources and services. This rendered the dilemma facing the Aquino government—how to service its external debt—an acute one. As elsewhere in other Third World countries facing enormous debt, some segments of Philippine society argued that the debts in curred under the Marcos regime should be repudiated, as these benefited his cronies more than the country, and financed projects that should never have been undertaken. Aquino’s minister of economic planning, Solita Monsod, made a strong case for this, within the larger context of achieving social justice and reducing the yawning in equities between the haves and the have-nots. Cardinal Sin argued as well for selective debt repudiation; to do otherwise would be “morally wrong,” given the penury of the people and the country. A case in point was the Bataan Nuclear Plan, which had been mothballed. Daily in terest payments alone amounted to $300,000. But the neoliberals within her cabinet, primarily Jaime Ongpin, her in fluential and respected finance minister, and Central Bank Governor Jobo Fernandez in sisted that the nation meet all its external obligations. Default was not an option, they argued, if the country wished to remain a credible part of the global financial market. This meant payments of $3.5 billion a year, or 10 percent of the GDP. At the end of the day, Ongpin, Fernandez, and their allies convinced the Aquino administration to borrow even further, thus allowing in ternational lending agencies such as the International Monetary fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank to help shape the government’s economic policies. The strategy in essence was that through in creased borrowing the economy would be stimulated, which would in turn in crease revenues that would then drive down the debt. It was also a precondition to approval of the $10 billion Multilateral Aid Initiative (MAI), primarily backed by the United States, as well as Japan and other creditor nations. It was a precondition similar to the strings-at tached aid that the U. S. extended to the spectacularly ruined country right after World War II. Combining payments on both for eign and domestic debt during Aquino’s tenure ate up almost 50 percent of government revenues—leaving little for in frastructure, poverty alleviation and other social programs, and education. Poverty levels did decline somewhat, from close to 50 percent down to 46.5 percent, but this was nowhere close to significant. Beginning with the Marcos years, when the export of labor overseas was actively promoted, remittances from the expanding Filipino diaspora helped soften the blows of a stagnant economy. During Aquino’s six-year term, remittances averaged $4 billion a year. That figure has risen in the first decade of the twenty-first century to close to $16 billion. The Failure of Land Reform A major cause of the in surgency has always been the in equitable distribution of agricultural land. More than a quarter of arable land was owned by less than four percent of land-owning families. The desired end was simple—to break up huge, landed estates—but the means to that end were not. Making land transfers work meant fair compensation for the owners and setting up a whole government network of financing and farm-production distribution. Where was the money to come from? More importantly, would the landed families, long a part of the historical ruling elites, agree? While the 1987 constitution recognized the need for “an agrarian reform program,” the specific provision was less than compelling: To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental or equity considerations, and subject to payment of just compensation. In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the rights of small landowners. The State shall further provide in centives for voluntary land sharing. Instead of using her emergency powers to in terpret the constitution and apply far-reaching changes with regards to land reform, Aquino deferred to the newly elected Congress. By allowing its members to set the “priorities and reasonable retention limits,” she essentially left it to a landlord-dominated body to legislate against its own in terests. It wouldn’t and didn’t"

By allowing its members to set the “priorities and reasonable retention limits,” she essentially left it to a landlord-dominated body to legislate against its own in terests. It wouldn’t and didn’t. The clearest and most eloquent in stance of the failure of Aquino’s land reform program lay in the fact that Hacienda Luisita, her family’s huge 6,000-plus hectare hacienda, where the family’s racehorses received better care than the tenant laborers, remained in tact. She had promised in her campaign that the hacienda would be affected. There was a nominal at tempt to in corporate the hacienda so that it became the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated, with 33 percent of the stock to be turned over to the tenant farmers, but over a period of thirty years. The Cojuangco family would retain the rest of the stock. In the end, Cory was unable, or unwilling, to act against the in terests of her clan. By the time her Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program had metamorphosed into the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, it had lost much of its bite. Instead of more than 27 million acres being subject, only 9.4 million acres would be affected. There was a corresponding decline from 3 million farmer-beneficiaries to fewer than 2 million. And most significantly, no sugar and coconut lands were to be subject to land reform, essentially leaving most of the major agribusiness plantations untouched. Land-owning lawmakers, and lawmakers beholden to wealthy landowners in their districts, heaved a sigh of relief in private even as they publicly praised the law as a landmark. Such emasculation made it possible for Congresswoman Hortensia Starke, a wealthy, prominent sugar planter from Negros Occidental and outspoken opponent of land reform, to walk dramatically through the Congress session hall in July of 1988, clad in an expensive ball gown and twirling a parasol—a clear “I don’t give a damn” in the face of the popular clamor for land. What She Hath Wrought The problems facing Corazon C. Aquino when she took of fice were seemingly in numerable, in tractable, and multilayered. Viewed as a manager and administrator, she seemed helpless, nowhere more so than in the energy sector. With no coherent and sustained policy, regular blackouts plagued residential and in dustrial areas, driving up the cost of doing business in the country and discouraging potential in vestors. Infrastructure was left to deteriorate. And the economy, after rebounding in the first two years of her term, started to decline. Poverty levels thus remained substantially high. A major factor in the continuing high levels of poverty was her administration’s commitment to paying in full the country’s for eign debt, essentially continuing Marcos’s policy of automatically appropriating from the national budget the full amount to service the debt due each year. As a result, from 1986 to 1993, according to economist Walden Bello in a 2009 article for the Philippine Daily Inquirer examining her economic legacy shortly after her death that year, “some 8 to 10 percent of the Philippines GDP left the country in debt-service payments adding up to a to tal of nearly $30 billion—an appalling sum, especially considering that the Philippines’ external debt was only $21.5 billion.” In contrast, Bello pointed to Argentina’s President Norberto Kirchner who, in 2002, confronted with bankruptcy caused in the main by debt repayments, decided to repay only 25 cents out of every dollar owed. In spite of in itial resistance from the creditors, they eventually agreed, and Argentina, able to reduce capital outflow, “grew by an average of 10 percent between 2003 and 2008.” While the more in sidious forms of crony capitalism were discontinued, as were the monopolistic mechanisms for sugar and coconut, Aquino’s government didn’t quite know what to do with all the corporations the Marcos regime had controlled, either through heavy subsidies or outright ownership. Through the Assets Privatization Trust under the management of the PCGG, at tempts were made to sell off these assets, at tempts complicated by legal wrangling, in ternal disputes, and allegations that the PCGG itself was becoming corrupt. Complicating and rendering the process of governance even more difficult was a military that always seemed on the verge of taking over—a threat that kept the Aquino administration off balance throughout and discouraged for eign in vestment. And there was the old guard, the pre-martial law oligarchy, slowly reinserting itself into power, and reviving their for tunes (both political and financial) that had been put on hold by the Marcos regime. What began seemingly as a revolution wound up as a restoration. Be that as it may, Cory Aquino did mediate a peaceful transition to a post- Marcos era, a housewife turned midwife. Free speech, an of ten licentious press, courts liberated from the yoke of executive in terference: all were hallmarks of the democratic processes she had revived, along with the centrality of the ballot box.

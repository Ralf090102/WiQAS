Architecture in the Philippines also in forms the perceptive observer about the country’s history since there are functioning examples of architecture from each era in almost every town in the country. Much of the rural population still lives in a bahay kubo (nipa or palm house), which long preceded the Spandiards’ arrival, they worship in a Spanish­style church located on the town plaza, and conduct public business in American­style municipal buildings. Meanwhile, the country’s modern suburbs have business districts and shopping malls that are built in accordance with modern in ternational architectural trends. This discussion of Philippine architecture starts with the family home and then discusses the wider community and the country’s religious and public lives, while always noting the impact of various historical styles and in fluences. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY The current housing of the country’s national minorities and that of many rural farm families across the country provide an excellent look into the types of housing that existed long before European contact. Other than the cave dwellings of some early peoples whose archeological remains have been discovered in the Tabon caves on the island of Palawan and the lean­tos of nomadic hunters and gatherers, Filipinos have long made sturdy houses that were well adapted to local conditions and needs. The primary characteristic Page 78 of pre­Hispanic housing is the impact of the geographical and climatic environment on both the design of the housing stock and the materials used in construction"

The primary characteristic Page 78 of pre­Hispanic housing is the impact of the geographical and climatic environment on both the design of the housing stock and the materials used in construction. The clearest example of the environment’s impact is found on the northern island group of the Batanes, where the Ivatan people build strong for tresslike limestone houses that can with stand the fierce monsoons that annually ravage the northern Philippine coast. Other peoples have specialized housing needs, such as the seafaring Samal people of the southern Sulu archipelago who build their houses above the water on top of tall poles to which their boats are tied. In the same area, the Badjao people build and live in boathouses where they spend virtually their entire lives since they rarely venture onto land. Among the many different minority peoples of the central Cordillera Mountains of Luzon Island, there are a number of stylistic variations in housing stock, but they all share the need to build houses that will of fer protection from the cold mountain climate. There are, the refore, some common characteristics of house construction, in cluding the use of wooden posts to raise the building off the cold and damp ground and wood planks for walls and floors to make the central one­room living compartment relatively airtight. As well, cooking is done in side the home, which gives added warmth, but with an absence of ventilation, the smoky in teriors create significant health problems, especially for young children. Among many groups, the steep roof above the living area is made into an in ternal rice storage area with the addition of a plank ceiling.

Among the people of the Cordillera, the common practice is to assemble their houses close to each other in groupings of ten to forty for mutual protection and as near to their fields as possible. Some groups pool their resources and build separate communal sleeping buildings for the older children and single adults of the village, leaving husbands and wives in private with the smaller children.1 In stark contrast to the homes of the mountain peoples is the bahay kubo that was traditionally used by lowland Filipinos and can still be found throughout the country. For most people in the Philippines, it is the heat of the tropics rather than the colder mountain air that poses a problem. Since there is less available wood in the lowlands than the mountains, the primary building material of the bahay kubo is bamboo as well as rattan and various grasses that are used for roofing. This housing structure is also raised above the ground on either wood or bamboo poles, which spares the in habitants of some of the effects of humidity. Unlike the mountain province houses, Page 79 Native hut (bahay kubo ) being constructed.

Still more air is allowed into the house through large open window areas that can be closed off with a framed woven mat of flattened bamboo. The roof of the bahay kubo is steep like the roofs of the mountain dwellers, but the purpose in the lowlands is not to create a rice storage area above the living quarters, but to allow hot air to rise away from the in habitants. It is also common to have a small porch area in the front of the house that serves as a foyer and assists in keeping the house cool as does the overhang from the sloped roof. Meanwhile, in ternal partitions are kept to a minimum to further allow the air to circulate freely. In most homes, there is a main area, or sala, where the children play and the family eats and sleeps. A separate area, usually in the rear of the house, is reserved for cooking and cleaning. Because the bahay kubo is so open, the cooking smoke found in the mountain houses is never a problem. During the rainy season, the raised house is immune from flooding, while water quickly slides off the sloped roof. Religious beliefs have long been a part of house construction and went into determining the site, time to build, and position of the house. There were rituals that had to be conducted before work was started and many details that had to be followed, such as making sure that the number of steps in a staircase is not divisible by three, which is a bad luck number, and cutting bamboo only at certain times of the year to avoid misfortune.

While the bahay kubo was usually not decorated for religious purposes, the homes of mountain people frequently in corporated the skulls of water buffalo and sometime of humans killed in battle. Muslims in the south also decorated the exterior of their homes, especially their large ancestral homes, with curved roofs and woodcarvings in religious motifs. Even to day, it is not uncommon for Filipinos to in vite the local parish priest to visit a new home and to give a blessing for the house and its occupants. When the Spanish first arrived, they built multilevel homes and government buildings out of stone until the frequent earthquakes taught them the value of lowland Filipino architecture. The resulting buildings soon developed into a style called mestizo (mixed blood) architecture. These structures, the bahay na bato (house of stone), were only built two floors high and utilized house posts that in terlocked with crossbeams and only used stone for the ground level, which closed off and allowed for the use of the space underneath the living area, while the second floor living area used wood for its walls.

Whichever structural style was adopted, the Spanish­in fluenced homes were conspicuous in their use of room partitioning, grand monumental staircases of up to two meters in width, and aesthetic additions such as iron grillwork, glass, or thinly sliced capiz shell sliding windows and the occasional tiled roof. The airiness of the Filipino home was retained by in corporating as many windows as possible and by the addition of a back porch area, both of which were on the second floor.2 The Iberian in fluence also had an impact on the physical development of the native Filipino communities in which the houses were located. One of Spain’s principle objectives was to Christianize the native people. To do this, the permanent town settlement was in troduced because the priests wanted as many of the natives as possible to live within the sound of the bells of the church. Beyond this general goal were detailed plans for the layout of the town. In each town, the focus of activity was the plaza, which was dominated by the church and the convento (priest’s house) located at one of the four sides of the plaza, usually the one with the highest elevation. When a town hall was later constructed, it was most of ten placed directly opposite the church, with the town’s market either adjacent to it or somewhere close by. The remaining two sides of the plaza were occupied either by permanent stores or the impressive homes of the town’s principal citizens.

The plaza was the location of almost all public affairs and of those religious activities not actually held in the church such as, perhaps, a religious play. Meanwhile, the town’s streets branched off from the church­dominated plaza and were laid out in a grid pattern that was imposed, in part, as an at tempt to rationalize the town population. The municipal area surrounding the plaza was known as the poblacion, while the other parts of the town branching off from the town center became known as barrios. As a result of this physical structuring, the to wns created during the Spanish colonial period soon fulfilled social, political, and economic roles in addition to the religious function that first led to their creation. The American period did not see any major changes in the country’s architecture with regard to housing other than the in troduction of the small single­family chalet housing style for the growing middle class and new building materials such as reinforced concrete and galvanized metal roofing.

The wealthiest of these subdivisions have their own churches and community centers and are near to shopping areas and restaurants, so the residents do not have to go far from home for their basic necessities and conveniences. Another development has been the appearance of prestigious apartments and condominiums located either in the suburbs of Makati or Mandaluyong and, to a lesser degree, along Manila Bay. The less well­to­do have access to a variety of apartment buildings, duplexes, and prefabricated homes, which at least of fer a measure of privacy and a sense of having one’s own space.

In a real sense, religion and the priests of missionary or ders, the Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, Jesuits, and Augustinian Recollects, played a crucial role in affairs of state, and their importance was mirrored in colonial architecture. Not only was the church the most impressive structure on every town’s plaza, the cathedral was one of the first structures erected in Manila, and the first stone building in the capital was the residence of Bishop Domingo Salazar. Structures for the civilian government were important too, but they were secondary to the church. The oldest surviving stone church is the Church of San Agustin in Manila, the construction of which was started in the mid­1580 s. Since then the building has survived a number of earthquakes and the devastation from the recapture of the city by American for ces in 1945. In addition, there are also a number of especially important churches in the country that are referred to as basilicas, in cluding the churches for the Santo Nino in Cebu, Jesus Nazareno in the Quiapo district of Manila, and the Manila Cathedral. Other large religious buildings were the monasteries that each of the missionary Page 83 The San Agustin Church in the old walled city is the oldest Christian church in Asia, completed in 1607.

These materials were readily available, and the local population was skilled in building with them. Over time, however, these early structures were replaced with more permanent ones made of stone or, frequently, roughly hewn blocks of coral reef. The buildings were fashioned Page 84 in conformity with the reforms of the Council of Trent (1545–1563), which emphasized preaching’s central role for reform and in struction, so the architectural emphasis was on the strategic and elevated placement of the altar and pulpit. The front entrance of ten had a very large main door that was only opened on special occasions, such as the town fiesta, while smaller doors on either side served for everyday use. Most of the building’s decorative detail was placed in the front to maximize its impact when viewed from the plaza. The architectural style of an in dividual church seems to have been a function of what was in vogue when the building was constructed, with the earliest being in the baroque motif followed by neo­gothic and rococo (for exterior decoration) until the latter part of the nineteenth century when the eclectic revivalist style became fashionable. Whatever style was chosen, the walls of many churches were very thick, up to almost two meters in some cases, to secure them against the archipelago’s frequent seismic activity. Buttresses of all shapes and sizes were also added to further improve the chances of surviving an earthquake.

In addition to calling the people to mass, the bells heralded special events such as marriages and funerals and were even used for a variety of secular purposes, in cluding warning people of a fire or an enemy raid. At night along some coasts, flares would be lit in one belfry after another to warn the next town when moro raiders approached. The priest’s house, the convento, was a separate structure to the side of or behind the church, but the two could be connected by a bridge or covered walkway. The convento usually had a stone first floor and a wooden second story but could be entirely of stone. While its primary function was as a residence, the convento was of ten much more, and it was built large to accommodate the priest’s many obligations and activities. For example, the priest was frequently called upon to host visiting of ficials so there had to be a number of bedrooms and a substantial cooking and dining area. As well, since church and state were a single enterprise in the Spanish world, the priest and his missionary activity was heavily subsidized by the Spanish crown.

While the Japanese victory in 1941–1942 caused relatively little property damage, the country’s liberation saw fierce destruction throughout the country. The nation’s churches were primary victims, since Japanese troops used churches as for tifications.

Locsin, the church is in the shape of an in verted bowl that is open all around its perimeter. Across the street is the campus’s Protestant chapel with its distinctive saddle­like structure that makes abundant use of windows. The redesign of the nation’s churches was given impetus in the 1960 s by Vatican II, which reversed the dictates of the Council of Trent with regard to the relationship between the priest and the congregation. Now the emphasis is on greater participation and visibility of the rites conducted at the altar. The dominating pulpit has disappeared, and the priest stands before the congregation with only a lectern in front of him. In some cases, such as in the Church of the Holy Sacrifice, the altar is placed in the middle of the circular church, and the priest must address the faithful in the manner of the ater in the round. While Protestantism entered the Philippines under the open religious policy of the American regime, it did not win the large numbers of converts that its missionaries sought. The principle Protestant structures are located in Manila and a few of the country’s other larger cities and to wns. In general, they follow the neo­Gothic style frequently associated with Protestant church buildings in the United States or are relatively nondescript in style.

The most in teresting recent development in church architecture has come from the rapidly growing in digenous Christian church Iglesia ni Cristo (INC or Church of Christ), which was started by Felix Manalo in 1914. After the war and until to day under Manalo’s son Erano, who now heads the church, the INC has pioneered a truly stunning form of architecture thanks to the work of a number of talented architects such as Juan Nakpil, Carlos Santos Viola, and Raul Villanueva. In 1971, the church even created its own construction firm to assure uniformity in the church’s buildings from its cathedral and administrative center in Quezon City to much smaller structures all of which employ exterior neo­Gothic vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, in terlocking trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as to wers and spires that seem to shoot into the sky, giving each building an imposing presence that its true size might not otherwise warrant.

In the Filipino Muslim architectural tradition, the first mosques were threetiered structures made of wood and bamboo, which resembled Hindu tem­ Page 87 ples found on the Indonesian island of Bali or the pagodas typical of Japan or China. Over time and with direct in fluence from the Middle East, the style changed to the more easily identifiable Islamic design of the on ion­shaped, domed building with to wers or minarets at the four corners. As a local modification, the top of the dome is frequently decorated with a crescent and star or nament and sometimes carved designs representing mythic creatures. While easily identifiable as mosques, those in the Philippines vary somewhat from buildings in the Middle East. The elevated pulpit (mimbar) found in the traditional mosque is either absent, having been replaced by a raised platform or a chair, or it is noticeably lower in height. Because of the region’s frequency of seismic activity, the minarets are lower, too, leaving the to wer more decorative than functional. Instead of using the minaret, the bilal (prayer reader) will call the faithful to prayer by standing in side the mosque while facing the mihrab (prayer niche) that is in the direction of Mecca and beating special drums to make the announcement.

In a manner similar to differences in Spanish churches, there are two types of mosques. The true mosque hosts Friday noon prayer sessions, sermons, and special ceremonies and is a large permanent structure built on a stone foundation and located near water. These buildings can accommodate at least forty people. Meanwhile, the lesser structures, which are referred to as either ranggar or laggal depending on the ethnic group, are on the level of a chapel. Afternoon prayer sessions can be held there for the convenience of the villagers, especially during the Ramadan fasting season, but these buildings are not used for major religious ceremonies. Like Roman Catholic churches during the Spanish era, the mosque accomodates a number of activities and frequently has a school and library. The structure may have additional meeting rooms, and the prayer hall can be used for conferences and meetings.

Seven churches were located here, the most prominent being the San Agustin Church and the Manila Cathedral, as well as the residences of church of ficials and heads of the monastic or ders plus their monasteries.

There were six other colleges in the Intramuros, but caution should be advised when reading the word college, since these in stitutions were not always what would to day be considered colleges, but were boarding schools and seminaries until the nineteenth century, at which time Filipinos were also admitted. The two most prominent colleges that opened to Filipino students were the Jesuit school the Ateneo de Manila and the Universidad de Santo Tomas.

It was from these Filipino neighborhoods that the various districts of the contemporary city of Manila, such as Paco, Tondo, Quiapo, and Ermita, would eventually be created. In addition, there was one section of the city reserved for the Chinese, who were essential to the galleon trade that linked Spanish Mexico with China and provided Manila’s Spanish population with an abundant source of commercial in come. Despite their prominent role as the link between Canton and Manila, the Chinese were rigorously confined in their de facto ghetto, called the Parian, and could not travel to or reside in other parts of the archipelago. The primary reason for this restrictive policy was a desire to keep the Chinese focused exclusively on the profitable trade, but there were also security concerns because the Spaniards did not want a large alien population spreading throughout the islands and jeopardizing their control. Over time, some Chinese merchants did gain footholds in major provincial cities, and in the nineteenth century, their mestizo descendants were allowed to live in the countryside, which greatly accelerated the colony’s entry into the in ternational market economy after the decline of the galleon trade.

The advent of American rule hastened this trend and witnessed the in troduction of a new of ficial architectural style. As early as 1901, Governor William Howard Taft appointed Filipino architect Arcadio Arellano as a consultant to the new government, and he began to break from Spanish architectural traditions. Then, in 1904, Philippine commissioner William Cameron Forbes in vited noted American architect and city planner Daniel H. Burnham to visit the Philippines to redesign Manila. Burnham was asked to use his recent experience in Washington, D. C., where he updated and enlarged L’Enfant’s or iginal schema for the nation’s capital. Specifically, he was asked to apply that imperial and monumental style of architecture to the capital of this Asian outpost of the new American empire. Burnham prepared numerous detailed plans for a new government center, street system, parks, and waterways, and recommended William Parsons to carry the project through to its conclusion. Parsons was hired and served as consulting architect from 1905 to 1914, during which time he used his education at the Ecole des Beaux­Arts in Paris to bring the neoclassical or Greek revival style with its massive columns and steep marble stairwells to the Philippines.

These and many similar structures were heavily damaged during the fight to recapture Manila in 1945, but they were restored and continue to day to serve the Philippine government.8 Social change was slower in the provinces during the last years of Spanish rule because of the in fluence of the friars on political affairs and because the at tention of the government was focused on events in the capital. As a result, many to wns did not even have a casa real (town hall), since the parish priest oversaw local affairs and because scarce local funds were required for its construction.

Meanwhile, new provincial governments received executive of fice buildings, called kapitolyo, which mirrored the multiple uses made of the munisipyos, since they housed most of the of fices needed to conduct provincial affairs.

It was only in the closing decades of Iberian rule that there was a healthy push for school construction, but even then, most elementary schools in the provinces were small and shabbily constructed. By the close of Spain’s rule, it was estimated that only 4,000 to 5,000 students at tended school daily. The new American regime occupied these structures, sequestered many other buildings and rented out still others to begin a massive program of education even while thousands of schoolhouses were being built around the country. William Parsons designed fifteen basic floor plans for schools that ranged in size from one­room rural barrio schools, to elementary schools for municipalities, to large provincial capital high schools and technical schools. The schools were generally called Gabaldon schoolhouses after assembly­man Isauro Gabaldon, who authored the spending bill that got the construction program underway.

Nowadays, municipalities, as well as religious in stitutions, own cemeteries that provide a range of services to the family of the deceased. In more prosperous places, the new cemeteries became well­designed parks for the well­to­do. One such park is the Paco Cemetery built in Manila in 1823. This cemetery is circular in shape and has two concentric walls with niches for the dead and open spaces between for walkways and an elliptical chapel in the center. Similar cemeteries were created in a number of other prominent to wns in Ilocos Sur, Laguna, Albay, and Iloilo provinces. In the closing years of Spanish rule, the large La Loma cemetery was build just north of Manila. During the American period, the Chinese and the North cemeteries were opened on adjacent land, while South Cemetery was built in present­day Makati. These burial grounds in corporated a number of architectural styles for their walls and mausoleums, in cluding Chinese, neoclassic, Gothic, modern, and art deco"

This trend marks a cultural exchange between the American colonial influence and the evolving Filipino values regarding death and mourning.",

Page 94 CONTEMPORARY PHILIPPINE ARCHITECTS AND THEIR WORKS The recent development of Philippine architecture has been greatly enhanced by Filipino architects who studied in the United States or Europe and subsequently in troduced new styling. During the American colonial period, these new architects worked for the emerging commercial elite of the era, and they were particularly taken with the art deco styling of the Paris Ecole des Beaux­Arts. This stylistic in fluence can be seen in the 1928 sixstory Perez­Samanillo of fice building on Escolta Street designed by Andres Luna de San Pedro and Juan F. Nakpil, who gave the building a light and airy appearance because of the large windows they employed. Nakpil continued this style in his designs for the Administration Building and the Main Library of the University of the Philippines at its new campus in the Diliman area of Quezon City. Experimentation with new styles continued after 1945 and in cluded the sun­breaks of the in ternational style as seen in Carlos Arguelles’s horizontal aluminum baffles that shield the windows of the Phil Am Life Building"

Many of the new architects also took advantage of the strength of reinforced concrete to stretch the limits of cantilevered canopies and balconies. An example of this in novation is Angel E. Nakpil’s design of the triangular­shaped Lopez Museum, with its extensive use of cantilevered floors.14 Just when Philippine architects appeared to become a part of the in ternational mainstream of architectural currents, a particularly in novative man with only domestic training, Leandro V. Locsin, emerged and made his mark. Locsin used the latest materials but applied them to evoke in digenous building concepts and to give the appearance of floating volume. These characteristics are seen very clearly in his design of the massive Cultural Center of the Philippines in augurated in 1969. In a bit of acoustic daring, Locsin used concrete walls in stead of wood for the center’s Main Theater, and throughout the in terior, he made copious use of native designs and decorative materials, the most striking being large capiz shell chandeliers in the lobby. His other notable works combine mass with grace and in clude some of the most notable buildings in contemporary metro Manila’s financial center of suburban Makati from its Stock Exchange to the Ayala, Tuason, Sarmiento, L.

Another example of the in digenous adoption of Philippine architecture is the San Miguel Corporation’s of fice, designed by the Manosa brothers, Manuel, Jose, and Francisco. The design of the building was in spired by the rice terraces of the central Cordillera and so has tiered balconies edged by flower boxes filled with green shrubbery.16 This wedding of Filipino romanticism’s yearning for in digenous roots while using the latest in construction materials has yielded some buildings of legitimate beauty despite the metropolitan area’s headlong rush into a high­rise future. As the prestigious areas of Manila and the country’s other larger cities become developed with new high­rise of fice to wers and condominiums, more middle­class housing developments spread further into the countryside.

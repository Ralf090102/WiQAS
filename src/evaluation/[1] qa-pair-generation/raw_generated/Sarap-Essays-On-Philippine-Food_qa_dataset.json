Mr. & Ms. has pioneered the coverage of food in local magazine jour¬ nalism with weekly and yearly menu guides, annual food supplements, special issues on the best of Metro Manila's test kitchens, as well as features on couples who cook. In 1980 we published The Coconut Cook¬ book to show the many and varied ways of cooking with that very basic and versatile fruit, the coconut. In our efforts to \"cover\" food, we have always had an enthusiastic partner in Doreen G. Fernandez who, with her husband Wili, has been a regular food columnist of Mr. &Ms. since 1983. The food review column is a field of journalism in which they excel, an amazing feat considering that their professional lives have nothing to do with food (Doreen is an academician and Wili an in terior designer). Talk about food re¬ viewers and the first names that in evitably come to mind are Doreen and Wili Fernandez. For this collection of essays, however, Doreen was joined not by her husband, but by her good friend and colleague at the Ateneo, Edil- berto N. Alegre, a fellow explorer in the realm of food. They share an in terest in Philippine history, a boundless enjoyment of eating as adventure and a curiosity that has led them to the out-of-the-way, the ethnic, the odd, as well as to history books and their own childhood memories of food in the small town. Doreen Fernandez and Ed Alegre make an in teresting combination of Mr. and Ms., two academicians with complementary in terests, delv¬ ing into the nuances of food and eating, and writing about these with a zest that should make Sarap delicious reading. One point we must emphasize, too: food and the enjoyment of it know no gender, and the to getherness it promotes is very much part of the publishing philo¬ sophy of Mr. & Ms. With this book, we renew our commitment of excellence in pub¬ lishing to our readers. Not for them, nor for us, a coffee table book on a subject as essential as food, but a handy edition to uched up with the folksy art of Manuel D. Baldemor. We hasten to publish Sarap before much more of what defines our cuisine is engulfed by the fast-food culture or altered by for eign tastebuds. EUGENIA D. APOSTOL Publisher * vi i PREFACE come to be?

Eventually, we came to see food not only as something to be in gested to sustain life, or as a source of pleasure, but as a means of understanding what we are, what the Filipino is. Eating is the most ephemeral of our quotidian activities. A very small portion of our body is in volved, our buccal cavity. Beyond that it is alimentation, before that it is work. And yet what we choose to eat, how we prepare it to be eaten, how we serve or present the food, how we actually eat it, and how we feel about each of these steps, constitute a telling part of our culture. Although the at eps are common to all * vii people and to all peoples, the act is in dividual, and national, and is set in the context of a particular culture. Each person who cooks and who eats creates, and contributes to this most popular form of popular culture. These essays, written at different times under different impulses, and for different motives and publications, do not deal only with the food in the mouth, with the taste of it. They consider the whole process — from field and river to market, from market to kitchen, then to the table, and finally to the savoring. We have tried to place food in context, in its cultural setting. Thus the first part of the book is devoted to essays on the his¬ to rical dimension, considering the in fluences geographical and histori¬ cal that shaped Filipino food. The second part explores the words that speak of the food, and examines what they say, behind and beyond their denotative meanings. And the third and last group of essays explores food in its different settings — in markets, hometowns, city streets, festivals, restaurants, homes; in different regions, social classes and occasions. Food is thus treated as a cultural object, a domain which has its own way of fitting elements to gether. It is the particular fit which we have tried to discover, and in the discovery we have at tempted to unravel meaning. We confess to having had fun writing this book. Any place where there was food, we wanted to explore — talipapa, roadside stall, hole in the wall, plush restaurant. The data were gathered from the field, so to speak, and processed by lengthy discussion, and comparison with written accounts, when available. It was fed into our \"data bank\" — our food memory, our experiences consciously studied or unconsciously re¬ membered. It was the refore a case of the present colliding with the past, of past and present enriching each other and our understanding. The fun also derived from a love of food, and a desire to experience the unknown. Willing to try sawa (boa constrictor) and bayawak (iguana), chicken feet at the roadside or elvers at a restaurant; happy to eat with Bajaws and with chefs, with chopsticks or with bare hands, we were aware that food in the Philippines we had barely begun to explore, and were thrilled with the small and at times startling in terconnections we found. The essays were not or iginally written as parts of a book, but after a few years it became obvious that our particular concerns shaped the sundry essays which we were writing. One was fascinated by how our food taste was for med; the other, by the world of food-related words* both by food in its different manifestations and contexts. We both grew up in small to wns and carried as equipment the mixture of stability and curiosity that comes with small town life. Although certain of what we liked and disliked, we were also aware that there were other ways, • • • vm other cuisines, other possibilities, right in the country, outside of what we knew, and that beckoned us to explore, compare, understand. Our common concern was: what does food tell us about ourselves? Food not only in the context of history and language, but in the broader and deeper sense of being a fact of culture? How do we eat? What doe§ this mean? Why do we eat what we eat? Why do we have preferences, and how did we come to have them? What does the changing food scene imply? We ask questions, sense some answers, know that there are more questions to ask and more answers to find. We have not been to many parts of the country; there are many dishes we have not tasted. This is our first food book, and we know there will be others. Ultimately, we hope to write a book on the place of food in Philippine culture. For this venture, we in vited Manuel Baldemor, who has explored food in his paintings and his woodcuts, remembering as we have the * food of his childhood and his hometown, to join us with his graphic essays — not as illustrator, but as fellow discoverer. We in vite our readers as well to join the voyage. We want readers who cook, who like to eat, who enjoy reading about cooking and eating, who are curious about the subtext beneath our food. We ask them to join us in remembering food, in recalling its pleasures, in wondering about its meaning, and thus in considering food as not only for eating, but also as marker and in dicator, sign and symbol of the Filipino"

Alegre 11 October 1988 * ix *' Why Sinigang?, i ATHER than the overworked ado- bo (so of ten identified as the Philippine stew in for eign cookbooks), sinigang seems to me the dish most representative of Filipino taste. We like the lightly boiled, the slightly soured, the dish that in cludes fish (or shrimp or meat), vegetables and broth. It is adaptable to all tastes (if you don't like shrimp, then bangus, or pork), to all classes and budgets (even ayungin, in humble little piles, find their way into the pot), to seasons and availability (walang talong, mahal ang gabi? kangkong na langl). But why? Why does sinigang find its way to bare dulang, to for¬ mica-to pped restaurant booth, to gleaming ilustrado table? Why does one like anything at all? How is a people's taste shaped? Why Sinigang? 3 The Island Landscape Because of the geography of the Philippines — islands of all sizes strung through teeming seas — one would suspect that the pre-Hispanic Filipino turned first to the sea (rather than to the for est) for his food. From this, perhaps, comes our liking for fish and seafood, and our wanting it absolutely fresh: hito thrashing in a pail, shrimp still jumping in the basket, crabs so actively alive that they nip thumbs and have to be chased all over the kitchen. Most of us live near enough to sea or river or rice paddy to be able to demand this freshness, and from this evolved our cooking methods. The wisest and best way to handle food so fresh is to do as little as possible, not to mar its pristine quality, not to drown it in sauces and spices. Thus it may be eaten uncooked, like kilawing hipon or kinilaw na tanguingue. Thus too, the simplest of cooking methods: halabos na hipon, paksiiu na banak, in ihaw na tulingan, sinigang na bangus, pasi- ngaw. Gat, the late cartoonist, used to tell of a restaurant in Tondo where only steamed (pasingaiv) fish was served, with a secret-for mula dipping sauce. (The sawsawan is obviously necessary to such simple cooking.) To it, fishermen brought their catches, and in it fishermen- for-a-pastime rubbed elbows with fishermen-for-a-living, dock work¬ ers and journalists, all to have fish purely, perfectly steamed. Rice But still, why soured? Aside from the fact that sour broths are cooling in hot weather, could it be perhaps because the dish is meant to be eaten against the mild background of rice? Easy to plant and harvest, and allowing of more than one crop a year, rice is ubiquitous on the landscape. One can picture our ancestors settling down beside their rivers and finally turning to the cultivation of fields, with rice as one of their first steady crops. Rice to us is more than basic cereal, for as constant background, steady accompaniment, it is also the shaper of other foods, and of tastes. We not only sour, but salt (daing, tuyo, bagoong) because the blandness of rice suggests the desirability of sharp contrast. Rice can be ground into flour and thus the proliferation of puto: the mildly sweet putong Polo, the banana leaf-encased Manapla variety; puto filled with meat or flavored with ube; puto in cakes or wedges, white or brown, eaten with dinuguan or salabat. From rice flour too, comes bibingka, and just as breads mark Christ¬ mas for the German, and puddings for the Englishman, so puto and bibingka mean Christmas to the Filipino. After the dawn, chill of the Misa de Gallo, one looks for ward to emerging into a church patio redo- 4 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food lent with tempting smells of food cooking.

Or else there are the lavender-colored puto bumbong of malagkit and pirurutong rice, sprouting out of little bamboo tubes; or in Pampanga, the 4 nise-flavored putong lusong to be eaten with piping hot panara; or the potomaya and suman bodbod, the biko and putong sulot. Rice further lends itself to sweetening, and thus the suman of our fiestas — sa latik, sa lihiya, wrapped in coconut or banana leaf, in slabs, in cylinders, in pyramids — and such other kakanin as tamales, maja blanca, sapin-sapin, espasol, kutsinta. Rice is also found in such other forms as kiping, the lovely edible, decorations of the Quezon province fiesta in honor of San Isidro Labrador; buro, the relish of fermented rice mixed with fish and angkak; pinipig, which is to asted and served with chocolate or halo- halo, or made into such dishes as amp aw -pinipig, or the Ilongo Visayan bay e-bay e. We might add that rice washing, in traditional homes, is used as the broth for sinigang, and lovely broth it is too, slightly thick and malinamnam. The Coconut f Filipino memories are full of coconut-dreams: waving fancily- woven coconut fronds on a Palm Sunday morning; weaving balls and hats out of the dark-green leaves; lazily stripping the leaf midrib just for fun, or to make walis tingting; husking a nut, grating the meat, squeezing out gata; drinking buko water on a hot day and scraping out the translucent flesh; scrubbing a wide-planked floor to a gleam with coconut husk in a graceful, slipping-sliding motion; biting on a piece of sweet, crunchy ubud that just an hour before had been the heart of a tree; waking on a provincial morning to see out of the window the leaves of a whole grove languid in the breeze; listening to the tuba- gatherer tapping away on a swaying treetop. The coconut we have in common with other Asian lands and areas around the Pacific, and it has been called \"the Southwest Pacific's one dietary constant.\" In the Philippines, it finds use from birth to death, one might say. From the sap, one gets tuba, which is drunk young and mild (recommended to nursing mothers), or fermented and strong. The young nut, of course, is buko — the water drunk, the flesh nibbled, or scraped and put into drink, dessert or main dish. The Quezon pinais is a succulent combination of leaf-wrapped river shrimp and buko strips, simmered in buko water; the Visayan binakol has chicken, ginger and buko strips simmered in the nut itself; pancit buko has noodles of coconut. Why Sinigang? 5 The mature nut yields the fresh grated meat in dispensable to bibingka, puto bumbong, kutsinta. Squeezed, it yields gata, and here, as in the rest of Southeast Asia, we make distinctions between the cream (the first, thick kakang gata) and the \"second\" milk, because they are used differently in ginataang gulay (e. g. langka, kalabasa), adobo sa gata, hipon sa gata, pinangat (that spicy Bicol dish with gabi and hot peppers), suman, etc. Macapuno, that deviant nut, is of course candied, cooked in syrup, mixed into halo-halo or sherbet. At \"d. eath\" — for taking its heart means killing the tree — the coconut yields ubud for lumpia. or salad, or what the Visayans call ensalada: a cooling drink of buko water, kalamansi juice, crufichy bits of ubud, and fruit, the traditional partner to lumpiang ubud. The coconut's availability and versatility have helped shape many Filipino tastes and dishes.

The Greenery The landscape also of fers the vines, shrubs, fields, for ests and trees, from which comes the galaxy of gulay with which we are blest all year round. \"Back home,\" an American friend commented, \"all we use from day to day are peas, carrots, potatoes, lettuce, cabbage and very few others.\" The dietarily uninhibited Filipino, on the other hand, recognizes the succulence of roots {gabi, ube, kamote); the delicacy and flavor of leaves (pechay, dahong bawang, kinchay, pako, malunggay ) and tendrils (talbos ng ampalaya, kalabasa, sayote); the bounty of fruits (not only upo and kalabasa, talong and ampalaya, but even dessert fruits Jike nangka and banana, which double as vegetables); and the excitement of flowers like katuray and kalabasa. A lowly weed like kulitis or saluyot, or a swamp growth like kangkong, comes into use, its flavor evoked by steaming, boiling, salting, combining. Nor is any part wasted. Kangkong leaves and young stalks, for example, go into sinigang, but the to ugher stalks are made by Visayans into apan-apan, literally \"mock locust.\" * * The same imagination is applied to the souring in gredients used in sinigang. The cook who sours with kalamansi or vinegar suffers, in the folk view, from \"abysmal poverty of mind,\" for these are to be used only in extreme necessity, being too obvious. Instead, one uses mashed sampalok or kamias; guavas or green pineapple; alibangbang leaves or the tenderly gredn sampaloc leaves and flowers; batuan or to matoes; or * combinations of these and other sour fruits that different regions know and prefer. This bounty becomes habit, then taste. 6 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Land and the Man The Filipino's appreciation for the bounty of sea and land quite clearly grows out of his peasant closeness to the land. The farmer, the fisherman, the carabao tender, each is from birth at tuned to the season and to the weather, knowing when ulang abound in the rivers; when it is right to plant kamote or to go out with lamp and fishnet; where wild pako (fern) are likely to be found; which bananas are good to boil, which to eat from the bunch. Perhaps it is this same folk Wisdom that made him salt fish and alamang into t Uyo, daing and bagoong for these, aside from preserving the fish and making rice go a long way, also help retain body fluid, an important consideration in our hot weather. The meagerness of his means makes him in ventive, able to make a meal of kamote tops from his backyard; to put to gether a small fish, a few tendrils and to matoes to make sinigang. It also makes him im¬ provise easily. No strict for mulae for him (ever hear of a recipe, or of measuring in gredients for sinigang?) since one cooked what or how much was available. The simplicity of these meals makes the Filipino sensitive to flavors — the bitter, the succulent, the aromatic, the sour — unmasked by sauce or spice. The stark quality of his lifestyle makes him waste nothing, not the gabi stalk (it is stripped into strings to tie the leaf- jundles in pinangat) or the coconut husk, or the fishhead. This, too, taught him to salt or smoke fish to keep; to dry food in the sun; to make paksiw and sinigang which keep with out refrigeration. This then, I would say, is the native cuisine: one born out of the land and the landscape, the weather and the seasons, as well as out of the means and lifestyles of people in an agricultural society. Foreign Influences But of course, as in all aspects of culture, for eign in fluences come to bear. and create changes. The two major in fluences on Filipino cuisine would be the Chinese and the Spanish. To the Chinese we owe the \"noodle explosion\": all the pancit using miki, bihon, sotanghon, etc., and combinations, and which were in digenized and varied by the regions in which they developed. Thus the fishing town of Malabon developed pancit Malabon, with its oysters and seafood; modest Lucban developed pancit habhab, \"poor town's fare\" of miki, cooked in the marketplace and eaten off squares of banana leaf; while other regions use chicharron, tinapa, pork, shrimp, Chinese sausages, even chorizo de Bilbao"

From here too developed the yancit na may sabaw, noodles in broth like lomi and mami, with pork, shrimp, meatballs, to asted gar¬ lic, etc. To the Chinese, too, we owe staples of contemporary Filipino Why Sinigang? 7 meriendas, such as lumpia, kekiam, siopao and siomai. The legacy from Spanish cuisine is quite different from the above, and from the native, since its chief characteristic is richness. From the Spaniards we learned the guisado, with oil and to mato sauce; our rich stews like cocido and puchero which would have been way beyond the native lifestyle, with their reckless combination of pork, chicken, beef, vegetables, chorizos, jamon China, morcilla. Also Spanish are the different rice-meat dishes that are derivations of paella (arroz a la Valenciana, bringhe); the galantinas and rellenos fan Ermita friend recalls that their relleno was fat capon stuffed with foie gras, truffles, ground pork, olives, pork sausages and chorizos); and the rich desserts that require such time, labor, and money to make — brazos, to rtas im¬ perials, Castillos, borrachos, suspiros. While the Chinese food that was absorbed into our cuisine was, on the whole, relatively in expensive, and the refore found its way into lower and middle class cuisine, quite obviously the Spanish in fluence was principally on the ilustrado, the elite, and the refore evolved into fiesta fare. American food came in \\Vith colonization, through the educa¬ tion al system, the media, the magazines, the movies, and as part of the American lifestyle so eagerly absorbed. Convenieryze was its chief legacy — sandwiches and salads, pressure cookers and freezers, pre¬ cooking and in stant cooking, supermarkets and fastfood. All for eign in fluences were not adopted outright, but adapted, adjusted to the native taste and lifestyle, just as they were transformed in other areas of the culture — in clothing, literature, drama, music and art. Filipino tastes in food, the refore, were shaped by the landscape — the land and the water and the life they bear; by rice as staple and accompaniment; by the versatility of the coconut; by in fluences from for eign cuisines, especially those of the Chinese traders, and the Spanish and American colonizers. Filipino cuisine is an authentic facet of Philippine culture that in vites methodical in quiry. On our tables, rich or poor, are mute — albeit aromatic — testimony to the blending of history and our landscape. These dishes, especially the humbler ones, show the Filipino's understanding of the potential of his surroundings, his ima¬ ginative exploration into nature, his in stinctive sensitivity to nuances of combination, contrast and accompaniment. His lifestyle is limned by the simplicity and flexibility of his dishes, there being no hard-and- fast, in violable combinations or proportions, but a knowledgeable making-do, an ease of improvisation also seen in his drama and dance. Why sinigang? Why all the other things? The full exploration of the shaping of a people's taste is a rewarding and pleasurable voyage to wards the definition of identity.

Not trees or presents or weather does he recall, but the food that he can almost sense in the remembering: chocolate thick and frothy in a small white cup, bibingka golden on a singed banana leaf, eaten with’ moist white grated coconut that makes a little juice on the to ngue. Ask about his hometown, and a Filipino will remember a spinster aunt who made pastillas de pili; tulingan bought fresh off fishing boats on the seashore; armfuls of dampalit gathered in fishponds for pickling; ulang speared with home-made guns in shallow waters; or green mangoes snitched off the neighbor's trees. Even after much travel and acculturation, even after tastebuds at tuned to wine and caviar and French sauces, the Filipino will speak longingly of silver-grey shrimps leaping in a basket, of bangus stuffed with to matoes and on ions and thrown on a fire till black and crusty, of sawsazvan and pamutat and kamayan. Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin, the French lawyer (1755-1826) renowned as the philosopher of cuisine, said it all very succinctly in his fourth aphorism — one of the 20 that serve as preambled his book The Physiology of Taste: \"Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.\"2 An exploration of what the Filipino eats — the sources of his food, the way it is prepared and served — should the refore surely reveal something of his view of the world, of nature, and of his fellow- men. Filipino Food and the Natural Environment The Filipino's in digenous cuisine, his native food before coloni¬ zation by Spain and the United States, reveals an in timate knowledge of his environment. It is a cuisine drawn directly from nature — from the biyaya ng lupa — from nature thoroughly explored and imagi¬ natively used. £ Let us look first at the foods he has chosen to cull from nature. Because of the anatomy of his country -— islands in a tropical clime, surrounded by fertile waters. Where fields and for ests are close at hand, he has two principal sources of food: the waters — the sea, rivers, brooks, estuaries, even rice paddies — and the fields and for ests, both of which yield a bounty of plant and animal life. Since our ancestors typically settled near water sources, along rivers, on coastal lands, the waters constitute perhaps the most immediate source of food, which is why most everyday Filipino dishes revolve around fish and seafood. We do not spurn any of the bounty of the waters; from the shark (which becomes kinunot na pating) to the barely visible pinhead-sized tabios; from the lobster to the alamang; from the capiz to the lowly tulya; and crabs of all varieties — from the tiny talangka, hundreds of which are immolated to produce the or ange Food and the Philippine Worldview 11 taba that we prodigally pour on hot rice, to the igud or coconut robber crab which, because of its diet, carries within it the makings of its own sauce. We eat the heads of fishes, savoring the eyes, the maws, the brains; we suck out the fat in the heads of shrimps; we salt and pickle fish roe; we know how to savor the goodness of watery creatures in all their stages of growth, from tiny fry to giant breeder (for example, the sabalo, or mother bangus). The plant life around us provides us with our next most bountiful source of food. From the vines, shrubs, plants, grasses, and trees come the bevy of vegetables which are enjoyed all year round. We revel in a seemingly endless variety of roots (gabi, ube, kamote, singkamas), delicate leaves (dahong bawang, malunggay, alugbate, pechay, pako, etc.), tendrils (talbos ng ampalaya, kalabasa, sayote), fruits (jackfruit and banana are vegetables as well as fruits), seeds (beans, jackfruit seeds) and even flowers (katuray, squash). Lacking any dietary in hibi¬ tions, we find provender in swamps, sea growth (sea weeds, for exam¬ ple), rice or cane fields or even on sidewalks. We make use of what some might call weeds (kulitis, saluyot, talinum), of stalks and shoots, of pulp, peel and seed"

In field and for est, too, we have found all the shades, degrees and varieties of tartness to add piquancy to our sinigang. \"Souring\" with something obvious like kalamansi or to matoes is, to the native mind, to be done only in dire emergencies, and souring with a packaged mix, only when one is out of the country, and desperate for sinigang. This is because there are so many delightfully different souring elements around: sampalok fruits or young leaves, kamias, guavas, green pine¬ apples, alibangbang leaves, batuan, green mangoes, or combinations of these. The native to ngue has tried and experienced their subtle differ¬ ences, and their effects on the sour broths that are so refreshing in hot weather. &f In this plant environment, too, are available the spices, herbs and flavorings that were not what Magellan was looking for, but which we know how to use with our native fare: the tanglad or lemon grass which Visayans stuff into lechon; the star-shaped anise or sangke which gives aroma to certain puto; the kasubha which is related to saffron and gilds our arroz caldo; dilaw or turmeric and langkawas which look like ginger but differ from it in aroma and purpose; and all the chilis and peppers that render food hot and exciting. From the plant life in the environment, too, come two gifts of cardinal importance to the Filipino: rice and coconut. The coconut is more than food, for from its leaves come palaspas for Palm Sundays, hats and balls for picnics, walls and roofs for sheds and entablado, while the stripped midrib makes walis tingting and matchstick curtains. The husks scrub our floors; the trunks bridge our creeks; the shells are scoops, molds, ladles. By way of food, we make use of the 12 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food coconut from birth to maturity. The sap of the bud ferments into tuba; the cooling water and the tender, translucent flesh of the young coconut are not only enjoyed fresh but cooked with shrimps or chicken or pork; the mature white meat we grate to go with kakanin, or squeeze for gata. The \"freak\" macapuno is a staple of the national sweet to oth; and we demand the death of the tree in or der to have the fresh heart, the ' ubud, for our lumpiang ubud. Rice is even more important, for it is more than basic cereal. It is the background against which all our food is meant to be eaten, and thus shapes our tastes and, in no small part, our cuisine. Why do we sour (sinigang and paksiw) or salt heavily (tuyo, daing, bagoong), pepper or flavor strongly? Because the blandness, the humility of rice calls for the accent of strong flavors — something bread does not demand. This is why the Filipino on a diet always moans: But what is Filipino food with out rice? One can easily eat steak and fried chicken with out bread, but how can kari-kari and binagoongang baboy be enjoyed with out rice? Rice can, further, be ground into flour, and thus made into the kaleidoscope of rice cakes and sweets, puto of all shapes, colors and flavors, found all over the Philippines, from the Muslim south to the north. The significance of rice is seen when we discover that just about all our feasts (weddings, burials, victory rituals in in digenous societies, Christmas in Christianized regions) are associated with a rice special¬ ty. Ask the expatriate, the cosmopolite, the provincial, and all will remember some form of rice cake marking the misa de gallo, or the media noche, or Christmas Day itself; the puto bumbong served with free salabat in the early morning; in Vigan the tinubong cooking in bamboo tubes while all knelt at midnight Mass. Rice, the refore, is celebrative fare as well as the humble, daily, year-round staple. Its water from washing provides broth for sinigang; its young grains pounded flat make pinipig. It can be fermented into wine, or into the relish called buro. Even the tutong at the bottom of a cooking pot is eaten, not from hunger or thrift, but with pleasure and as another taste experience. In Quezon to wns, on the feast of San Isidro Labrador, rice also becomes the colorful wafer called kiping which, shaped into sunbursts, chandeliers and whirls, decorates houses and is also fried and eaten"

In the waters, fields and for ests flourishes the living animal world. Pigafetta [1524] recorded that Magellan and his party were served pork by their native hosts. We do not know if that came from a domesticated pig or a wild one since the Filipino, even now, does not hesitate to seek food beyond his backyard. He does not restrict himself to the animals he raises, but tries wild boar, mountain chicken, deer; the dog and the carabao; even his fighting cock when it loses its fight (a special Batangas dish is called talunang manok), and other foods that the Westerner considers either exotic or disgusting: snake, iguana. Food and the Philippine Worldview 13 field rat, unhatched duckling in balut, locust, fruit bat, kamaru or mole cricket, civet cat, baby octopus, ant eggs, woodworm or tamilok — almost anything that flies of swims. Why not? All belong to the bounty of sea and land — biyaya ng lupa. What cooking methods did the Filipino develop for this varied feast gathered from his surroundings? The very simplest and wisest. Because of the proximity, this water, plant and animal life is avail¬ able in all its freshness. So what would be the best way to cook what is not helado, frozen, or plastic-wrapped, for dalag swimming till purchased, shrimp jumping from the tumpok, and crabs crawling out of 'the kaserola? The best way is to do as little as possible. Do not mar its pristine quality; do not drown it in heavy sauces and spices (which were of ten used in Europe to disguise food some steps away from freshness). Eat it raw, as oysters from unpolluted waters should be eaten; or merely marinated in good, strong native vinegar, as in kilawing dilis or tanguingue; or lightly steamed, as in halabos na hipon; or roasted on coals. The special maliputo of Taal may be cooked in but ter or served * with lemon, but it is best coalroasted and eaten with bagoong Balayan and kalamansi. Or cooked in a little vinegar and garlic as paksiw, which is good hot or cold, and is an excellent way of preserving food where there are no refrigerators. Or cooked in a sour broth as sinigang. Or just lightly boiled as tinola or pesa. The rich, greasy, cholesterol-high methods of cooking are alien to our understanding of what is proper for the freshness which nature bestows on us. Because freshness is immediately available, we demand it as a birthright. This, plus the fact that rice is a basic dietary staple and \"background taste,\" has shaped our in digenous cuisine. The elements of Philippine cooking are thus drawn from the landscape, and this explains why it bears such strong resemblances to the other cuisines of Southeast Asia — those of Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. The land, the clime are similar; the refore so is the food. This is the Malay matrix of Philippine food; this is in digenous and native. Native Philippine cuisine is thus clearly a result of the Filipino's peasant closeness to the land and to nature. Not only has he explored its nooks and crannies, cycles and seasons, sea, plant and animal life, but, in his work as farmer, fisherman, carabao tender and gatherer of for est products, he is from birth at tuned to season and weather.

Native cuisine, born out of the land, the weather and the seasons, the means and lifestyle of people in an agricultural society, reflects a ' relationship with nature that is in timate, adventurous, pragmatic and eminently wise — as the modern dietitian and gourmet have since discovered. The Filipino and his Fellow Man: The Language of Food Many aspects in his cuisine which in dicate the Filipino's rela¬ tion ship to his fellow man are worth studying separately, but we can here focus on two rather disparate ones: the sawsawan, and what Carmen E. Santiago has called \"the language of food.\"4 When one partakes of a meal cooked by a French chef, and asks for, horrors, A-l sauce, one is guilty of a great, unpardonable in sult. The French chef or dains how a dish should taste, and one is not supposed to add even a grain of salt or a pinch of pepper — much less a glob of catsup! That would be tantamount to adding dabs of paint to a signed painting. Not so the Filipino chef. He does not prescribe how a dish should taste. Although he knows the precise degree of sourness proper to a sinigang, or of anghang proper to his pinangat, he fully expects his cooking to be embellished and enhanced, adjusted and adapted to in dividual tastes by means of the sawsawan or dipping sauce. In other words, he is professing no superiority; the consumer has a part in the creation of the dish just as he has. Our simple cooking methods — boiling, steaming, roasting and sour-stewing — do have flavors built in, but they are simple and basic, and in vite \"consumer participation.\" So squeeze kalamansi on your food; sprinkle it with patis; dip it in vinegar sprinkled with crushed garlic, black pepper or in cendiary chilis; accompany it with a side dish of bagoong sauteed with bits of pork and sprinkled with wansoy; or enhance it with bean paste sauteed with on ion and to matoes. Surround yourself, if you so please, with a galaxy of little saucers containing different flavor-teasing combina¬ tions. Make each bite a different experience, if you wish. Tease your to ngue, tickle your palate, plunder your imagination. Invent, combine, experiment. Aside from the basics like toyo, suka, patis and kalamansi, Filipinos have added to the dipping lexicon such condiments as crunchy slices of kamias, young mango shoots, little sour green paho, coriander Food and the Philippine Worldview 15. leaf or wansoy, Chinese celery or kinchay, fermented rice and shrimp, fish roe, salted eggs, pork crackling, and on ions and to matoes. What does it all mean? That the chef and the eater, the creator and the consumer, are on equal footing; that eating is an act of creation in which both participate, an experience in which both are creators and critics. No Filipino cook would, like the chef Vatel, commit suicide because the fish or dered for a banquet had not been delivered. He would probably have made do with whatever was available — galunggong, ayungin — and let his audience share in the adjustment he had to make. Our use of the sawsawan, the refore, betrays a laissez faire, non- prescriptive relationship between man (cook) and man (cooked for). It makes food preparation communal and participatory. It is a relaxed, sharing relationship, one of a piece with the Filipino's relationship with surrounding nature. The language of food is properly the study of psychologists and psycholinguists.

And it is a proper gift for those way beyond one's social world, like visiting royalty or the local equivalent. It is right when the relationship is casual, and when it is in timate; when it is one of supplication or of gratitude; when it is noncommittal, and when it is committed. It curries favor, stores up goodwill, expresses friendship and represents utang na loob — yet can never be called a bribe. » Food then is obviously a versatile \"counter in the exchange of goodwill,\" a coin of different values that can be graded up and down and is never nakakahiya (in appropriate) to give or to accept — an authentic language, the nuances of which are well understood by both the giver and the receiver. Yet another facet of its function as a language is seen in its sharing. When one is eating something, be it a sandwich or a feast, one is expected to in vite whoever is around to share it — a bite, a sip, a lick must be of fered even when patently impossible to accept. The obliga¬ tion becomes stronger in one's hom£. Anyone who comes in (except per¬ haps a bill collector), at mealtime or otherwise, should be fed some¬ thing or in vited to join a meal in progress. The soft drink or cracker is a 16 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food word of welcome: even more symbolic is the way the guest is urged to sit and join the meal in progress. If one's presence, expected or not, occasions a fuss — special dishes that take time to prepare, served in guest china and silver kept in the cupboard for the purpose — then one is of the \"bisita or ibang tao category,\" as noted by Carmen Santiago.5 The dishes served to such a guest are not usually those of the native cuisine (not paksiw or tuyo) but adapted from that of the colonizers — in digenized Spanish dishes like relleno and pochero, or in digenized American fare like fried chicken and salad. If, however, one's presence, expected or not, does not occasion a fuss, but in volves the use of the daily — possibly chipped, perhaps plastic — tableware and the customary fare (pritong galunggong and ginisang ampalaya), then one is Hindi ibang tao (not a stranger; one of us) and can share sawsawan and whatever food there is with the family. The deepest level of being Hindi ibang tao, the level of complete acceptance, is evident when one can walk into the kitchen to help on eself to a glass of water, or help bring out the food: Hindi ka naman bisita (\"You are now one of us, no longer a guest\"). A priest narrates how reconciliation in a long and bitter family feud in the Ilocos was negotiated in this language. A member of one side went to the house of a member of the other side and asked for a drink of water. He was casually told, \"Help yourself; you know where it is.\" When he went in, dipped into the jar of drinking water and drank from the communal dipper, the feud was over. His asking for water was the first move, a plea for for giveness. The in vitation to help himself as one of the family, not a stranger, was the granting of for giveness, the expression of a wish to return to the old footing. The drinking of the water sealed the reconciliation. Had he been served the water like a stranger, or told that the drinking jar was empty, the refusal would have been just as clear.

The Filipino and the World • The for egoing discussion on what Filipino cuisine reveals about the Filipino's relationship to nature and to his fellow man cannot but in dicate his worldview: his in timacy with nature, his understanding of it as source of life, his imaginative exploration of its resources, his uniquely Filipino methods of handling (cooking) these resources, and his ways of using food as coin in social, economic and political tran¬ sactions. Further in sight can be achieved by an examination of how the Filipino handles change in his cuisine, specifically the in fluence of for eign cooking. Certainly the two major in fluences on Filipino cuisine come from the Chinese and the Spanish. What was absorbed and how, from either for eign cuisine, makes a revealing study. To Chinese cuisine we owe just about all our noodles: miki, bihon, sotanghon, pancit Canton — noodles 'transparent, opaque, fat, thin. So thoroughly and well have we absorbed the noodle that almost no region is with out a pancit of its own, varied *and in digenized according to locale. Thus Marilao, in rice country, has pancit sprinkled with crumbled rice okoy; while others sprinkle flaked tinapa or ground chicharron; and others top with sauces or saute with sausages. From the Chinese too, we learned to cook noodles with broth (Zomf, mami), wrap vegetables in thin rice crepes (lumpia), encase meat in dough or leaf lard {siomai, siopao, kekiam). These are the Chinese dishes that have been most widely absorbed into our cuisine, and are now cooked in homes, in small corner merenderos, in school cafeterias, and in restau¬ rants up and down the scale. The legacy from Spanish cuisine is quite different, since its basic in gredients and processes are from a different material and ethnic world — cooking in olive oil, for example. In the desire of a colonized people to imitate the ways and the urbanity of the colonizer, Spanish food became the gauge of Hispanization. Thus the elite families, the principalia, whose means and education brought them this Hispani¬ zation more easily, soon came to have on their tables stews like cocido and puchero, stuffed fowl like galantina, pavo embuchado, relleno and the other dishes that still bear their Spanish names — lengua estofada, morcon, embutido, callos — in cluding the elaborate desserts (brazos de la reina, turron de almendras, to cino del cielo) that are the preserve of women with much leisure (like the legions of old-maid aunts who bless our lives with their cooking and their devotion).

However, as with everything else he has adppted, the Filipino changed, adapted, in digenized. The Chinese lumpia is now unmis¬ takably Filipino, dipped in vinegar and garlic, covered with a sweet¬ ish, garlicky sauce, or sprinkled with powdered peanuts. The Spanish paella has, on the one hand, assumed a dignity it does not have in Spain by being made impossibly rich and expensive, and on the other hand evolved into a native dish using sticky rice and coconut milk. American fried chicken is marinated in soy sauce and kalamansi, or vinegar and garlic before frying in stead of being shaken in seasoned flour. Pies are filled with buko, salads with kaong, pizza seasoned to the native to ngue. And although the Filipino will always feel that the best bibingka is made from handground galapong and cooked on a banana leaf with coals above and below it, he adjusts to convenience and schedules by using baking powder, mixes and new ovens he in vents. He may even, in an emergency, use ube or salabat powder from a packet, frozen shrimp, and the pressure cooker in stead of long, slow simmering. The adaptation is evident, and necessary, but the core of the Filipino's thinking about food is a loyalty to what nature provided, to the way it was in tended to be understood and used — because that is the right way. Being in harmony with nature is not just habit and tradition; it is rightness. In his food, the refore, the Filipino in dicates his at titude to the world outside. Its in trusions and in fluences are welcome, provided they are adapted and in digenized, and thus eased into the prevailing harmony. This harmony is fundamental to the Filipino's worldview, and seen in his relations with the world, with nature and its cycles, and with his fellow men. Historically, in the agricultural community which determined many values still dominant to day, harmony with one's fellow men was necessary because of mutual need. In a lifestyle with but few resources, the mutual help between neighbors was a large part of a man's wealth. Food functions to keep this harmony operative. The cook and the cooked-for share in its preparation, making food communal both around the table, and between kitchen and table. Food acts as a social lubricant in all kinds of relationships, an in finitely flexible communicator. It is in direct but eloquent; with it no one loses face, and even after refusals neighbors can go on to coexist and cooperate in other ways. Food is better than language because it hardly ever Food and the Philippine Worldview 19 of fends, yet its meaning is unmistakable. It is the kind of nonverbal communication the Filipino prefers; it is nonconfrontative, causes no pain and disrupts no harmonies. Today the young Filipino's food preference is of course changing, with the in flux of global culture, and since modem life is leading him farther and farther away from the tradition bred in an agricultural society. It is not only that few housewives have the time to search for alibangbang and green pineapple with which to sour sinigang na baboy, or raise and fatten chickens for the Christmas tinola. Even more notable than the supermarket-to-freezer convenience is the new taste for fast food prepackaged, preflavored and precooked, and especially for the beguiling products of the transnational food cprporation. The young, enticed by hamburgers and pan pizza, will soon look back on provincial cooking with little nostalgia, and no sense of loss. Their children to come may well be completely ignorant of subtleties of sourness and sweetness, their tastes homogenized by global standards. When the preferences in the choice and preparation of food change, it will be an in dication that the social bases are changing too — those which in timate the relationship to nature, to one's fellow men, and to the world. The legacy the agricultural community left in the matrices of Filipino art, drama, literature, food, values and world¬ view, still find expression among most Filipinos, even those raised in urban centers.

Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine food NYONE seeking to explore Filipino food before or early in the era of Spanish colonization probably starts by discovering the death of source material. Records of the period before Western contact are virtually nonexistent, for three reasons. First, if there were any, they were probably in scribed on bamboo, bark, or leaf, and no longer exist. Second, three centuries and a half stand between them and the present researcher, a hiatus which has created not only a data void, but a psychological distance. And third, friar and government accounts, which constitute the bulk of extant records, say little about food. The Spanish friar, the representative of Spain closest to the people's or dinary life, was no anthropologist, and in general was 22 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food in terested mainly in those details of Indio life which had relevance to his task of Christianization. He considered many of the native lifeways pagan and primitive, un-Spanish and un-Christian, and the refore necessary to replace with Christian equivalents. Even more importantly, the burden of his teaching — of religion, of language, of Hispanic customs — created the at titudinal set known as the \"colonial ment ality,\" which made the native Filipino look down on traditional lifestyles and aspire for Hispanic replacements. Thus eventually the Filipino himself was partly responsible for leaving no records, because he came to see his culture as in ferior, and deserving of change. This is why there are few of the usual historical materials relating to Philippine food — no cookbooks ethnic or otherwise, no books on household matters, no market lists, no in for mation on con¬ servation and preservation, no menus till the nineteenth century, and they are mainly of Spanish and Chinese food, the native food not being served in restaurants, only at home, where it went largely unrecorded. The researcher must obviously delve into nonfood records in or der to sift out the occasional ment ion of the food the Filipino natives were eating at the time. These ethnographic materials consist principally of reports sent to Spain by friars, government of ficials and travellers — memorias, or memoranda to the King, his of ficials, or to heads of the five religious or ders working in the Philippines (Augustinians, Domi¬ nicans, Recollects, Franciscans and Jesuits); relaciones or relations of events in the Philippines, generally within a time frame (e. g. \"Rela¬ tion of Events in the Filipinas Islands from 1618 to 1619\"); cronicas, or histories of missionary work in the islands; carlas, or letters to gov¬ ernment or religious authorities, such as the yearly letters (litterae annuae ) of Jesuits to their superiors in Spain; and other similar mate¬ rials.

Primo viaggio in to rno al mondo 1 was written ca. 1525 and starts with Pigafetta hearing in Barcelona that an expedition under Ferdinand Magellan was setting out. They set sail from Seville on August 10, 1519. The fleet of five small vessels had been reduced to three by March 16, 1521, when the first of the Philippine islands (called by them the archipelago of St. Lazarus) was sighted. The very first ment ion of Philippine food in a European account records the moment when the Spanish expedition first to uched land, and the men saw their first natives — nine men in a boat, to whom they served food and gave \"red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory.\" The na¬ tives reciprocated by presenting fish, a jar of palm wine, \"figs more than one palmo long\" (i. e., bananas), and others smaller and more deli¬ cate, and two coconuts. Pigafetta explains what those wondrous fruits Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine Food 23 are:... [Coconuts] are the fruit borne by the palm trees. And just as we have bread, wine, oil and vinegar in their several kinds, these people have the aforesaid things which come only from the palm trees. And know that wine is obtained from the said palm trees in the following manner. They make an aperture into the heart of the tree at its top which is called palmito, from which is distilled along the tree a liquor like white must, which is sweet with a to uch of greenness. Then they take canes as thick as a man's leg, by which they draw off this liquor, fastening them to the tree from the evening until next morning, and from the morning to the evening, so that the said liquor comes little by little. This palm tree bears a fruit, named cocho [coco, coconut], which is as large as the head or the reabouts, and its first husk is green and two fingers thick, in which are found certain fibers of which those people make the ropes by which they bind their boats. Under this husk is another, very hard and thicker than that of a nut. This second husk they burn and make of it a powder that is useful to them. And under the said husk there is a white marrow of a finger's thickness which they eat fresh with meat. and fish, as we do bread, and it has the flavour of an almond, and if it were dried it would make bread. From the center of this marrow there flows a water which is clear and sweet and very refreshing, and when it stands and settles it congeals and becomes like an apple. And when they wish to make oil they take this fruit called cocho and put it in the sun and let the said marrow putrefy and ferment in the water, then they boil it and it becomes oil like but ter. When they wish to make vinegar, they let the water of the said cocho ferment and put it in the sun, which turns it into vinegar like white wine. From the said fruit milk can also « be made, as we proved by experience. For we scraped that marrow, then mixed it with its own water, and being passed through a cloth it. became like goat's milk. This kind of palm tree is like the palm that bears dates, but not so knotty. And two of these trees will sustain a family of ten persons. But they do not draw the aforesaid wine always from one tree, but take it for a week from one, and so with the other, for otherwise the trees would dry up. And in this way they last one hundred years.2 Aside front*this rare and strange food, the natives later brought sweet or anges, a jar of palm-wine, and a cock \"in or der to show us that there were fowls in that district.\" During their stay on that island Magellan went ashore daily to visit the sick, and \"every morning gave them coconut water from his own hand, which comforted them greatly.\" The next encounter was with a native king, who reciprocated the presents given him with a basketful of ginger and a large bar of gold. 24 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food which the captain did not accept.

The wine that was left \"in the cup\" at any time, although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by itself. The king's cup was always kept covered and no one else drank from it but he and I. Before the king took the cup to drink, he raised his clasped hands to ward the sky, and then to ward me; and when he was about to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand to ward me (at first I thought he was going to strike me) and then drank. I did the same to ward the king. They all make those signs one to ward another when they drink. We ate with such ceremonies and with other signs of friendship.3 Those were just appetizers, because later the supper hour was announced, and \"Two large porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice and the other of pork with its gravy... After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was brought in, and ginger freshly gathered, * and wine... Then two platters were brought in (one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice)...\" All the dishes of that king, Piga¬ fetta writes, were of gold. \"There... [were] dogs, cats, swine, fowls, goats, rice, ginger, coconuts, fig [bananas], or anges, lemons, millet, panicum, sorgo, wax, and a quantity of gold\" in that island. Magellan and his men also saw \"bats as large as eagles\" and in need killed and ate one of them. Pigafetta says it \"resembled chicken in taste.\" In the same island, Gatigan, they also noticed black birds as large as domestic chickens, with long tails; these laid eggs as large as goose eggs and buried them in the sand, to hatch in the heat. \"Those eggs are good to eat,\" he writes.4 » After the explorers moved on to Cebu, there was more sharing of porcelain platters of meat and jars of wine, and then a meeting with the king, whom they found sitting in his palace, on a mat on the ground, eating turtle eggs from two porcelain dishes, and drinking from four jars of \"palm wine covered with sweet-smelling herbs and arranged wit& four small reeds in each jar by means of which he drank.\" They were then entertained wfth dances \"by three quite naked girls.\"5 Pigafetta, who seems more in terested in details df food and lifestyle than almost any Spaniard who came later, also notes that the people ate large sea snails called laghan, which are \"beautiful to the sight\" and kill whales. \"For the whale swallows them alive, and when they are in the whale's body, they come out of their shells and eat the whale's heart. These people afterward find them alive near the dead whale's heart. Those creatures have black teeth and skin and a white shell, and the flesh is good to eat.\"6 Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine Food 25 He further records what he calls a \"ceremony used to consecrate swine,\" which we on hindsight realize was probably a ritual, surely of welcome, that in volved the sacrifice of a black pig, still the favored sacrifice in babaylan (native high priest) rituals even to this day. This first account of native Philippine rituals shows what ceremonial food was among those Filipinos: \"three large dishes... two with roses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped in leaves, and roast fish,\" cups of wine. After the ceremony, the food was eaten by the priestesses and the worpen.7 Filipino hospitality, it seems, was the same then as it is now: \"Whenever any of our men went ashore,\" writes Pigafetta,\" \"both by day and by night, every one in vited him to eat and to drink. Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink frequently and copiously from the jars through those small reeds, and one of their meals lasts for five or six hours.\"8 Much can be learned from Pigafetta, especially in the light of surviving customs among Filipinos to day. Food still has a very important ceremonial aspect, even if sacrifice is not much practised in urban areas (although it survives), and rituals have changed. Food is still the first element of ceremonies, of the welcoming of guests, of gestures of friendship. The basic food is still fish and soqae meat, of ten flavored with ginger and other aromatic roots. The food is found by non- Filipinos to be \"very salty,\" perhaps too salty, because it is meant to be eaten with an accompaniment of rice, which is a balancing, bland background for saltiness"

The food is found by non- Filipinos to be \"very salty,\" perhaps too salty, because it is meant to be eaten with an accompaniment of rice, which is a balancing, bland background for saltiness. The food is in general freshly gathered from the environment — it does not travel a long distance — and thus prepared with very little cooking (half-cooked, Pigafetta thought), the natural thing to do with fish fresh out of the waters, the flesh of animals from the hunt or the backyard, and greens from nearby fields and for ests. What seem like exotica to the for eigner — whale-killing snails, unfamiliar fowl, turtle eggs — are simply the products of an environment familiar, abundant and well-explored. Would that other for eign visitors who followed Pigafetta had been as observant, as careful about documentation, as curious about details. Unfortunately, most of the other chroniclers were more in terested in other aspects of life. Loarca, Lavezaris, et al. Miguel de Loarca, in his \"Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas\" (1582), limits himself to observing that all the natives \"are provided with fowls, swine, a few goats, beans, and a kind of root resembling the potatoes of Sancto Domingo, called by the natives camotes \" (the Mexican name for sweet potato, widely used in the Philippines). He adds that \"after rice, fish is the main article of maintenance in this and other islands, for it abounds in all of them, and is of excellent quality in this island of Cebu.\" Deer, he said, are available on other islands but not in Cebu.9 26 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Guido de Lavezaris, et al., replying to Fray Martin de Rada in 1574, say it is untrue that the natives have very little food, and \"live on roots part of the year... potatoes, sago bread, and other vege¬ tables,\" for \"they eat all sorts of food\" like borona, millet, beans, fish, swine, fowl, many kinds of wine. These \"great quantities of provisions\" they get from irrigated lands.10 Loarca, Lavezaris and company register some surprise at the variety and quantity of food the \"pagan natives\" produced, or gathered from the surrounding fields, for ests and waters. They also register some disdain for the \"roots\" eaten, which must have seemed to them in ferior or hardship food. It remained for another chronicler some centuries later, the Jesuit Juan L. Delgado, to record the great variety of root crops that the Filipinos had discovered to be edible and useful and — even now — good eating. Most of the stray sentences — a line or two — in other similar accounts simply confirm the above basic in for mation about the native diet. We note that little is said about the native cuisine, the cooking processes, or the names of dishes. Rice: Food, Coin, Symbol. Much of the in for mation focuses on rice, which is obviously the central, staple food — highly valued, highly symbolical. It was not only used in ceremonies like weddings (in some of which the couple exchanged balls of rice) and welcome rites, but was the matter of tribute (two fanegas of unwinnowed rice a year 11), and the medium of support demanded of the natives for the religious — payment, one might say, for the grace of Christianization: When vouchers are issued for the stipends and the support of the religious ministers, the reckoning is by fanegas, at the rate of two cabans of twenty-four gantas each, of the said palay rice un¬ cleaned. And because his Majesty chooses that they give it to us very clean, it is now ruled in the royal accountancy that the forty- eight gantas of the fanega of palay is equivalent to a basket of twenty gantas of bigas, which is the name for cleaned rice. Hence the king in his charity, in or der to give us our sustenance in the rice with out waste, gives valuation to the measure at his own pleasure, for the rice with husk, so that the quantity may be doubled. The estimation of the king on this is not the same as looking into the hollow measure in its strict capacity, as has been already explained.12 Rice was thus not only a medium of exchange, but \"coin of the realm\" and of colonization — more than tribute, since it was not only to ken of subservience but also direct, immediate support"

The on erous¬ ness of colonization is clea Yly and symbolically seen in the fact that in the conversion from palay of husked rice, the natives, who constituted the for ces of production, were taken advantage of through the valua¬ tion favoring the friars and given by the king. Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine Food 27 Rice was even used to express grief, the Spaniards found: \"As a sign of mourning, they ate no cleaned rice for a whole year, but only herbs and vegetables,\"13 — proof not only of the ceremonial use of rice, but of its centrality to Philippine life. As other mourners give up colored clothing, or social activity, the Filipino gave up rice. How was the rice cooked? One friar, in terested in \"native races and their customs,\" notes that it was well hulled and cleaned, and boiled only with water. Cooked, it was called \"morisqueta\" by the Spaniards, \"as if to call it 'food of the Moors'\" — pagan food, implied¬ ly in ferior. The rice was flavored with the broth of small fishes \"lacking in no part,\" boiled in water. At banquets, however, they added \"vension, pork or beef, which they like best when it has begun to spoil, and to smell bad\" — probably the dried meat we call tapa, or forms of fermented food (fermentation being one way of preservation), such as buro. He too noted a predilection for salty and acid foods — used to flavor rice, as we have already noted, as well as to preserve food. It is Father San Antonio, a Franciscan, who notes the system of measuring rice. The smallest standard measure, chupa, is \"the ration of cleaned rice sufficient for each meal of a man\" — a logical way to measure something that every man eats. The other measures have been, he notes, adjusted to Spanish measures, thus: one caban is \"one fanega of the standard of Toledo,\" and contains 24 gantas; one ganta (gabang, Salop) is 1/2 of a Toledo almud; 1/2 ganta is called a quartillo; and a chupa is 1/8 of a half-almud.14 Wine. It is logical that the friars, being of ten drinking men, should devote much more at tention to wine and liquor than they did to \"comestibles\" or food. Colin writes that the common wine is made from palms (coconuts, nipa) or from sugarcane. Cane wine is made from the \"sap of canes, boiled \"so that it becomes like red wine, although it does not taste so good.\" Palm wine is made from:... the sap or liquor from which the fruit was to be for med. For as soon as the palm begins to send out the shoot from the efrd^of the twig, and before the flower is unfolded, that flower-stock is cut, and a bit of bamboo is fastened to it and is tied to the stalk or shoot. Since the sap naturally flows to that part, as in the pruned vine, all the sap that was to be converted into fruit, flows into that bamboo and passes through it to vessels where, somewhat sour and steeped with the bark of certain trees which give it color, heat and bite, they use it as a common drink and call it tuba. But the real and proper palm wine is made from the same liquor before it turns sour, by distilling it in an alembic in ovens that they have prepared for it. They give it a greater or less strength as they please; and they get a brandy [lambanog ] as clear as water, although it is not so hot [as our brandy]. It is of a dry quality and, when used with moderation, it is considered even outside 28 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Filipinas as healthful and medicinal for the stomach and a preventive of tvatery humors and colds.15 Pastells notes that nipa wine was called Tanduay, and that a famous Chinese mestizo called Anacleto del Rosario had found a way to remove the \"disagreeable taste\" and make it equal to Spanish brandy in color, smell, taste and strength.16 The Visayans, another \"Relation\" records, make a rice wine called pangasi, an \"add-water-only\" almost-in stant wine:... the method of making it is to place in the bottom of a jar of or dinary size (... generally of two or three arrobas...) a quan¬ tity of yeast made from rice flour and a certain plant. Atop of that they put clean rice until the jar is half full"

Obviously, Father Delgado was inte¬ rested in writing natural history and in die process supplies some data on edible plants and animals, either native to the Philippines, or brought in from India, Mexico, Spain or elsewhere. Rice, which we see was a matter of in terest and curiosity to the Spaniards, and a food of symbolic as well as central value to the Filipinos, merits one of Father Delgado's longer chapters (six pages). Entitled \"Del arroz y otras especies de alimento,\" it begins with wheat, which he says deserves first place because of its \"nobility and utility.\" Although Christ said that man cannot live on bread alone, he points out that the Indios can live by rice alone, and feel that even if that is all they have, they have to fast as the Church commands; but if they do not have it, then they are free of the obligation (not eating rice is not eating at all). The method of cooking rice — husking, polishing, boiling in water — is noted, and also the rice cakes made from the sticky rice (pilit). One of these is bibinca, which is taken with chocolate and for breakfast; another is poto (\"to rtas grandes y amasadas, muy esponjadas y blancas, y... a proposito para el chocolate\"); and the third is suman (good to eat with meat). He notes that sometimes this is cooked with coconut milk and sugar, but considers the best type the one cooked in bamboo, which turns out \"gustoso, con color y sabor, y excita el apetito,\" as well as being convenient to carry around in the mountains, where no cooking vessels are available. The little cookies and pastries (golosinas, he calls them) made from rice he calls by Spanish names — broas, marquesotes, rosquetas, and judges them so excellent that Spaniards no longer miss cakes made from wheat flour, and valued them as gifts. Rice gruel he calls cinogao [nilugaw]; it is fed to the sick when they cannot eat any other strengthening food. Rice in broth he considers suitable for both the sick and the healthy; rice with carabao milk is appreciated even in Spain, where the rice is in ferior to the local varieties. Of these he names 93 30 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food types (bulac-naga, cadayhag, daragangan, magsanaya, etc.), while admitting that on other islands there are undoubtedly many others. Father Delgado feels that rice must be very similar to the manna which God sent the Israelites in the desert, since the small white morsels of food would be very much like the whitest rice congealed in dew, and also because in it alone they found all the flavors that they desired. \"Sustento suave, blanquisimo, oloroso y muy connatural,\" the natural bread of all India and Asia, he calls rice — so fine and delicate that even Europeans no longer desire the whitest and most valued breads made from wheat. The lowly camote or sweet potato, reliable stand-by in the peasant diet, and for difficult times. Father Delgado calls \"not noble like the other foods written about.\" Twenty-nine kinds he names, of this most or dinary of food, the peasants' literal \"daily bread,\" respon¬ sible for keeping them healthy and robust. Father Delgado's little chapters on fruit are useful in that they identify which are native to Philippine soil (mango, nangka), which were brought over from Mexico, then called Nueva Espana (guava, cacao), and occasionally the ways in which they are cooked (pajomangga or paho are pickled in brine and called [a]chara, which is an aid to digestion). Of bananas he names 57 varieties, the greatest number in any country of the Indies, he says, where it is a native fruit.20 Fr. Manuel Blanco's famous Flora de Pilipinas (1877), with its giant engravings of Philippine plants, is botanical in in terest, and thus the mango is classified under botanical names: Mangifera in dica or manga de in dias is what is locally called kalabaw, the largest of the mangoes; and the smaller piko is called mangifera rostrata. There is barely any data on food customs or values, only notes like: the manga in dica is believed to cause sleepiness as well as a light skin eruption that can be removed by bathing (popular belief says that mangoes cause prickly heat); and there is a mango that smells of anise, but about which Father Blanco seems doubtful. The best usage of Father Blanco's work would seem to be in conjunction with Father Delgado's, so that the historical/anthropological may illumine the botanical data.21 Vocabularios, etc. If the stray ifacts from the ethnographic accounts, and the lists of Father Delgado and Father Blanco open the door only slightly on the secrets of Philippine food before and during the Spanish colonial period, a more direct avenue is opened by voca¬ bularios, diccionarios and artes de la lengua — works generally ex¬ amined by literature and linguistics scholars rather than by food researchers"

The Vocabulario de la lengua tagala by Juan de Noceda and Pedro de Sanlucar, published in 1754, is an example. It was begun in the 17 th century by the Jesuit Clain and is believed to contain or ally transmitted folk material dating to \"the period of the first relations between the Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine Food 31 native and Spanish cultures (1570-1699)/,22 This would mean that the food words in cluded in it date to the time of the first contact with Spain, and would thus suggest the food then available (cultivated, hunted), the ways in which they were processed and cooked, and something of what they meant to the Filipino population of Cavite (where the words were gathered in early Spanish times. First of all, of 713 food-related words listed by Noceda and San Lucar, 160 pertain to rice — varieties, planting and harvesting, and cooking; 144 pertain to fish — varieties, fishnets, baskets, cooking; and the rest are divided between the names of fruits, of vegetables, of tubers, of shellfish and other sea creatures, and of meats (domesticated and game), the latter being definitely in the minority. From the physical count alone, we know that the contemporary Filipino peasant diet of rice-and-fish is the traditional one, almost surely the pre- Spanish food pattern — logical because of the agriculture-based economy, and the preponderance of water sources for food. We also know that meat was a latecomer to the diet (a friar has noted that in the beginning, the Indios did not eat beef, and their dogs did not disturb the calves; \"but now the Indians eat beef, and the fields are full of unruly dogs\"23), and that of these meats chicken was the more common item. The chicken was surely bred for cockfights as well as for food because many names identify particular kinds and colors of cocks (e. g. alimboyoquin is a red cock with black-spotted wings and dark feet), a concern of the sabungan. Copcop, the word for a hen's sheltering chicks under her wings, is also the word for taking in and cherishing — sure proof of domestication. Few words relate to pigs and cows. The words relating to fish reveal the contours of native fishery. The names of fishes (banac, biya, bangos, candoli, loualo, lumahan, lumbalumba, malacapas, malanay, mamali, taniqui, talilong, gilong- gilong, pingolpingol, pantat, etc.) are all of native or igin, showing that this was a native, pre-Spanish territory of activity. Also from this lexicon we learn the kinds of nets used in fishing, the kinds of baskets used for carrying fish, cooking processes, and that fishes were so familiar that they were used as referrents in poetic imagery: \"Isda acong gaga sapsap, gagataliptip calapad, cay a naquiquipagpusag, ang calagoyo, i, apahap,\"24 (I'm a fish the size of a sapsap, no wider than a barnacle; but I'm creating quite a stir because I'm swimming around, with a big apahap.) The sapsap is a small, flat, thin fish — humble food — while the apahap is one of the more highly-prized fishes. The image compares \"small fry\" to a small fish like the sapsap, about as little as an oyster, that keeps company with \"a biggie,\" an apahap.

Together, the words paint a whole picture, in which are the technology and the lore of growing rice. Baslay is the term for the stage at‘which rice starts to sprout; dapog is to transplant the seedlings; maymota is rice in blossom; apao is to ear, the grains growing as the stalk “grows tall; bayoquin is rice that does not fruit well; carato is three-month-old rice; dumali is four-month-old rice; cogo is rice half dead from drought; catoro are rice [stalks] when they ate the size of the in dex finger; cotlo is to cut the rice stalk with one's finger nail; dali is early rice; habhab is rice in completely milled; baloyot is a rice basket; calahan is dirty, half-rotten rice; day ami is rice straw; amabong and baysa are granaries; bayo is to pound rice with a pestle and mortar; asoc are the blows given in the bayo process; losong is a mortar; darac is husk left after the rice is milled; caslang is to help mill rice; cabay is a basket for measuring rice; gilic are the fine fragments generated in the milling, which cause itches (that can be removed by bathing — in rain water, goes the popular belief); pamago is new rice; hilapas is rice badly milled; day ami is also the term for falling ill because of having eaten new rice; dacot is a handful of rice, and dacotan is to scoop up handfuls of rice for someone; balangauan is rice that is somewhat black because it has been wet. The cooking is almost as detailed. Alimpuyoc is to burn the rice, at which time the smell is called angi. Balantogui is cooked rice that has been dried in the sun and then refried. Qilao is to cook rice in water slowly. The boiled rice prepared for every meal is called sinaing. To \"to ast\" or fry rice is sangag or busa, unless it is green (young) rice, which is tanac. The to asted rice is called binolaclac, or bosa if the^grains burst — also bulaclac [flower], because the burst grains look like flowers. Sometimes, in cooking the rice in a dry pan, some grains do not open and are called bato. If the cooked rice is hard, it is called bascalanan. Panghal is to leave rice to cool in the cooking vessel. Qisa is to mix corn or shredded camote with rice before steaming it — a method of extend¬ ing. Botohan is cooked rice — plain, with out seasoning. Green rice makes a special delicacy called pilipig or pipig. When rice is cooked soft and wet, as a gruel, it is called logao. Grinding rice into flour produces galapong, and from this comes a whole array of rice cakes — bibingca, suman, palarosdos, palitao, palotan. This galaxy of cakes of different sizes and colors — eaten with sugar, with grated coconut, with sugar mixed with to asted coconut, etc. Historias, Cronicas, Vocabularios: Spanish Sources for Research in Philippine Food 33 — marks most of the festive days of the native calendar, the way special breads mark the feasts of the German calendar. The generic name for them is cacanin, obviously derived from canin, the generic name for cooked rice. We find other uses for rice: cosisap are rice crumbs used for baiting fish; pais is to to ast a rice cake. The Filipinos were particular about their rice (Father Delgado named 93 varieties; Noceda/San Lucar have names for sticky, dark, tiny, large-grained, fragrant, etc., rice), and even had a name for cooked badly-milled rice: sinili. The rice wine earlier ment ioned, pangasi, was made from pastilles of cooked rice called tapay. Rice was meant to accompany every meal, serving as accom¬ paniment for the viands — the word olam (viands) meaning \"to be eaten with rice.\" This factor shaped the tastes of viands. Food that was not rice or fish (which must have been the usual) but greens, had a special name — auoy. Pouring soup on one's rice and eating it that way is called bahoc; to eat raw or to asted rice is to diim., All these rice-related words are of native or igin and were obviously in use before Hispanization.

We create words for what we need to talk about, and what is not in our vocabulary is not in our lives. Rice is obviously very much in the lives of Filipinos — as a physical, eco¬ nomic, symbolic, perhaps mythic entity — and the dictionary tells us so. We might check, too, related word lists like Pigafetta's — the first Western recording of Philippine language. Rice is bughax (bugas, the Visayan word for rice); and \"certain rice cakes\" are tinapai, the word now used for bread. A study of Chinese loan words shows that among the different categories — vegetables; food preparation; soy bean products; in struments; pork, beef, fish and other sea food; fried or soupy food; flour and rice products; fowl — the rice products have the fewest loan words from Hokkien (from which most Chinese borrowings come). Significantly, there are considerably more Chinese loan words for vegetables and pork; Spanish loan words cluster around beef cuts.25 The rice-related loan words do not signify varieties, processes, or cooking methods, but rice products of obvious Chinese or igin — bihon (noodles) and bilobilo (small steamed rice cakes). It does seem that the rice technology is native, Philippine and pre-Hispanic. It seems, the refore, that in Philippine food research it is es¬ pecially the language that holds the secrets of the past. The stray 34 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food - notes in ethnographic records are in general quite vague, and lacking in details — the words can flesh them out, especially when they are searched out of the diccionarios and vocabularios of the more than 80 Philippine languages, and compared with contemporary and surviving food practices. The language can then unlock the secrets hidden in it through history. DGF NOTES 1. Antonio Pigafetta, \"Primo Viaggio in to rno al mondo \" (1525), in James A. Robertson and Emma Helen Blair, eds.

In his home and restaurant menus are found dishes with vernacular names like laing and paklay, Spanish names like emhutido and mechado, Chinese names like to kwa and bihon and even Chinese food with Spanish names, like camaron rebozado dorado con jamon — all companionably coexisting. The reason for the confusion is that Philippine cuisine, dynamic as any live and growing phase of culture, has changed through history, absorbing in fluences, in digenizing, adjusting to new technology and tastes, and thus evolving. Filipino food to day as shaped by Philippine history and society 38 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food consists of a Malay matrix, in which melded in fluences from China and India (through trade), Arabia (through trade and Islamization), Spain and America (through colonization), and more recently the rest of the world (through global communication).1 A special path to the under¬ standing of what Philippine food is, can be taken by examining the process of in digenization which brought in, adapted and then subsumed for eign in fluences into the culture. \"Eating,\" Naomichi Ishige, a Japanese anthropologist, has said, \"is the act of in gesting the environment.\"2 It is quite certainly also in gesting culture, since among the most visible, most discernible and most permanent traces left by for eign cultures on Philippine life is food that is now part of the everyday, and of ten not recognized as for eign, so thoroughly has it been absorbed intp the native lifestyle. This particular aspect of cultural borrowing and change bears in vestigation; not only are the results of immediate and gut-level concern t& every Filipino, but the process is one in which not only a few, but the greater majority of Filipinos, participated. The process of borrowing went on in in numerable Philippine households through many years. It was a conscious and yet unconscious cultural reaction, in that borrowers knew that they were cooking for eign dishes while making necessary adaptations, but were not aware that they were transforming the dish and making it their own. Pancit, for example, from a Chinese noodle dish, is now the signature of many a town or region (pancit Malabon, pancit Marilao, pancit habhab of Lucban), and of many an in dividual (pancit ni Aling Nena). That certainly shows that both evolution and creation have been in volved. The process seems to start with a for eign dish in its or iginal form, brought in by for eigners (Chinese traders, Spanish missionaries). It is then taught to a native cook, who naturally adapts it to the tastes he knows and the in gredients he can get, thus both borrowing and adapting. Eventually, he improvises on it, thus creating a new dish that in time becomes so entrenched in the native cuisine and lifestyle that its or igihs are practically for gotten. That is in digenization, and in the Philippines the process starts with a for eign element and ends with a dish that can truly be called part of Philippine cuisine. Methodology. The principal difficulty in this in vestigation is methodology. The evidence for this research is generally consumed, digested and transformed — and thus no longer available in archives, or for carbon dating. Yet in a way one can say that the evidence is always being manufactured and discovered anew, every day, in every meal in every home. Still, the work of one cook is not hafd and fast evidence, and is fraught with variables and at best can only in dicate a pattern"

Eventually, he improvises on it, thus creating a new dish that in time becomes so entrenched in the native cuisine and lifestyle that its or igihs are practically for gotten. That is in digenization, and in the Philippines the process starts with a for eign element and ends with a dish that can truly be called part of Philippine cuisine. Methodology. The principal difficulty in this in vestigation is methodology. The evidence for this research is generally consumed, digested and transformed — and thus no longer available in archives, or for carbon dating. Yet in a way one can say that the evidence is always being manufactured and discovered anew, every day, in every meal in every home. Still, the work of one cook is not hafd and fast evidence, and is fraught with variables and at best can only in dicate a pattern. Secondly, to conventional research methods like documenting and comparing variants, recording changes and seeking reasons for them, one Culture Ingested: Notes on the Indigenization of Philippine Food 39 must add critical and analytical tasting — a process difficult to stand¬ ardize and imprison in for mulae. For this preliminary exploration, I have used a method that combines examination of the dish as done in the or iginal culture and as extant in Filipino cooking, and then analysis to determine the culture change or pattern discernible from this. Names. How then does one recognize these in digenized dishes on the Philippine table? Firstly by their names, since these were of ten borrowed along with the dish. Siopao, for example, is a Hokkien borrowing that suggests the cooking process, steaming, pao being steamed bread. Pancit, which comes from the Hokkien pian + e + sit is still recognizably Chinese, although or iginally it did not necessarily mean a noodle dish. Gloria Chan-Yap tells us that it literally means \"something that is conveniently cooked\" and in dicates the frying pro¬ cess. Since noodles are easy to prepare by frying, the word of ten, but not necessarily, means noodles. Pesa in Hokkien simply means \"'plain boiled' and it is used only in reference to the cooking of fish, the complete term in Hokkien being peq + sa + hi, the last morpheme mean¬ ing 'fish.'\" Chan-Yap cites this as an example of semantic \"widening\" since in Tagalog pesa in isolation does mean fish, but can mean \"boiled\" when one says pesang manok. However, the point remains: the names in dicate the or igin.3 Adobo is the noun derived from adobado, the name of a stewed meat dish in Mexico, from where Carmen Guerrero-Nakpil says the Philippine adobo comes.4 In Spain, however, adobo is a pickling sauce, made by cooking to gether olive oil, vinegar, garlic, thyme, laurel, or egano, paprika and salt. The Filipino has thus given the name adobo to a particular dish of chicken or pork-and-chicken, and derived from it an adjective to describe other foods using the same or a similar cooking process (adobong pusit). The term adobado has moved from the dish to the process of stewing in a spiced or flavored broth (e. g. \"Ang itik sa Angono'y adobado na bago prituhin,\"),5 thus using the basic meaning — to cook in a pickling sauce. And in deed Philippine adobo is adobado, but in condiments chosen by the native taste: vinegar and garlic, bayleaf and peppercorns, and more recently soy sauce, the Chinese contribution. Some borrowings from Spanish are literal and do not undergo semantic shifts like the above: cocido, salpicon, croquetas. Some are only portions of the or iginal name, e. g. came mechada (meat with a lardoon), has become mechado; gallina rellenada has become relleno, relleno in Spanish being the for cemeat with which one stuffs the Chicken. Especially in teresting cases are dishes like pescado en salsa agrio-dulce and morisqueta to stada, which in spite of their Spanish names are really Chinese. These are panciteria dishes, which in the Spanish period were translated into Spanish for printing on menus. The 40 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food dishes entered the native kitchen from the panciteria and so retain the Spanish names. Some of these menus survive in small panciterias, and although the years have corrupted the spelling in amusing ways, the Spanish words cloak a Chinese dish which most Filipinos recognize as Chinese, but now consider Filipino. Semantic analysis of the names of food would thus reveal or igin, something of the nature of the change and also further in for mation. For example, the Chan-Yap study finds that loanwords are fewest in the category of rice products and fowl, and suggests that this may be because both rice and fowl had long been food sources for Filipinos, who \"already had in their possession the culinary words appropriate for describing referents\" in these categories"

On the other hand, the fact that there are many loanwords for meat {goto, kamto, kasim, paykot, liempo) suggests that the Tagalog people learned the habit of'eating some meat cuts, especially pork, from the Hokkien speakers and the habit of eating beef from the Spanish, since many of the terms for beef are Spanish (punta y pecho, cadera, lomo, solomillo).6 Ingredients. The in gredients contained in the or iginal dish, and those in the local edition, are also clues to the process of in digeni- zation. Noodles in Chinese cuisine, for example, are generally cooked and flavored with meat and vegetables to flavor the noodles. Filipino pancit has local meats and vegetables — and a few other things not found in Chinese cooking at all. Pancit Malabon, being the signature noodle of a fishing town, has squid and oysters and salted eggs, which in dividually may conceivably be found in a Chinese dish, but not in that combination. Pancit Marilao has crumbled okoy of rice flour, since its home base, Bulacan, is rice-growing country; pancit palabok has flaked tinapa and crumbled chicharron. The tinapa is from the native cuisine (smoking being one of the ways of preserving food in the days before refrigeration), and chicharron is from the Spanish, but they are combined in a dish of Chinese or igin. A special example of adaptation through in gredients is pancit buko, in which flour noodles are replaced by strips of young coconut cut and treated like noodles. Bringhe would also be an example of a cultural change made through the use of in gredients from the Philippine landscape. Paella is generally made in Spain with chicken or rabbit, with rice and seasoning, especially saffron. Bringhe does use chicken, but the rice is malagkit and the sauce is coconut milk, to which is added a bark called ange, which turns the rice green in stead of saffron yellow. Paella was created from the Spanish country landscape — the rabbit scampering by, the chicken bought from a farmer, the saffron which is the most expensive spice in the world, and grows in Spain. Eating paella, there¬ fore, is in gesting the Spanish landscape. Eating bringhe, however, is in gesting the Philippine landscape — the chicken running around on the farm, the coconut from a nearby tree, and the malagkit for fiesta Culture Ingested: Notes on the Indigenization of Philippine Food 41 cakes. This is a clear example of in digenization through a change of substance, spirit and name. The Cooking Process. This is probably the anvil in which many a cultural change is fired and given a Philippine shape. We have already ment ioned adobo, in which stewing with spices became stewing in vinegar, garlic, pepper and bay leaf, in the process making sure that the dish would keep long with out need of refrigeration and endowing it with that slight sourness that is a favored Philippine flavor. Pag-gigiw, or sauteeing, is a technique for eign to the in digenous cuisine, which is mostly boiled, roasted, or steamed (halabos). It may have been learned from the Chinese stir-frying, in which food cut up in small pieces is moved quickly around in a little oil/lard. But certainly most of it was learned from the Spanish (the terms gisa/gisado, de¬ rived from the Spanish guisado, or cooked dish, in dicate that), who saute in olive oil with perhaps an on ion and a garlic clove. The Filipino sauteeing, however, has become set into a pattern: heat the oil; saute the garlic till golden brown; add the on ions and saute till soft and transparent; add the sliced to matoes and saute till cooked, and then add sahog (the principal flavoring in gredients, usually shrimps and/or pork) — and then add whatever else is being cooked, like beans for ginisang sitaw. Through the years it has become a standard for mula, and many cooks say that the secret of good cooking is in the pace and contents of the gisado. One must know exactly when the next item should be added, and it is also said of good cooks that their pag-gigisa can make any lowly vegetable or leftover taste good"

One must know exactly when the next item should be added, and it is also said of good cooks that their pag-gigisa can make any lowly vegetable or leftover taste good. What we have here is a particular in digenizing process dis¬ covered and set through the years. The Filipino gisado has to have that garlic, on ion, to mato and sahog base, and this preliminary process can Filipinize anything — cauliflower, leftover fish, scrambled eggs, noodles, paella (restaurateur and chef Leny Guerrero says that is the secret of her paella), and even canned mackerel from Japan (collo¬ quially called sardinas). The sahog may be optional, but not the garlic, on ion and to mato; while in Spanish cuisine a guisado may have one or two of the above, but not usually all three. The Filipino gisado is in deed an in digenizing process all by itself. Flavoring. If the gisado tunes the food to Filipino tastes, even more so do the dipping sauces called sawsawan and the standard table sauces like bagoong and patis. Bagoong and patis are used not only to salt food, but also to give the food an acceptable Filipino taste. Tales have been told of Filipino travellers and honeymooners venturing into alien cuisines armed with bottles of patis. No matter how strange or different the food, the patis gives it Filipino flavor, so that the diner's culture-bound taste buds can relate to it. What really adjusts the food to the in dividual and his learned food values, and adapts it to the particular regional, in dividual culture 42 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food of the diner, is the sawsawan. Chinese food does not have this galaxy of flavor-adjusters: vinegar and garlic; kalamansi; soy sauce, patis and garlic; bagoong, to matoes and on ions; green mango or kamyas with to matoes and on ions; chicharron, bagoong and coriander leaf; bagoong Balayan and kalamansi; sinamak — vinegar in which chilis, garlic and pepper are marinated; native pearl on ions (sibuyas Tagalog) and vinegar (sukang Iloco); miso (soy bean cake) sauteed in garlic, on ions and to matoes; sliced fresh to matoes (for fish); sliced paho (tiny, tart mangoes); crushed tamarind, etc. etc. — and now, of course, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce as well. What does this mean, and why is the Filipino diner allowed to tamper with his food in such profligate, extravagant ways? When he does, the chef in the kitchen will not threaten murder or suicide, because it is understood that the diner can take, part in the preparation of the dish by using his sawsawan. I read this as evidence of the sense of community of the Filipino, the bond between all cooks and their clients, all the backstage crew and the guys on stage, the farmer and the neighbors and relatives who form his support network. It is like plowing a field or moving a house bayanihan style; it is like a whole town staging a komedya, when even the director is not the absolute dictator, hermanos and elders having a large say in product and process. The sawsawan is itself another in digenizing process. The Filipino conquers the for eign taste and culture with an army of sawsawan, in sists on participation and in volvement, accepts nothing passively, but takes active part in the creation of his food. The sawsawan is not dish- specific, not assigned to particular recipes, although there are some traditional partners. This is in deed an arsenal with which to meet and subdue the for eign in vader, and render him/it acceptable to the native culture. It in dicates an ethos completely different from that prevailing in France, where the chef is the master creator and has sole authority over the dish. For the diner to tamper with it is discourtesy and in sult. In the Philippine experience, the diner cooperates and participates, and the creation is communal. The sawsawan thus transforms not only the taste, but also the relationship behind the experience. Social Position. Still another element that must be examined in the process of in digenization is the social position given the dish in the cross-cultural transfer. In China, for example, siomai and siopao are food of everyday, eaten at breakfast, or at tea-time, not generally at festivals or for main meals"

In China, for example, siomai and siopao are food of everyday, eaten at breakfast, or at tea-time, not generally at festivals or for main meals. Where do we find them in the Philippine menu? At merienda, in homes, schools, the streets; not usually at principal or festive meals either. These foods, as well as most of Chinese cuisine, entered Philippine culture at \"ground-level,\" at the level of everyday food, and found their final place there, among the kakanin of the native culture. Since the in gredients and the mature of Culture Ingested: Notes on the Indigenization of Philippine Pood 43 these dishes were found compatible with the budget of that level, and with the other accompaniments (such as tea, coffee and salabat), the social rank in which in digenization ensconced it in Philippine cuisine was equivalent to that which it held in China. The porridge (lugaw ) with chicken, fish or pork of Chinese breakfasts and late-night suppers is now the arroz caldo (note the change of name and language) and goto of Philippine meriendas and late-night snacks. The everyday noodles of China are also or dinary in the Philippines — mami, lomi, pancit bihon — although with special in gredients they can become fiesta food, just as there are special noodles in China. The Spanish food absorbed into the culture, however, has acquired a high social position and is located in the level of special, or festive food. Cocido, in Spain, is a simple dish in which one finds a meat (beef or lamb), and a piece each of blood sausage (morcilla), salt pork (to cino), and ham — items found hanging in almost every Spanish kitchen — cooked with garbanzos and a bit of cabbage. It is daily food, or dinary, a pot thrown to gether, a one-dish meal that is not special. In the Philippines, however, since the ham and sausages are rare in the native kitchen and, being imported, are expensive, the dish has ascended the social ladder to become special food, for Christmases and family reunions. When set against the background of the in digenous fish-and-vegetable cuisine, this is in deed a rare and expensive dish. Moreover, coming from the alien, dominant culture, it acquires a cachet of \"class\" and a position in the cuisine of the elite. It would, quite simply, be beyond the or dinary man's budget. Paella has had an even more noticeable change in social position. Originally a dish cooked in the field in Spain, the paellera set on at ones over a wood fire, the in gredients whatever could be conveniently found in the field (a rabbit, a chicken), in the Philippines it has become the prime fiesta food. Because it is Spanish and special, it is usually enriched with pork, chicken, crabs, clams, prawns and Spanish sausages (rare then, expensive now). The wine added to it in Spain is generally table wine, which, is drunk like water; while cooking with wine in the Philippines means adding something rarefied and expensive. Thus the social transformation of paella has much to say about the or iginal (colonizer) and receiving (colonized) cultures, as well as about colonization and the process of culture change. We thus note that the Chinese food now found in homes, merenderos, school cafeterias, cheap restaurants and the streets, came in from traders and not from conquerors. The food of the conquerors, because of both the source and the sheer cost, can now be found on fiesta tables, on the dining tables of the elite, and in expensive restaurants, where it is billed as Spanish and not Filipino food.

This was the standard for in digenization — taking the process to mean that by which the for eign food is made compatible with the native cuisine. If the for eign-in fluenced food in the culture has Chinese, Spanish, Mexican and, in Mindanao, Arab and Indian roots, it would follow that the in digenous cuisine would be all the rest that is in the food lexicon. Here would belong the sourstewed (sinigang, paksiw), steamed (pirn- singaw, halabos), roasted (in ihazv) and boiled (nilaga) — the termi¬ nology, we note, exists in the vernacular — dishes we still have in the present. The in gredients for these are culled from the landscape: fish and shellfish from the seas, rivers; brooks, streams, flooded rice fields; the flesh of domesticated animals like pig and chicken and yes, dog and carabao, and that of undomesticated (wild) animals like usa (deer), baboy damo (wild boar), musang (wildcat), bayawak (iguana), paniqui (fruit bat); other edible creatures like kamaru (mole cricket), salagubang (June beetle) and locusts; and of course the leaves, bulbs, tendrils, seeds and fruits of the ever-green Philippine landscape. The cooking methods probably evolved from the freshness, proximity and availability of the in gredients. Native wisdom shows that the best way to treat these is to cook them very little, or not at all (kinilaw). The cuisine did not evolve sauces because there was no need to disguise flavors going bad or slightly off (one function of sauces and spices in Europe). Sour cooking, smoking and pickling evolved because there was need to preserve with out refrigeration. This native cuisine is also subject to the flavoring provided by sauces like pads and bagoong, and the sawsawan, because this is where the communal creation of food started, in the agricultural lifestyle of the tribal communities of the pre-Hispanic Filipino. In this cuisine are expressed the flavors of the native to ngue and taste. It is to this standard that the for eign foods are contpared, and to which they are adjusted in budget, taste and economic level. This is quite naturally the cuisine in the heartland of the Filipino, the one he longs for when he is away, the one he finds comforting. It is part of his ethos. This is a cuisine linked and allied to those of the rest of Southeast Asia. With the rest, it shares rice as a staple food — rice treated not only as cereal, but as background for* all other tastes, and thus determinant of other tastes — rice as ritual food, rice not just as ex¬ tender but as highly valued taste and aroma. With the rest it also shares the extensive and varied uses of coconut — water, flesh, milk, heart of palm. There is an easily perceptible similarity between sinigang and all the sour broths of the region, like the Thai to myam. And there is a common use of fermented sauces, like bagoong (trassi in Culture Ingestedd: Notes on the lndigenization of Philippine Food 45 Indonesia, blachan in Malaysia, kapi in Thailand, mam tom in Viet¬ nam) and patis (nam pla in Thailand, nuoc mam in Vietnam, petis in Indonesia). This native cuisine is, amazingly, hardly changed in nature or spirit. Sinigang is still soured with sour fruits and leaves from the Philippine landscape. It is still as flexible, friendly to any kind of fish, meat or vegetable, adjustable to any kind of budget or circum- * stance. What has become available to sinigang, however, is new tech¬ nology. Sour broth from tamarind can now be had in an in stant \"add- water-only\" package, which Filipinos consider good for emergencies and for Filipinos in the US, but which housewives here scorn to use because the fresh in gredients are available and of better value, even if less convenient. Paksiw and in ihaw are still cooked in the same way, even though the need for coal fires and preservation in vinegar is no longer present in houses with gas and electric stoves, and refrigerators.

The native cuisine proved itself strong and resistant to \"fraternization\" with the for eign in vaders. The or iginal dishes have retained their in gredients, cooking methods and spirit. Foreign dishes have been Filipinized, but Philippine dishes have not been Sinicized or Hispanized. The cultural in teraction has been one of borrowing whole dishes, then adapting and in digenizing them, rather than borrowing elements to impose on native dishes. The result is a cuisine enriched rather than bastardized, its in tegrity kept, its dynamism that of judicious response to change. Could this perhaps serve as an analogue with which to under¬ stand in digenization in language, in the atre and in other areas of Philippine culture? Surely the pattern cannot be identical in all areas. Perhaps in some the borrowed elements may have overwhelmed the native for ces. But it is important to realize that in food, the most popular form of popular culture, created by the mass in their daily activity, in an act of unconscious transformation and creation, this is what happened. The native culture stood firm and \"kept the faith,\" borrowing only technology (freezers, pressure cookers, in stant flavorings) when neces¬ sary, but not changing in essence. Foreign culture was tried, examined, adjusted and then used as the base for creation within the Philippine lifestyle. The fact that borrowed Spanish culture came to have a high 46 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food place in social estimation and regard is eloquent about colonization and the at titudes it engenders in the colonized. It also suggests that the colonial at titude (ment ality) may not have come about only because of conquest but because of such a pragmatic dimension as cost, budget, economics. (Chinese food is definitely within reach; the in gredients of Spanish food are not.) Only the native elite, not the masses, could afford the colonizer's lifestyle, and so the for mer became colonized not only by the desire to emulate prestige and class, but through their wealth. These preliminary notes on the in digenization of food suggest further research: on the linguistic factor, the names not only of food, but of cooking implements and processes; and on the nature of all the culinary sources, and the change in them through in digenization. What, for example, do the carajay, sianse and sinaing in dicate about native and adapted food? The transformation of the Cantonese break¬ fast, rice porridge, into the goto and arroz caldo of the Philippine merienda — what does it say? Research should also be extended to such related subjects as the service of food, food etiquette and ways, the non-nutritional functions of food (ritual, medicinal, social), and the further functions of food as language (what are all the many messages it bears?). We have suggested how eating is the in gestion of culture. Deeper exploration is called for. When the Filipino adapted paella and pancit, pag-gigisa and pressure-cooking, what effect did that have on him, on his culinary culture and on the future of the native culture? Food, obviously, is not only for eating. DGF NOTES j* 1. cf. Doreen G. Fernandez, \"Food and the Filipino,\" in Philippine World-View, Virgilio G. Enriquez, ed.

We sometimes mistake what actually refer to our sense of to uch as words referring to taste, such as malutong, marabo, makunat. We tend to make the same error with words which refer to smell, like mabango, maanggo, malansa; or to temperature, like mainit, malamig; or to vis¬ cosity like malapot, malabnaw, maligat. This must be because our sense of taste is connected with and/or is in fluenced by the kinetic, olfactory, viscous and temperature-related quality of the object about to be placed Taste as Language 61 in the mouth or already in side the mouth. Actually, the ma- prefix refers to a quality in herent in the object, such as ma-puti, ma-dumi, ma-taas, ma-kinis. The teeth, the lips, the skin or surface of the to ngue, and the buccal region report the in herent quality of the food object. Thus, for in stance, makatas, madulas, mali- gat, marabo are thought of as words which refer to the gustatory sense. Three Tagalog words refer to the tastiness of food: masarap, malasa, malinamnam. Malasa and m&linamnam refer only to food, while masarap has a wider domain. One can say \"Masarap siyang umibig or \"Masarap siyang mangusap-,\" or \"Masarap siyang makisama\" The difference between \"lasa\" and \"linamnam\" becomes obvious when we look at their verb forms. \"Lasahan\"means to find out the flavor (\"tignan ang lasa\"), i. e. if the food, usually one under preparation, is maalat, maasim, matamis, etc. \"N amnamin\" has a finer nuance; it means \"to savor.\" II Of the five basic tastes — maalat, maasim, matamis, mapait and maanghang — mapait is connected mainly with a concoction of goat in nards in goat's bile, a dish relished almost exclusively by the hardy Ilocanos. Maanghang is a constant in the food of the Bikolanos, a taste we identify with a region. Matamis we think of as a fruit or fruit preserve or an equivalent (dessert, or himagas) taken after the main dish. It is not usually a taste present in an ulam. Thus, if we regard mapait and maanghang as regional peculiarities, we can safely make the assumption that maalat and maasim are the tastes basic to all of us. Or to be more specific, these are the basic tastes of the food we eat. Doreen Fernandez was correct in saying that sinigang is our national food. Ecology dictates taste. Economy elands the range of what we in gest. The ecological givens of our existence are, first, we live in the tropics, and second, our basic food is rice and our meals revolve around rice. Salt replaces the sodium chloride we lose when we sweat. In¬ gesting salt in patis, bagoong or even toyo as taste-regulators or as sauce keeps the salt balance in our body. The unbelievable amount of salt Ilocanos take in as bagoong (as is, or in their ubiquitous dinengdeng and abrao) should make renal patients of them all. Yet an epidemic of kidney ailments has not yet been reported in the region. Our rice has a sweetish taste, and salt goes very well with it.

Saltiness in food makes one thirsty, and the water lost in evaporation through the skin has to be replaced. Yearning for water is one of our constant drives. The most delicious sinigang I have tasted was prepared by Tomas Agulto, the resident Palanca poetry awardee of barrio Sagrada Familia, Hagonoy, Bulacan. He took us to Manila Bay, where his barriomates gave us newly caught fish. On our way back to Sagrada we stopped by a spit of land where on an improvised stove the sinigang was cooked; salt and to matoes were the only in gredients. It takes about the same time for fish and to mato to be cooked. The to matoes were dropped in whole, and were crushed only when we were about to have the sinigang, which was thus newly soured when we ate it with the newly cooked rice. Of course, we all had a good, cooling, refreshing sweat. In my freshman year in high school decades ago, our horticulture class drained the school pond and we broiled the hito and dalag. Salt was placed in the slits of the fishes and sprinkled on their heads and bodies. When the fire sizzled it was the signal to turn them, for the oozing of the fat between the skin and the flesh meant it was just right for eating. A little too late would have made the fish very dry and its skin brittle and bitter. The sauce was unforgettable — broiled tamarind fruit. We peeled the fruit, recovered the liquidy flesh, removed the seeds and added a little water and salt. Both sour in gredients — one for boiled fish and the other a dip¬ ping sauce for broiled fish — were fresh, temperature-hot, and made contact with the fish just before the boluses of fish were eaten. They could not be kept, nor were they*meant for eating later. They called for immediacy, for the most exquisite sourness of our food partakes of the quality of happiness fleeting, of joy that can only be arrested by memory, and like all ecstasies they have the construct of the ephe¬ meral. % III The generic word to in dicate the lack of \"lasa\" \"sarap\" or \"linamnam\" is matabang. The root word \"tabang\" means lack of saltiness, and fishes are distinguished according to source: is dang tabang (fish from the river) or isdang dagat (fish caught in the sea). Taste as Language 63 There are many barrios named Tabang to refer to riverine places. However, the word could also mean a lack of \"tamis\" (sweetness), or \"asim\" (sourness). It actually in dicates not \"absence of\" but \"lack of\" the taste proper to or expected of the food. In other words, it is a qualitative word that refers to degree. When one wants to be specific about the lack of an element in the cuisine, one refers directly to the lacking in gredient, as in \"kulang sa alat,\" \"kulang sa asim\" and so on. The opposite of kulang is labis, but more of ten the Spanish loan word sobra is used as its antonym. There is thus a range defined by \"kulang\" on one end and \"sobra\" on the other. When one is cooking, one adjusts the amount of in gredients to produce the right degree, i. e. their right combination, which makes one say the dish is \"masarap na\" This degree of correctness of the combination of water, spices, fish/ meat and other in gredients which go into the cooking, is usually expressed as \"tamang-tama\" or \"tamang-tama ang asin\" or \"tamang-tama ang alat\" The qualitative word for this is ka tamtaman. The Filipino cook has by upbringing and practice, or simply put, by acculturation, a parameter of taste which refers quantitatively to the in gredients of the dish he is preparing or qualitatively to the flavor of the dish he is cooking. He does not use exac V measures or measuring in struments. Cooking the Filipino way is a continuous dialogue between the \"measures\" in the mind and the food-on-the- stove. When the two converge, one makes the judgment \"tamang-tama\" (ang lasa). The Filipino cook is ever tasting the food-on-the-stove, and the exact term for it (meaning to taste a very small portion) is tikim. He is also for ever adding a little salt, a little vinegar, a little water, in the process of adjusting to wards tamang-tama.

Alis Na!\" The crucial words in the first two are, as demonstrated above, also used in cooking. These are words which extend their domain to politics and to social relations. \"Na\" in dicates the end of a process and could mean, if the word it precedes is related to degree, the emphatic, full-stop emotion of the speaker in reference to that word. Of course, the above slogans cannot be translated into English because the emotional processes of Americans and Filipinos are different. That is, \"Too much!\" and \"Enough!\" are improbable election slogans for the U. S. Taglish — it has to be Taglish — can, however, express the emotive content of the slogan: \"Too much na\\\" \"Enough nal\" Certainly, then, the emotive content is carried by \"na.\" 64 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Tama carries the meaning of \"right,\" \"correct,\" and the refore \"enough\" or \"just right\" (\"tamang-tama\"). Katamtaman must also come from the same root word, tama, and expresses the correct balance, meaning not kulang, not sobra. Our idea of that which is right is one of moderation, of balance. But, as in cooking, this is achieved in an on going, fluid, dynamic dialogue. For us, social relations are such a dialogue. They also have a flavor; there is a flavor or food-taste to our social relations. Note how our words related to taste also encompass our relations with others: \"Natabangan na ako sa kanya;\" \"Matamis siyang' umibig \"Masarap siyang makisama.\" Even words used in daily transactions have the flavor: \"Hindi makain ang mga salita niya.\" Words do have taste; to us they have a delicacy: \"Matamis siyang mangusap.\" Yet it is very noticeable that alat, asim, pait and anghang are not used in a social context; they are food-bound. Tamis extends to lin¬ guistic skill (\"Ang tamis ng dila niya;\" \"Ang tamis niyang mangusap \") as well as to love or affection (\"Ang tamis mong umibig\"). Positive ability and quality are what take one a long way in one's social relations. They focus on the in dividual or personal as opposed to the relational. For the relational we use tab ang and sarap. Flavor lost is not \"nawalan ng lasa\" but tumabang, meaning that a relationship which had flavor came to lose it. Social relationship is not measured in terms of heat or water content although political commitment uses the terms nanlamig or lumabnazu or lumabo (loss of water clarity). Lasa and linamnam are also food-bound, while sarap extends to describe the delicacy of social relations, of pakikisama. The difference between tab ang and sarap is that tab ang is em¬ ployed in its verb forms, i. e. affixes in dicate the change of the flavor of the relationship in a time axis — tumabang, tumatabang — or in a focus-or ientation, that is, subject-or iented as in \"tinatabangan na ako sa kanya,\" or object-or iented, as in \"nagkatabangan na sila.\" Tabang thus considers or takes into consideration the time of the process of loss and/ or the process in volved in the lessening of affection. Sarap, strictly speaking, describes or in dicates the quality of the relationship. The important thing is that these food-related words when used in a social context refer to the relationship itself. Social relations have both conjugation and flavor. V Social relations are thus like food. They have taste. They are also like food being cooked. Cooking terms are also applicable to our relations with others. Thus, by extension, what we do in cooking or the structure of our taste-world, specifically the dialogue that is for ever Taste as Language 65 on going between the food-on-the-stove and the imprinted image in our heads of what its taste should be, is also the kind of dialogue — fluid, on going, dynamic — that takes place between ourselves and others.

We are eternally cooking, not only on stoves, but in our pakikisama, which is never a fixed for mula like a recipe, but an on going process of understanding and adjusting, with the other in mind. ENA Cooking as Language t yr l HAT do we Filipinos do with food before it enters the mouth? What transformation should it go through, if any, before in gestion? Does it change form, appearance, state? What do we eat as is? What is our concept of pre-cooked and cooked? What are their implications? Let's begin with what we eat as is: chico, guava, makopa, ara- tiles, to mato, lettuce. Or if it has rind/skin/shell, we remove this to get at the flesh, as with or anges, tamarind, avocado, guyabano, atis, carrots, bananas. Or in the case of buko we remove the husk and grate or scoop out the flesh or drink the coconut water from the shell. Many fruits, and some vegetables, the refore, we eat as is. They do not go through any cooking process. We eat them in their raw state. Or to put 68 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food it in another manner, we eat some plants in their untransformed state. Others are treated in the same manner as rice, fish, fowl and meat. They are boiled, broiled, fermented or preserved, fried. But let us go through the stages of food preparation step by step. Almost all that we eat is cleaned in water first. Those which we eat as is, those which need not be peeled, we can just wipe with our fingers or palms, or on our shirts. And then they find their way in side our mouths, between our lips, between our teeth. The cleaning becomes more meticulous if there are feathers, gills and in nards which must be pulled out, cut off, or cut out. Washing out is done with water, preferably running water. What is left can go through another stage of cleaning by exposure to air and sea, as. with in testines which are turned in side out and air-dried in the traditional way of preparing langonisa; or by soaking in water, for this is just the cleaning stage. The next stage is more exciting. One uses one's fingers — himay; or one wields a knife and applies the cutting edge — putol, taga, hiwa, gayat, gilit (a term specific to fish), tadtad; or one can use the back of the blade — this is also tadtad, but really closer to pukpok. II The terms for the way we use a bladed object are dependent upon the blade and the object on which it is used. Taga means wielding the bladed tool like a bolo on a \"massive\" solid, the aim being just to wound. Palakol is an axe, and a small one is used to cut (taga) big bones. Putol literally means to cut into two or more parts. Hiwa refers to slicing, to cutting off, or to a deep wound effected by 'a knife with less force than taga. \"Tinataga ang baka^pero hinihiwa-hiwa ang laman nito.\" For slices of fish, a vendor asks a buyer, \"Ilang hiwa, ho?\", meaning into how many slices should the fish be cut. But if the slice is not clean through, but only a slash on which salt is to be placed, one says gilit. Gayat means cutting meat or vegetables into thin slices. Baguio beans when placed in lumpia — ginagayat ito. (Tobacco sliced or cut into very thin slices for cigarette rolling or bilot is also ginagayat.) Putol produces bigger chunks. When the knife is wielded in an irregular, haphazard manner to produce pieces of uneven sizes, the action is called tadtad. The cutting of our food into various sizes, as in dicated by the above terms, is related to the final stage of the food preparation. Up to this point it has been cleaning and cutting"

The cutting of our food into various sizes, as in dicated by the above terms, is related to the final stage of the food preparation. Up to this point it has been cleaning and cutting. The in digenous ways of cooking require that thickness be in the ascending or der from ihaw to sigang to laga, and the fish could remain uncut (but cleaned) if the process is singaw or saing. The food after cleaning and cutting is now ready for the next stage, pagsasangkap. The root word sangkap means elements, say, of a Cooking as Language 69 for mula. In cooking it refers to those elements or in gredients added to the fish, meat, or vegetables, and these in clude salt, spices, on ion, gar¬ lic, to mato, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, miso, tausi, tahuri and the like. They are sometimes referred to as panglahok, meaning elements for mixture. The idea is that they are elements in small quantities added to the main or central element of the dish (fish, meat, vegetables) to produce a definite mix, the ulam. They are called pangsahog when the idea is that they add flavor, as shrimps or bits of pork do to a vegetable or noodle dish. When asked \"Ano ang ulam ninyo?\" (What food/viand do you have?), one can answer in the generic sense — isda, manok, baboy, baka, or gulay. In this sense ulam refers to the main or major element in the dish. Or in a very specific sense one can answer by naming the dish itself, as in pritong isda, nilagang baka or bulanglang. Ulam in our food world (pagkain ) is what we eat with rice, and if it is only salt, a sangkap, we answer the question by saying, \"Wala; asin.\" Salt, even when used as the only accompaniment to rice, is the refore not ulam. Ill Pagsasangkap can be the terminal stage for some food prepara¬ tions — kilaw, buro — meaning that the next step is in gestion. Kilaw utilizes something sour like vinegar or kalamansi, on ion, black pepper and of course, salt. The combination of these sangkap kills the lansa of the fish, shrimp, in nards, or meat. We conceive of these moving, living objects as having an in herent objectionable quality which must be removed to make them ready for eating. The removal of the supposed lansa (usually the smell of fish or of blood) which adheres to the food objects while they are alive, or is still present in them soon after they are killed, is a kind of cleaning or cleansing. The lansa becomes baho when the flesh begins to putrefy. In contrast, stationary living objects like fruit and vegetables need only be wiped or water-washed to ready them for eating. We do not eat moving, living objects. The lansa is fictive in the case of river shrimps newly scooped from the baklad and the refore literally jumping. Yet when we were young boys we took salt and kalamansi to the rivers when we stole these shrimps. We ate them from our palms. Once when we for got our cleansing sangkap, we ate the shrimps nonetheless, and found that they had no lansa, but were sweetish. Our refusal to eat such living food objects is imbedded deeply in our psyche. Lansa is something to be exorcised. Even the food of fering to gods or icons, known as at ang among the Ilocanos, should not have lansa. There is something repulsive in even newly killed or slaughtered moving, living objects. The kilaw sangkap is thus for cleaning and cleansing. More specifically, lansa is connected with blood. Malansa 70 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food ang dugo. It is the blood which must be purged out; death must be exorcised to transform the dead object into something acceptably edible. We are not repulsed by the food object as it is; we can eat a food object even if it does not undergo transformation in shape and appear¬ ance. We eat balut and kamaru (mole cricket). Or to take more sedate examples, we do not find the cut-off head of a lechon repulsive; in fact, we display it in the middle of the food-laden table as a sign of conspicuous luxury.

Buro is the preservation of food in brine or in fermented rice. Vegetables such as mustard leaves, fruit such as green mango and san- tol, eggs, small river crabs (talangka), can be kept in brine. Hito, dalag, gourami and other fishes or shrimps can be placed in fermented rice. The idea is to prolong their usefulness since they are seasonal, and thus available in large quantities for short durations. During the months when food supply is lean, they are always available as ulam. Some buro are eaten as is (talangka, mango); others need cooking (burong dalag is sauteed). IV The other use of pagsasangkap is to prepare the food for cooking. There are two kinds: one, as preservative for later cooking; and the other, as preparation for immediate cooking. Immediate cooking means cooking over fire soon after the condiments are mixed. There are generic dishes such as laga, ihaw, sigang, or even saing and singaw. Pagsasang¬ kap could go on while the dish is being cooked. Salt, vinegar or pepper could be added; water could be lessened; the taste of the dish undergoes finer and finer adjustments while the kawali, kaserola, or kaldero is on the stove. For preservative purposes there are several ways. Salting and drying split-open fish produce daing. The word, however, also refers to marination {babad) of the split-open fish, say bangus, in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and pepper. Of course, there is also daing na pusit, meaning dried squid. Tapa is meat-specific. Here the thin slices are salted and seasoned, or marinated in a flavoring liquid. Tapa can also refer to dried venison or boar's meat preserved in just salt. Tinapa, however, is fish dried by smoking. Daing and tapa are ways of preserving either by drying or marination. Now we come to the final stage, the cooking proper. This means cooking over fire. Cooking directly over charcoal is ihaw (corn, egg¬ plant, squid, fish, meat); cooking in or over steam is singaw (vegetables like kamote tops, fish, or chicken as in pinaupo sa asin) or halabos (shrimps); and cooking of fish or rice in water by letting all the water evaporate is saing. Laga (corn, peanuts, saba bananas, eggplant, egg. Cooking as Language 71 kamote, potatoes, fish, meat) requires more water, so that one has a large amount of broth (sabaw) in the end if one is cooking ulam. And if there is pampaasim or a souring in gredient, it is sigang (fish, meat plus vegetables). If it is cooked in vinegar it is paksiw (fish, lechon). Of course, there are the in digenized (adapted) cooking processes as well: prito, guisa and adobo. The terms make distinctions according to the amount of water and the presence or absence of a souring element. Except in ihaw and singaw, the ulam (main component plus sahog, the solid addends like pechayt cabbage, mustard leaves, potatoes, beans) is boiled in water. We somehow look for sabaw to ease the eating of rice and to produce a cooling effect on the surface of the body by making us perspire. V Let me recapitulate at this point the four stages of our food preparation: paglilinis, paghahanda, pagsasangkap, pagluluto. The first two are germane to all cooking procedures. The last two have to be analyzed for distinctive features if we are to find answers to the queries in the first paragraph of this essay.

Such a variety of food preservation methods implies an abundance of various foods — fruits, vegetables, fish, meat. The economy of plenty suggests moderation in consumption; the cycles of nature dictate preser¬ vation for future use. Richness of food rests in variety, not quantity. We explore variety and by that we enrich our palatal experiences. Pagsasangkap refers both to preservation steps and steps imme¬ diately prior to cooking. If more than preservative salt and vinegar are used then there is sahog or lahok. What do we achieve at this stage? There is respect for the main food element as-it-is — meat is expected to taste like meat, fish is in deed fish-y — the different sangkap are not expected to change the taste of the main component. Pinatitingkad ang lasa nito. Taste is not altered but enhanced. A change in appearance is not desired; the way the food looks in nature is respected. The in tegrity 72 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food of the main food component, in both taste and appearance, is main¬ tained. There is a change of state (e. g. isda can be dinaing, sinigang, pinirito, in ihaw, pinasingaw, sinaing) but not appearance. Pagluluto means the food going through fire directly, or in directly through boiling water or steam. Kinilaw na tanguingue is not luto; it is kilaw. Burong hipon is not luto; it is buro. The firegoing process trans¬ forms the food from the raw. to the cooked.

We don't like durog na pagkain; we want to see the elements in their \"natural\" form. The solid sangkap, even the pang- asim or to mato, however, can undergo changes of appearance. Lastly, the idea of lansa. We are repulsed by raw blood, say in liver or chicken, but we do eat blood in its cooked form, e. g. dinuguan, or chicken blood curdled in uncooked rice in nilagang manok. Luto removes lansa. In kilaw the suggestion of blood-Zflnsa is removed by the strong combination of salt, black pepper, on ion and ginger, and it is \"washed\" in vinegar (or \"cooked\" in acetic acid). We do not have a single word for \"raw.\" The closest is Hindi luto, which means it has not gone through fire. But kilaw is not Hindi luto; it is kinilaw. It can be in gested as a dish which is luto. Objectively speaking, kilaw or buro is really just pagsasangkap, for to the main food component are added sangkap. However, the fact that these can be eaten immediately places them under the same category as luto, for after this stage the food is in gestible. They there¬ fore strictly belong to the last step of the process, that immediately prior to in gestion. Kilaw and buro are distinct from our food preparation process. Like luto they are ready-to-eat; the lansa, if any, has been removed; and the food has undergone a change of state (non-buro to buro, non -kilaw to kilaw), though not a change of appearance. VI What are the implications of the descriptive analysis above? What does this tell us about ourselves? Let me begin with the noncooking context of some of the words discussed earlier. Lansa is also used in relation to menstrual blood. Himay can mean to analyze, as in \"Kung hihimayin natin ang mga sinabi niya...\" Babad gave birth to tele-babad, signifying using the phone lengthily (usually a teenager — nagbababad sa telepono), or watching TV to excess — nakababad sa telebisyon. It is also used to mean magtagal, to stay for a long duration, as in \"Mahilig siyang mag- babad doon sa nililigawan niya.\" Buro means staying put for a long time, as in waiting for someone at a bus station (\"Naburo na ako sa kahihintay sa iyo\"). However, it Cooking as Language 73 9 implies disapproval since the next stage is mabulok: \"Nabulok na ako sa kahihintay sa iyo\" — which implies dislike for having been made to wait long. Over -buro, of course, results in bulok"

Note as well the mean¬ ings of lutong Macaw (prearranged, usually machinations), and lutong Macoy (\"cooked up\" the Marcos way). Some food preparation terms have thus extended into the nonculinary world of behavior. Such borrowings serve to identify the basic characteristic of the words the mselves. The more important question, however, is whether our preingestion food preparation is an image of the process which ideas/emotions/impressions go through prior to our \"taking\" them in. Do ideas/emotions/impressions go through the same process when we put them to gether? Cooking is putting to gether elements which until then were not in relation to one another. Cooking is in deed creation. I want to single out the last two steps, namely pagsasangkap and pagluluto, for cleaning, cleaving, cutting are common to all culinary preparations. How do we put things to gether? There is a traditional mode as there is a traditional cuisine. History has determined our ways and tastes. Tradition has predetermined the end result. To get to that end we are given an amount of freedom for free play. The play takes place between the cook, history and the'food elements. In pagsasangkap there is a main component — fish, or meat mostly — and to it are added sahog (the addends) or lahok (those to be mixed). The mixing into or the putting in of the non-main components is really what pagsasangkap refers to. \"Pag-\" is a prefix which signifies \"the act of;\" \"sa-\" is a repetition of the first prondunceable combination of sounds of the root word sangkap that signifies repetition, i. e. sangkap is added not once, but over and over or several times. Strictly then, the act of putting in sangkap does not end at a definite point immediately prior to pagluluto, but is repeated even during the pagluluto stage. The adding of salt, pepper and water takes place even when the dish is boiling. Taste adjustment, pagtikim, ends only when the cooking pot is removed from the stove. Pagsasangkap is basically mixing, paglalahok. It also means participation (of cooking in gredients in the final flavor or result) since in a noncooking context lumahok is to participate, as in a conversation or an activity. There is a combination of results which is predetermined by history and tradition. It is not so much the end result, the cooked food to be in gested, which characterizes us, as the process which produces the end product. The elements to be combined are chosen not at random; one in fact uses substitutes for sangkap made unavailable. The process is similar to improvisation in, say, the Igorot song \"Salidum - ay\" We utilize what is available (e. g. recent events) and put them in 74 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food the grid within a predetermined, preexisting framework. The joy is in the combining; the ability lies in the creativeness that is based on improvisation. Pagluluto is basically the transformation of something not fit to in gest into something in gestible through the use of fire. When we say \"hindi pa luto,\" we mean that it is not yet transformed into the in gestible stage. We sometimes say \"hilaw pa/' as in \"hilaw pa ang kanin.\" The word can also be used for vegetables, fish and meat. However, we do not use the term hilaw to mean raw vegetables, fish or meat. Hilaw refers more properly to the not-yet-cooked state of the being cooked food elements. We refer to vegetables, fish and meat by their generic or particular name when they are raw or uncooked; we do not describe them as hilaw. For example, when we say talong, we mean uncooked eggplant; so with hito and baboy. When we refer to them as hilaw the implication is that they are being cooked, but have not yet been transformed into the cooked or luto state. In social relations hilaw is used, say in \"ang hilaw kong biyenan,\" to mean that the relationship has not yet reached the stage of real pagbibiyenan"

The marriage has not yet taken place; the relationship is not yet socially sanctioned. It is not an uncooked stage but rather one about to be cooked or about to be finally fully realized. Pagluluto is also basically a transformation of state with out a change of appearance. As in pagsasangkap, there is a main component and we add more or less, or remove more or less, but the adding or lessening is such that it does not destroy the basic quality of the main component. This is most especially true of our in digenous ways of cooking. Pagsasangkap and pagluluto are our ways of in digenizing for eign elements. They are our ways of adjusting such elements within the preexistent grids and parameters of our culture. They are also our ways of combining in digenous elements. We mix and combine in digenous and/or for eign elements in our culture in the way that we mix and combine the main components of our dishes (be they in digenous or adapted) with the sangkap. While we continually make the adjust¬ ments, we keep in mind the in tegrity of both the combinant elements and the molds into which they fit, but give form and substance in the process. All these processes take place in the context of already existing cultural forms. Because the dialogue is always with history, the old and the new, the main element and the sangkap, all keep their in¬ tegrity. That way balance is maintained and context remains. As with cooking, the preingestion of ideas, emotions and at titudes goes through a process which is a-logical, but which has its own exact grids and parameters. Only after these take definite combinations — respect, loyalty, joy, loneliness, love — do they enter the crucible of our Cooking as Language 75 in dividual sensibilities. Just as our cooking is a continuous dialogue, with adjustments being made at every point between pagsasangkap, pagluluto and the final serving and consumption of the product, from moment to moment we are creators shaping and being shaped in our ideas, our emotions, our at titudes, our relationships. We are not fixed, not rigid, not unchangeable. The creation of our selves is a constant process of change and adjustment, like pagsasangkap and pagluluto. This process, which calls not only for a consciousness of the culture but also for a flexibility and sensitiveness to nuances — this is what makes us Filipinos.

Kumain ako nang dahan-dahan and kinain ko nang dahan-dahan both trans¬ late as \"I ate slowly.\" However, kumain means I ate slowly, that is, my manner of eating was slow. Kinain implies that my eating of something was slow, that is, it is the eating of something which was slow. Kumain is focused on the eater while kinain is focused on the food eaten. Kain implies at least two participants: the eater and that which is eaten. Let us try the present tense and another form of kain: E. Kumakain ka ba ng kambing? F. Nakakain na ako, pero hindi ko tayp. Kumakain is the present tense of the eater-focused kumain. Its future form is kakain. To perceive our sense of the present, let us examine how it is for med. To the root word kain the in fix -IZM- is added to form k UMain. The first syllable of the root word is repeated to form the future tense KAkain. The present is thus a combination of the in fix -UM- and the reduplicated first syllable ka-: k UMa KAin. Our sense of the present is always present progressive (V+ing); it always carries a part of the recent past and at the same time it pushes into the future. When we say \"Kumakain ako,\" it implies that I have Eating as Language 79 been eating, I am eating, and I am going to be eating some more. The present is not. an absolute slice of time; it is a time segment in. which an action is taking place — a time segment contiguous with the recent past \\ and the proximate future. Time to the Filipino is continuous and con¬ tiguous. However, in the one-question, one-answer dialogue above, kuma- kain is used not in the sense of present progressive, eat-ing, but rather in the sense of whether F eats or is accustomed to eating goat meat. It refers to the other use of the Tagalog present tense: to in dicate repeated or habitual action — which in English can be expressed by the simple present tense — in contrast to one action in time-present. F uses nakakain in his reply. In the context of the dialogue, he means that he has had the experience of eating goat meat. There is another use of this form, however, and that is, to signify the ability, capability, possibility, capacity to eat. In the in troductory dialogue of this piece, C asks A if B was able to eat by asking, \"Nakakain ba naman? This nakakain is obviously eater-focused. Now, if we change the focus to the food and want to ask if it can be eaten, then we say \"Nakakain ba naman (ito)?\" Note how exactness is achieved by the affixes: G. Nakakain ba ito? H. Oo. Kinakain namin yan. G refers to the food, H to the eaters. To summarize, here is the paradigm for the two-level, eater-food relationship: PAST PRESENT Eater- kumain kumakain focused nakakain nakakakain (plural) nagkainan nagkakainan Food- kinain kinakain focused nakain nakakain III FUTURE kakain makakakain magkakainan kakainin makakain Eating in volves at the least two — the eater and the eaten. Even at this level, the eater's eating and the food being eaten do not take place only in time, as. in dicated by the tenses. Tagalog takes into consideration also: 1) whether the eater is just eating, or 2) whether his ability to eat is referred to, or 3) whether the food was eaten, or 4) whether the food can be eaten — four considerations conjugated in those tenses, or a to tal of twelve verb forms. Each verb form is the resultant of the crossing of two axes — focus and tense. The Filipino is at every moment a child in time and at the 80 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food same time the child of a relationship. Our every moment is a shifting situation.

There is food and someone (the actor) is feeding (pinapakain, nagpapakain) it to the \"eater.\" Or else the eater is eating in someone's house (nakikikain). If the focus is changed to the food, then it is being fed (ipinakakain) by someone to someone or something. The J utterances report not just the mere in gestion of food (eating), but also the act of feeding and being fed, and the fact of the money (ang ikakain) or in strument used in connection with the eating. The world of kain thus in cludes the kumakain, pag-kain, pagpa-kain, pang-kain; the eater, the food, the feeding, the in strument connected with eating. Each has a definite affix, meaning each is represented by a definite verb form. Or to put it the other way, each verb form represents an aspect of that kain world or the kain domain. Aspect is manifested by focus plus tense. The domain is compre¬ hensive since it consists of all the possibilities connected with the world of kain. Pick any of the verb forms of kain, and it will show you something about the eater, the eaten, the eating and the time referred to. For in stance, kinakain is in the present tense and in dicates that which is being eaten; it is a food-focused form. However, there is another verb form, nakakain, which could be characterized in exactly the same manner — food-focused present tense. The difference is that Eating as Language 81 kinakain refers to the food being eaten while nakakain refers to the eat-able quality of the food (i. e., that it can be eaten). The verb forms the refore make the fine refinements between seemingly similar aspects.

VI What does this world tell us about our concept of time? Further, what does it tell us about our mind — what it contains, how it perceives — and our feelings in time, in shape, in its shape-ing? What is \"meaning\" to us? What do we experience? What is the meaning of an experience? What of a complex of events is reported by language? What is it that is \"caged\" in vocabulary and syntax so that there is a semantics to the phenomenon? 82 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Follow the verbs and you have the shape of the answers, if not the answers the mselves. Verbs signify time simple (past, present, future), but the conjugations are not simple. Time can be durative. Kinakain spans, after strict analysis of affixes, the three \"segments\" of time. Time is the refore not segmented, not linear, but flowing. Time can be perfective, e. g. nakain. The conjugations thus signify, too, aspects of an event, an action, a relation. Duration. Continuities. Perfections. There are moments but these are not only moments by and in the mselves. They are also moments in a timeflux or even moments that transcend flux. Tapos na. Finished. Completely. Perfected. The past can be past in itself. Or past in fusion with the present and pushing into the future. And the distinctions are always there. Is the emphasis on the perfecting of the action? Or is the stress on a state now over? Different or ders of time there are for different states of mind, of feeling, of consideration, of awareness. Tagalog is a language of verbs. Of continued and continuing awareness. An awareness that constantly parses time, or ders it in terms of durations, continuation, perfection. An awareness that keeps smoothly shifting focus — from, to, between speaker, person spoken to, person spoken of, objects spoken of.— at the same time considering these in terms of time passing, of time in flux, of time as durative, perfective, continuative. The verb in its in flections and conjugations captures the reality of the moments, the reality of this flow as experience. And the mind? What does it say of the mind? It is a mind that feels. Feels for itself, by itself; feels for, feels of, feels to, feels in, feels into, feels by. And the feeling? It is a feeling that minds, that is minded, that re-minds. Meaning is a complex of awareness. And language catches this as experience, as structure. This is the actual world for us. A world of time parsed and caught in its simple and complex states. A world of changing focus. A changing blend-of-focus- and-time: of focus changing, of time changing, of focus and time changing; even of focusing change, of focusing time, of focusing changes and time. Things are taking place in people, between people, between events and people, between things and people — singly, simultaneously in time simple and time complex. Not only time is in flected and conju¬ gated. People are. Things are. Events are. Ours is a world of continuous in flections and conjugations. And our language catches that in all its changes and continuities and they become our experience. And the meaning? Like a poem, more than meaning it is be-ing. The or der of time, the state of relationship. The state and or der of a relationship. Be-ing is being aware. And being aware means being in the flux. In durative, continuative, perfective time. Decisions are made. Responsibilities are taken. Events happen. But in time there are only aspects. Meaning is be-ing in-flux.

Depending upon the means or in strument we use to carry the food from the table to the mouth, we say kamayin, kutsarahin, tinidorin. \"-in\" is a verbal affix which in dicates use of the root word, usually a noun. Thus, of similar constructions are siniko, tinuhod, brinaso. However, the words \"nginu - so\" or \"nginipin\" or \"ngusoin\" or \"ngipinin\" do not exist.

Meaning is be-ing in-flux. ENA How We Eat: Ways and Determinants t E begin to eat when we take the food from the table, plate, banana leaf, or pot. Depending upon the means or in strument we use to carry the food from the table to the mouth, we say kamayin, kutsarahin, tinidorin. \"-in\" is a verbal affix which in dicates use of the root word, usually a noun. Thus, of similar constructions are siniko, tinuhod, brinaso. However, the words \"nginu - so\" or \"nginipin\" or \"ngusoin\" or \"ngipinin\" do not exist. Obviously, we do not pick food from the table with our lips and teeth. Neither do we say \"dila-in.\" The closest etymologically is dilaan, which is not rela¬ ted to food. One sticks out one's to ngue as a sign of coquetry or as a wild gesture of teasing or anger. We rub our lips with our to ngue, wet them slightly, smack our lips very lightly, and in mock self-constraint push How We Eat: Ways and Determinants 85 air from the buccal cavity through our nasal openings in a rising tone. The sound that comes out is \"mmm MM.\" It signifies appreciation or liking for the proffered food or cuisine on display. Of course, we only go as far as in haling the aroma of the food. We do not eat through our noses. II When asked if the food that is already in the mouth is delicious, we do not open our mouths and say \"Masarap\" afraid to spew the food out since there is a sibilant (\"s\") and a trill (\"r\") in the word. And the sibilant may throw out the food in a trill. Instead, with mouth closed, we give notice of our approbation by grunting a short \"Mmm\" and following it with several nods. For emphasis, we shake our shoulders and our upper to rso up and down. If we want to be more emphatic, we can sway our bodies for ward and back from the waist up or, if we are standing, we can keep a syncopated rhythm with our nodding by pushing our body up by lifting our heels. And sometimes we do all this even before we pinch the food on the table with our for efinger and thumb, or grab at it with all our fingers, or spear it with a fork, or scoop it up with a spoon. To continue. What we do next is contingent upon the particular characteristic of the food which is now in the mouth. If it is sabaw, hinihigop. If it is solid, it is kagat, nguya or ngata. The fact that there are three words means that we have three ways of biting food. Kagat is basically just the implantation or for ceful imbedding of the teeth, the •front ones up to the left and right in cisors (the fangs of wolves) on a solid object. Dogs bite and mosquitoes bite and men bite their food. After we bite food, say a leg of fried chicken, a bite or bits of it are in our mouth ready for mastication. Mastication refers to the repeated action of the teeth, now in cluding the whole set of upper and lower teeth, on the food. Saliva or sabaw moistens the solid particles which are reduced to smaller bits for easier digestion. \"Nguyain mo ang pagkain mo\" is how mothers keep their children at the table and away from the heat and dirt of streets and play yards. When children swallow their food in a rush by gulping it down with water, that is, with out masticating the food properly, mothers admonish them by saying, \"Gusto mo bang sumakit ang tiyan mo?\" To children, eating is an unnecessary bother; to mothers, mas¬ tication is necessary. Ngata has at least two uses: mastication of stringy or rubbery meat or the mastication of food by to othless elders, i. e. the gums take on the function of the teeth. The gums could be in cisive — they can halve green guavas cleanly or cut meat into small portions, or feel out the spines of, say, tamban. They can also function as molars — the flat surfaces serving as grinders. 86 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Food is usually submissive to the different machinations in the buccal factory: it is sequaceous to the to ngue, it is passive to the cutting, pounding, grinding action of the teeth. If a piece of chicken wing or leg \"jumps\" out of the bowl when one pierces it with a fork, we refer to it as \"tumatakbo pa yata\" or \"gusto pa yatang tumakbo.\" If the piece of meat, pork, chicken or beef is resistant to mastication, we say the meat fights back, lumalaban. These are the few occasions that they become active. Otherwise upon entry into our mouths they are at the mercy of nguya and ngata. Ill As kain is a generic word meaning \"to eat,\" so is inom, \"to drink.\" We drink soda pop, juice, water, buko water, milk; but sabaw requires a different verb, higop.

Our concept of sabaw. is not soup cooked as a separate dish, but rather the liquid portion of ulam Csinigang, nilaga, paksiw, bulanglang, dinengdeng). Thus we speak of \"Kulang ang sabaw,\" \"wala nang sabaw,\" \"naubos na ang sabaw.\" The water in rice is just \"tubig\" since rice is not ulam. Thus, we say \"dagdagan ng tubig ang sinasaing,\" or \"kulang sa tubig ang sinaing.\" Depending upon context, water has a different name. The plain, unadulterated H 2 O is tubig. Squeezed out, it is katas. In its evaporated-then-globular or liquid form, it is pawis (\"ang lambanog ay pawis ng tuba',\" \"nagpapawis ang baso ng kape\"). San Miguel makes beer out of it, and the verb is no longer just \"uminom muna tayo,\" but \"Mag-beer muna tayo.\" That's defjt advertising. When liquid is taken in gulps, it is lagok. But when it is something solid that is in gested rather speedily, it is lunok. There is an in voluntary twitch or a hint of resistance to that action — \"nalunok ko ang buto ng santol,\" \"lunukin mo na ang tableta.\" Lulun refers to rolling a banig; it also signifies swallowing, but not a jerky, abrupt gulp. There is no haste nor anger to it. If there is resistance at all, it is passive. Notice that the different ways of drinking and/or in gesting inom, higop, lagok, lunok, lulun are food- or liquid-specific. If it is something solid-with-liquid like balimbing or \"ulo ng isda\" or bulalo, the term is sipsip, and the English transli¬ teration is \"suck.\" But a sipsip is the opposite of a sucker. The latter is a victim; it is a passive situation. The for mer is active to adying. There is a word which is very food-specific and describes the whole process in volved in eating that food: pangos. This is specific to raw sugar cane; it covers all the steps in volved in eating sugar cane, from removing the bark covering of the cane with one's teeth (kagat), to biting off a bit from the stem (also kagat), masticating it (nguya, sometimes ngata), to in gesting the extracted juice (lunok), then sucking, squeezing the pulp with the teeth and lips (sipsip), and finally How We Eat: Ways and Determinants 87 spewing out the crushed and squeezed-out cane pulp. All those steps comprise pangos. Certainly there can be combinations of buccal strokes and styles. The steps in volved in eating a partially shelled balut are: higop, kagat, nguya, lulun, and when we come to the hard white albumin, it is ngata and possibly sipsip. In this in gestion path, there are these on omatopoeic quiet and not-so-silent steps. IV There are words related to the volume of food we in gest. Tikim, since it is for the purpose of finding out the taste of the food object, is in very small quantities — a spoonful of the sinigang being cooked on the stove, a morsel of the in angit, a pinch of tapa, a bit of suha. However, since we are not prone to eating moderately, especially if the food is (cost-)free, lanzones vendors have to put up huge in timidating signs which read: LIBRE TIKIM, ONE ONLY, or TIKIM UP TO ONE ONLY. Tikim is in deed of very limited amount. When we go to extremes, though, we go for the unlimited. To gorge is lamon or laklak. By their sound you can know them. In \"1\" the tip of the to ngue is behind the teeth; \"m\" is a bilabial; and V {lamon/ lamun) is a nasal. Not as much eating in there as in \"k,\" a laryngo^ pharyngeal sound bordering on the guttural, pronounced with the mouth wide open. Add to that a repetition of the 1-k combination, and in laklak you have a person whose mouth is still wide open even after he has eaten ten big platefuls of rice and different viands. That's gorging unlimited. Between tikim and lamon/laklak is the normative subo. The measure used to be the amount a person could push into his opened mouth with his hand. Now it's much less — it refers to a spoonful; more specifically, it now denotes one food-in sertion into the waiting mouth. Our mouths must have a very flexible capacity since we measure the amount we put in, not the amount our buccal cavity can hold. There is no such word as bibigan.

Tikim was ment ioned above as a volume-related word. Of course, it is at the same time a purpose-related word. A word which is also volume-related is papak. More precisely, it refers to the manner of eating, mostly solids, ulam and just ulam, i. e. with out rice. \"Gusto mong magpapak? Sige, mayroon pa namang ulam.\" It is not a manner of eating a main meal. Neither is it the manner of eating only viands when one is trying to lose weight. Papak takes place after one has eaten a full meal, or between main meals. It is the refore a \"repast\" composed only of viands, especially those with out broth. There is a broth-less kind of food which is especially ' prepared to go with alcoholic drinks: pulutan. This could be any kind: 88 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food vegetables, fruit, root crops, fish, fowl, pork, beef, mutton, venison, horsemeat, carabao meat, heads, tails, in nards, grass, worms, in sects, birds, snails, mussels, clams, frogs, turtles, snakes. If we could only digest wood we would also be feasting on newspapers, tree branches, tables. and chairs. Pulutan has not yet conferred acceptability in its class to dinengdeng, bulanglang, sinigang and linaga. Paksiw, pinangat, sinaing are not quite there either — except when there is nothing else. When you see someone having beer and, say, sinigang, be certain it is a meal, and the beer is a beverage just like coke or any soda pop. Kumakain, hindi umiinom. If the occasion centers on the inom (meaning that it is an in umari), then liquid foods are a no-no. In fact, the farther away the pulutan is from anything related to water, the more appreciated it is. Inuman kasi. The range can the refore be from as-is (as with green mango), to kilaw, to ihaw to prito. Rarities like pina- paitan, even if they have a little broth, are prized. The root word of pulutan, pulot, means to pick up. The \"-an\" suffix is similar to the ending of sawsawan, agahan, tanghalian and hapu- nan. It in dicates what one has for sawsaw, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It is the stuff that sawsaw and the main meals consist of, and are thus the sauce and the meals the mselves. Pulutan is thus what one \"picks up\" or picks at while drinking. One drinks inum-z Vz and one takes pulut¬ an with it. V With the radical change of government in 1986 some words have become popular because they are appropriate. Sipsip to signify a person who to adies to authority, and its verb forms (e. g. sumipsip, manipsip) have always been around, but have gained a new dimension with their political connotation. The many-sided balimbing debuted after Marcos left, and his supporters had to adjust their many-faceted needs to the change of milieu. A joke goes: Q. Papaano kinakain ang balimbing? A. Sinisipsip. The food domain is the most common to all of our sub-cultures and the most accessible source of terms for social or political phenomena. ** There are other terms which appear to have become a part of our usage. Lulun (to swallow, to roll a mat) is of ten heard in the Lope K. Santos world of the pangingera: nalulun sa bisyo, nalulun sa sugal. It is a precise image for the state when one's life, for tunes, one's very self are \"rolled into,\"and in deed swallowed up in one's vice, such as gambling. The word expresses a state in which one cannot extricate one's life from the vice. Lunok, as discussed earlier, denotes strained gulping and in a social context it means making a person accept what is repulsive to him. At the least, there is a resistance to it: pinalulunok How We Eat: Ways and Determinants 89 mo sa akin ang di ko malunok. The next three words — tikim, papak, higop — are used in relation to power. They assume a structure in which power is shared very unevenly. Tikim is a part of the language of protest of women. \"Ano? Anong gusto mo? Gusto mo lang akong tikman, ano?\" or \"Kayong mga lalaki naman, talagang gusto lang ninyong tumikim ng iba't-ibang babae\" The social matrix shown by such an expression is one in which women are morsels of food for men's picking.

Papak is used in a context of battle where one would, to mix metaphors, make mincemeat of the other. It is an uneven battle between a heavyweight and a flyweight, and the latter is the refore easy prey. \"Huwag ka nang lumaban sa kanya; papapakin ka lang niya\" The use of the word must come from the characteristic of papak — it is a light repast, an easy meal, sometimes just an afterthought. Eating is some¬ times thought of as a battle. The eater has an enormous appetite, like a piranha, and the food on the table is the object of his predatory at tacks. \"Mapapalaban ka sa kanya,\" the host is admonished, \"si Ike Lozada 'yon ng baryo namin\" Higop is, like lulun, a favorite word of activists. The Filipinos are victims being sucked up by a maelstrom (US imperialism) into its center, in which they disappear. In Tagalog, higop is also used in relation to quicksand (kumonoy ), but who wants to think of imperialism as quicksand? Imperialism is a whirlpool, a system that sucks not only blood but lives, swallows its victims whole. VI The way we eat is determined not only by how we eat but also by what we eat. The distinctive characteristic of the food can also define how we take it in. The terms are not only eater-centered; they can also be food-centered. Different foods demand different terminology. The terms have at least two axes: the eater and the food. This extends, however, as the food travels to the mouth, by in cluding the volume of the food and the purpose for the eating — a to tal the refore of four reference points. The matrix they form is not only exact; its elements are picturesque. Thus they can move from the table-to-mouth domain to describe social relations or political situations. The transference is based on likeness; the likeness carries the precision of the word in its or iginal linguistic matrix. In this matrix of relations there can be struggles (\"lumalaban ang karne \") or mock battles (\"mapapalaban ka sa kanya\"), but the overall situation is undemocratic. The food has a name but no rights what¬ soever. It can be appreciated, but it ends up in the mouth for immediate. 90 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food gradual, or swift swallowing, gulping, mastication. It ends up being in gested anyway. It is a very undemocratic situation. The idea of unequal distribution of power extends into the socio¬ political domain (tikim, sipsip, luriok, lulun, papak, higop) and there expresses too the basic in equality of relations. When social relations change, then conceivably terms related to how we in gest food would no longer be appropriate. Until such time, for exactness of imagery, our food in gestion terms would hold.

Still the same classic arrangement of plaza (now enlarged into a not-as-cozy park), church (patron saint: San Diego, feastday: November 13), munisipyo (spruced up, repainted, with a wailful of Silay statistics for the rare to urist), and public school buildings on a central square, and very near them the houses of the principalia — Locsin, Ledesma, Gaston, Gamboa, etc. It still does not have a commercial area, properly speaking, be¬ cause all important commercial and economic functions are carried on in Bacolod City, fifteen minutes away on a four-lane highway. But the main street on which cluster the few shops is twice as wide as it used to Hometown Food 101 be; there is now a new sports and cultural center, and the tracts of sugarland on which our house once stood, solitary, are now filled with new homes, stretching all the way to the cemetery and beyond. Still, there is the same somnolence, the same unhurried tempo, the same provincial pace. No one seems to age much, not even the old, two-storey houses that memory renders in even more gracious colors. And the food is still as special. All hometown food is special, of course. Not only is it born in and rooted to the place, and the refore authentic, but it is all of memory come alive. It is as genuine a product of the town as the son or daughter who grew up with it and calls the place a hometown. It comes from the culture, from the economy, from the resources and resourcefulness of place and people. Silay food will bear this out Sugar was the foundation on which the Silay economy and culture were built. In the 19 th century, when the Philippines was opened to trade with countries other than Spain, and sugar was found to be a profitable export, Iloilo became a major port for sugar trading. The planters, most of whom had farms below ten hectares in size, looked across Guirfiaras Strait at land-rich, underpopulated Negros and sent over sons or relatives to carve out the 500-700, hectare haciendas that made the \"sugar barons\" of a later day. Luckily, the Negros loam and weather were perfect for sugar, and so Negros Occidental soon became sugar country. As sugar became a major Philippine export, a lifestyle emerged that waxed — and then waned — with the sugar in dustry. A lifestyle of gambling and golf, jewelry and cars, gallant scions and sweet Indays, and not altogether unexpected occasional streaks of violence. Quiet, bucolic Silay used to have a lot of gambling for high stakes going on behind the walls of those gracious houses. Some, I was told (I never saw them) had sophisticated warning, hiding and escape systems built into them in case of an unlikely raid — unlikely because of pakikisama, because important of ficials were among the gamblers, because it was an unspoken part of the community lifestyle. Tales were told and zarzuelas were written about jewelry, land titles and car registrations flung on the gambling table; of haciendas lost in a night of gaming; of marriages sacrificed at the mahjong, panguingue or monte tables, or at the cockpit. * For these gamblers, I was told, were developed the kalan-unon (kakanin) for which Silay is famous, and the accompanying in stitution, the manug-libud (accent on ug and ud). The kalan-unon are portable food that can be eaten with out getting up from the gambling table, and they used to be made by the best cooks in Silay — maiden aunts, young wives, mothers, girls, many from the best families. The food is taken around by the manug-libud (\"libud\" means to take from place to place, usually to sell) to homes with or with out gambling, to restaurants and 102 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food schools, in large round baskets covered with cloth and carried on their heads"

Sometimes they carry additional food in fiambreras, cans or baskets slung on their arms. The vending used to be done on an in for mal schedule, which most people knew, but one could put in requests. What fun it was to call for Tia Azon or Tia Juanita, have her open the layers of cloth, waxed paper and banana leaves covering her large bilao; sniff at her wares, peer into her containers; exclaim over delicacies fancied for the moment or long longed for; foods old or new or remembered. What were in those baskets? Always, there was the famous Silay lumpia — crisp new ubud sauteed with pork and shrimps, garlicky, wrapped in the thinnest wrapper imaginable (egg-flavored on special occasions), with a jaunty spring on ion tucked in. Many other lumpia in the Philippines have the same basic for mula, but this one is especially tender, sweet and malinamnam for two reasons. First, the ubod is absolutely fresh, not having even passed through a market, since the best lumpia maker, Emma Lacson, in sists that the tree be cut down on the same morning that its pith is to be cooked. In fact, some farmers plant small coconut trees just for ubud — close to gether, since there is no in tention of having them grow tall or bear fruit. (Young trees are practically \"all ubud” but as the tree grows the pith gets smaller and less tender.) Thus the ubud that makes the Silay lumpia what it is, is not only fresh, but also young and tender. Second, the lumpia does not use a sauce to mask or tamper with its freshness — the garlic and other flavorings are sauteed into the filling. With the ubud at its prime, there is no sense in having a flour- thickened sauce with it, so it is \"'beauty bare,\" so to speak. Silay lumpia is traditionally served with a long, cool drink we call ensalada, made of chopped ubod, coconut water, fruit juices and fruits. The sweet freshness of lumpia and ensalada to gether is home distilled into flavor. When we occasionally fly lumpia to Manila for special occasions and friends, it is an eloquent gesture of friendship and regard. Also in the manug-libud repertoire was piaya — flat cakes sprinkled with sesame seed outside, lined with melted brown sugar in side — excellent with coffee, tea or salabat. The. dough is just flour and fat, kneaded with the skill of generations, such that the fat never comes out. The sugar is kneaded in, in the same way. It used to puzzle > me, as a child, how they could put the sugar so evenly into such a flat cake. Although piaya is now available in plastic packs or in boxes, in Manila, I still see it sold singly, from a leaf-lined basket, by a manug- libud. There are many specialties that never leave Silay, except when brought out by homesick Silaynons. Among these are Inday-Inday and Bae-Bae, both meaning, I guess, \"little women,\" since word repetition is Hometown Food 103 the Visayan way of miniaturizing. Inday-Inday is steamed malagkit rice and coconut; Bae-Bae is made of ground pinipig and young coconut. There are beef or chicken-filled empanadas with crisp shells fluted and pleated like mille-feuilles pastry (hojaldres, Emma Lacson calls them). And similarly-shaped panara, reddish of crust, filled with bean sprouts and crab meat. There are piononos (named after Pio Nono, or Pius IX), jelly-roll shaped, with vanilla cream filling; and the little round to rtitas, which are sugary and melting, with dough like that of the ensaimada. The chicken pastel is in but ter-rich patty shells; the plain pastel is a pinch of crust filled with banana or mango jam. Butong-but ong (literally pull-pull, the refore tira-tira) are tiny brown coconut candies, sesame-seed flavored; pacumbo nga lubiare rolled, sugared coconut frit¬ ters. The tiny siomai are filled with ubod and pork; barquillos are stuffed with polvoron; pili candy is wrapped in lumpia wrapper and called dedos; corn or cassava cakes are wrapped in banana leaves and called alupi.

Gambler or not, for whatever nuance of hunger or sweet to oth one had, the manug-libud had something. The monte or panguingue player never had to rise from the table, having only to reach for some delicious morsel — an act that was surely a metaphor for the old Negros lifestyle. Now, after the economic crisis and the drop in the sugar market, only Emma Lacson still supplies the one manug-libud vending her way around town. Tia Tilde Valencia and Tia Adela Locsin, who between them used to maintain 15 vendors, have passed away. The lifestyle and the economy have changed as well, and now vendors take Silay food to Bacolod — to schools, to beauty parlors and homes, to restaurants and stores. Their supplies come not from the famous cooks or the old families, but mostly from a small community called So-ol II, reached through a narrow bridge that has advanced from coconut-trunk to two- plank width, but still requires some balancing. So-ol has a delightful spirit and communality, for the son of a for mer manug-libud produces the traditional lumpia, empanada, piaya, etc. for sale in Bacolod, helped by relatives and friends. However, there is a sad side to the story, for the cooks' and vendors' finances are oppressively dependent on moneylenders (people within Silay's elite and power structure) who charge usurious rates (\"5-6\" or 2- 10% daily). Of the day's profits, very little is left for survival needs after the payment of in terest, and more has to be borrowed to produce the stock for the next day's sales. Another variety of Silay food consists of cookies and biscuits, * ' 1 104 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food called sopas, which are the mainstay of El Ideal bakery. This has resided on the first floor of the cream-colored Cesar Locsin residence since the 1920 s, but Alice Locsin-Villanueva remembers that itjonly moved there when she was two, and before then had stood farther down Rizal Street. The names of the sopas are a roll call of tradition: quinamunsil (shaped like camunsil, or kamachile); sinambag (shaped like sambag or tamarind); bafiadas (a cookie \"bathed\" in white frosting); broas or ladyfingers; bizcocho Principe and bizchoco de cafia; quinihad (a to asted, sliced breadlike biscuit); paciencia; masapodrida; galletas especial (very thin, wafer-like biscuits); hojaldres; utap; lubid-lubid (twisted like a rope). After these come what Alice calls \"or dinary\" bakery products — egg crackers, cookies with raisins, ugoy-ugoy, paborita, isda-isda, sugar cookies, hopia, Tres Ojos, Petros, and one of their most popular products — airlight, crunchy, white meringue. The sopas, in name and in character, in evitably remind one of the famous sopas de Molo, those biscuits in the red or green striped cans sold in Iloilo, which in clude galletas Lbanadas, hojaldres, quinihad, etc. That is, of course, just where they came from — Negros Occidental, we will remember, having been settled mainly by Iloilo families. Some of the Silay families came from Jaro, and many, like the Locsins, or iginated in Molo, then the Parian (Chinese quarter) of Iloilo. With them came the life ways, the lifestyles, the food. Emma Lacson and Marina Gamboa, both of whom learned their cooking from mothers and grandmothers, express doubt that the Silay kalan-unon were developed for the gamblers. They believe that the foods of tradition came from Molo with the old folks, and because mothers passed them on to daughters who in turn passed them on, they survived.

The sweetness of the economic rewards also made cooking something that could be done less for gain than for love and the satisfaction of doing. The specialties of Silay are thus kalan-unon and sopas not only of a certain flavor and quality, but of a certain history, lifestyle and culture. But life is not only snacks and morsels, of course. There is, less famous but more sustaining, the food of the everyday table. Silay food is not only kalan-unon and sopas, and this we are reminded of in the market, where the town's heartbeat is best heard. It is there that the truest democracy reigns, for everyone goes there, all the meals of rich and poor start there, the temper of good and bad times is felt there. The Silay public market has grown much bigger, with a clutch of farmadas and a row of carinderias outside, and a large dry goods Hometown Food 105 section in side. Walking through the food section is like reading through a lexicon, and finding the vocabulary of the Silay table. Greenness there is aplenty, lush and rich and healthy, the products of fields and backyard gardens. Everyone seems to sell alugbati (Ceylon spinach), which is much more a favorite among Visayans than it is among Tagalogs. There are bunches of the tendrils with the red stems, but also of the larger, more mature leaves and the fatter branches. These are sauteed with pork and shrimps, or with salted fish, or just with guinamus (bagoong). Delicate, curling colitis (amaranth) is there in fragile piles. During the Japanese Occupation, when much of our clan (grandfather, uncles, aunts, cousins) had evacuated to the farm, we used to gather this in the fields, where it looked like a weed between the much-taller cassava plants. Colitis is a humble vegetable, hardly found in Manila markets. It is good to remember that it exists in the Negros landscape along with sugarcane, the more prominent symbol of Negros life. There is a lot of gabi, but not as much as there is in a Bicol market, where it hangs, stands, is piled, bunched, cut up, bundled. Gabi is sold whole, or in piles of leaves, or in cut-up piles ready for the pot — slices of the root, and slices of the stalk as well. Boil it with ginger, the tendera told me, then add coconut milk, and at the very last add a few shrimps and susu, the dark pointed shells. Young langka abounds, which we cook with coconut milk and salted fish, or make into a salad with shrimps, to matoes, on ions and coconut milk. Some cousins reminded me of how, during the months on the farm during the war, when there were no markets to go to, we seemed to have langka for every meal. We marvelled how throughout all that time we — some ten families, along with the farm workers — lived off the land, which never seemed to run out of langka, colitis, malunggay, coconuts, kamoteng kahoy, etc. It was truly by the grace of the land that we survived. The Silay market vendors are a busy lot, chopping ubod for lumpia and also ubadr the heart of the banana stalk, which is cooked as a vegetable, sauteed with pork and shrimps. Most of the stalls of fered the range of vegetables above, plus healthy squashes, kamote, malunggay, kangkong, and the black-eyed beans called kadyos, which we cook with pork. * The dried fish section has the pinakas (daing), tuyo and binuro which we bring to Manila and treasure in our freezers. The gumaa is usually from Bantayan Island or from Cadiz, and its virtue is that it is not too hard, not too salty, its flesh soft, because it comes from nearby and is meant for immediate consumption. The binuro is salted fish packed in coarse salt, which one cooks in vinegar. My father's favorite breakfast used to be fried rice with scrambled eggs mixed in, and binuro broth and flesh, to flavor. There are also dried squid, uga balingon 106 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food (dried dilis and), sometimes the tiny lobo-lobo, or the palad (baby sole, about the size of small coins), but not usually the guinamus nga bihud, salted fish eggs (roe), which one must look for elsewhere (e. g., Pulupandan), or from special vendors. The fish section has a modest selection because not too far away is Guinhalaran, a fishing barrio"

The gumaa is usually from Bantayan Island or from Cadiz, and its virtue is that it is not too hard, not too salty, its flesh soft, because it comes from nearby and is meant for immediate consumption. The binuro is salted fish packed in coarse salt, which one cooks in vinegar. My father's favorite breakfast used to be fried rice with scrambled eggs mixed in, and binuro broth and flesh, to flavor. There are also dried squid, uga balingon 106 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food (dried dilis and), sometimes the tiny lobo-lobo, or the palad (baby sole, about the size of small coins), but not usually the guinamus nga bihud, salted fish eggs (roe), which one must look for elsewhere (e. g., Pulupandan), or from special vendors. The fish section has a modest selection because not too far away is Guinhalaran, a fishing barrio. It is there, in the early morning, that one can get a good look at what the sea contributes to the shaping of Silay food. At 4 or 5 a. m. the fishermen's bancas come, the fish are classified into bafieras. and sold to wholesalers and retailers who take their stock away in jeeps and tricycles. Sapsap, bangros (bangiis) and. lilang are standard. \"Finds\" are shark, frog legs, sting ray (which I first tried at a pasyon reading, cooked with turmeric and coconut milk), and especially alimusan, of the catfish family, the heads and tails of which we like paksizv, the body lamayo (sliced, salted and sun-dried for just a day). The meat section is fairly standard, with all the variety meats that we favor. Tripe, or bindonggo, is boiled till tender, then soured with batuan, made aromatic with tanglad and finished off with langka or kamansi. The spleen, liver and heart go into paklay, along with galangan (balimbing) and green pineapple, for souring. Chicken in Silay is always associated in my memory with in asal, the local barbecue, which used to be available at merienda time only in the market area. The chicken parts are marinated in tuba vinegar and garlic, then brushed with lard while grilling over coals. I loved the tang, the charcoal flavor, and especially the adventure of eating market food, not prepared in the safety of our kitchen, partaking of the mystery and perhaps danger of the market. Now in asal has become in stitutionalized, with a Manukan Country spread through the recla¬ mation area in Bacolod City, with rows and rows of barbecue-beer places set up, bearing the signs of soft drink sponsors. Now not only the standard parts of chicken are skewered for in asal, but also livers, gizzards, the side \"wings\" of gizzards, isol (the part that goes over the fence last), the hind parts of isol, in testines and cubes of chicken blood (solidified in vinegar and seasonings). The latter was good, dipped in sinamak — vinegar in which chili peppers, garlic and ginger have been marinated. It is said that a person's food tastes are shaped by the time he is ten. That may not be a hard and fast rule since in my and others' experience there are many food tastes that one can acquire as an adult. But surely it is childhood food — in this case, hometown food — that shapes not only the taste but the person (\"Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,\" says Brillab de Savarin's third aphorism) and thus the culture. Although I cannot as yet make the connection between hometown food and in dividual person or national identity, I suggest that it is Hometown Food 107 <* through in dividual explorations into hometowns — large and small, seaside and mountainside, northern and southern, rich and poor, sugar- supported and rice-nurtured, barren and fertile — and their food cultures, that we will finally be able to limn the soul the Filipino shows through his food. A soul that shapes national destiny (\"The destiny of nations depends on how they nourish the mselves,\" fourth aphorism), as well as national art and aspirations.

Thus the Bajaws of Tawi-Tawi eventually became citizens of the Philippines and the Bajaws of Sabah became Malaysians. Now that life is relatively better in Sabah, our Bajaws go in and out of Sabah for trade or employment. They are n 6 t required by the Malay¬ sian authorities to carry Philippine passports. In Tawi-Tawi itself the Sama are divided between those who live on land, the sedentary Sama Lea who are mostly Muslims, and the misunderstood Bajaws or Sama Laud, who are not Muslims and 5 who derive their livelihood from the sea (fishing, boat-building). Add to the Samas the Tausug and you have three in digenous groups living near each other. The Tausugs are warlike and have a long martial history. In their stories the Bajaws narrate having suffered most at the hands of the Tausugs. Most of these stories have to do with physical violence. The Bajaws refer to the Sama Lea as \"Muslims.\" All others, such as Taga- logs, Ilongos, etc., are lumped under the grouping \"Bisaya,\" which registers lowest in the consciousness of the Bajaws since they have had minimal contact with them. The Bajaws suffer discrimination from the Tausugs and the Muslims. Two hundred meters away from the village we visited is a public elementary school. However, none of the Bajaw children of school age study there since there has been a history of physical harassment from the non-Bajaw schoolchildren. In fact, only one child in the entire village goes to school, commuting to a Catholic school in Bongao. Not all the Bajaws live in houseboats. Most of them live in houses with posts dug into the sea, and thus in habit sea coasts. They are semi- sedentary in that although they go out of their villages for long periods to fish or to work in Sabah, they return to these villages, or traditional moorages. Sometimes, for political reasons, they have no choice but to abandon their villages. But they always return and that is why these traditional moorages are identifiable. Discrimination of ten has an economic motivation. In the case of the Bajaws, those who live on land dictate the price of the Bajaw sea catch. Since the Bajaws have no way of preserving their catch and have immediate need for cash, they have no choice but to sell to the Tausugs and Muslims who live on land. The discrimination has become in stitutionalized so that the Bajaws hardly venture out of their villages. ’ ' II \\ The spit of white sand no more than four hundred meters long The Bajaws of Tungkalang 111 called Tungkalang in Sanga-Sanga Island, is the mooring place of a group of Bajaws who have started to return after a dispersal which has lasted for twelve years. There was a whole village complete with a. Catholic school up to 1975. During the government's war with the MNLF, the place was strafed because the Bajaws were suspected of being allies of the MNLF. The government's ignorance victimized an entire village. Pitted against the power of the army, what could the Bajaws do? Some migrated to Sabah; others sought relatives in the different islands of Tawi-Tawi. Some took refuge in a temporary mooring place close to where the Bongao Catholic church was located — Look Bang¬ ka. Today only 42 have returned, trying out the for ces at work, hoping that now they have become hospitable to their return. During the decade of their diaspora, changes have taken place even in the physical setting of the moorage. Where passengers used to be ferried across the short span between Sanga-Sanga and Bongao, a concrete bridge was built for the development of both islands. This entailed, however, the dredging of the nearby sea of corals which were used to dam the end posts of the bridge and the newly-built road. The portions of the road close to the bridge were in fact built of coral, and even to day the vestiges of this rape of the shoreline speak eloquently of completely uninformed government development programming"

What in deed could the Bajaws do against the bullets of the army and the tractors of the DPWH? What resulted was not only the displacement of an entire village. A disruption and eventual destruc¬ tion of an ecological system systematically took place. The old mooring place disappeared. The currents of the sea changed. Like pitiful birds, some of the Bajaws tried to go back to their \"homes.\" A few anchored close to the bridge. But the rape of the corals was still taking place. The currents changed as the coral beds were being destroyed. The political and ecological in stability rendered return impossible. Ill Then one day, twelve years later, it rained and rained. The sea delivered sand to form a mound. The winds dispersed the sand. More sand welled out of the sea. After three days, a bar of fine white sand appeared. This was the rebirth of Tungkalang, which literally means point (tung) in a sand bar (kalang). It was Akmad, son-in-law of the village leader, Hajolani, who was the first to resettle. He had been biding his time*in Look Bangka. He wrote his father-in-law who was then in Sabah that the old village was being for med again. Akmad explained what a village is to them. \"It is home,\" he said. You can travel to Balabac and Sabah and even stay lengthily on different islands in search of a livelihood, but 112 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food you always come back to your village. It is your home. And this is what is called a traditional mooring place. According to their legend, boatloads of them came long ago from Jahur (Indonesia) for some unknown reason. One evening they secured their boats with ropes to poles, as they were wont to do. They did not know that the poles were thrust into the back of a giant stingray which in its displeasure swam away to dislodge the poles stuck into him. Thus, the bancas were dispersed to ten places: Sitangkay, Sibutu, Bela- tan, Sanga-Sanga, Jolo, etc. to as far as Zamboanga. These are the traditional Bajaw moorages. There is a legend particular to Tungkalang. Its leader, Panglima Bongao, who died in the 1950 s, asked Hajolani before he died never to leave Tungkalang. Whenever Hajolani thinks of abandoning the moor¬ age for good, Panglima Bongao appears in a dream, seeming to strangle him. The reappearance of Tungkalang from the sea is the work of Panglima Bongao, Hajolani avers. It is logical the refore that the vil¬ lage too should reappear. • IV What do the Bajaws get from the land? Pandan for their mats, kamoteng kahoy for their staple food, and logs for the boats they build. No one can possibly live solely on the sea. One must eat carbohydrates and build shelter. One must wear clothes, and cloth used to be woven from land plant fibers. The viands of the Bajaws come from the sea: shellfish, sea cucumber, seaweed, sea urchins, fish. Their staple food, however, is kamoteng kahoy which, like our rice, has different names for its dif¬ ferent forms. Raw kamoteng kahoy is called kamanting; when grated and water is squeezed out, one has panggi kayu. Panggi kayu can be boiled to produce tibuk billa. This can be pounded with grated coconut into posak, which is then dipped in sugar. When panggi kayu is made into sinangag by dry frying, tumpek is produced. This is equivalent to our kanin. When steamed it is putu, and when made into a suman it is bamban. The linguistic elaborations for the different stages of cassava at test to the centrality of this root crop in their food world. Certainly it is their staple. Their staple viand is fish, which they call daing. What is fish to them is to us salted and dried. Their daing can be roasted over firb, and they use a term which Ilokanos also use: tinunu. They have a term for prito, landang landa, and what is daing to us is dingtoho or pongdang to thefn.

While there are occasional additions to this daily fare of tumpek and daing, such as gabi (jkari), langka (nangka ), saging. (also saging to The Bajaws of Tungkalang 113 them) and sili (lara), their fish is in variably cooked (and they eat only fresh fish) by boiling in water with leaves of sulasi, a plant akin to verbena. This is the only potted plant, or in deed the only plant, which can be found in a Bajaw house. The sulasi removes the peculiar taste and smell (lansci) of fish. Bajaws do not add salt; neither do they add spices. Our paksiw gives them headaches. It must be the ginger, they said. Our sinigang is to lerable. But one day I cooked to myam for them, and of course this Thai sinigang needed tanglad, sili and luya. It made them sick for one whole day. While they are acquainted with dilaw and tanglad, putting spices to gether in one dish (they use no garlic or pepper) is simply too much. Their food has the simplicity of good, basic, honest, down-to-earth, day-to-day Ilokano peasant fare — except that the latter eat a lot of vegetables, which are absent from the Bajaw diet. Both, however, exhibit a respect for the basic in tegrity of the food material. Spices have a transformative effect since they change the basic flavor of food. While we think of spices as enriching the taste of food, the Ilokanos and the Bajaws regard the in nate, or iginal taste of food as riches itself. To transform food is to lose that richness. Transformation is violation of or iginal in tegrity. It sickens the Bajaws. • V The Bajaws do not have words for breakfast, lunch, dinner. But of course they have a word for \"to eat,\" mangan. This nteans that they do not ‘have, specific times for eating. Agahan, tanghalian and hapunan correspond to the specific segment of the day when we eat. There is no word for eating at night or \"gabihan\" because in the daily agricultural cycle the last meal is traditionally in the late afternoon before it becomes gabi. The Bajaws eat when there is food and/or when they are hungry. This could be any time of the day or night. And the in terval between meals could be just two hours. The determinant of their eating is not the time of day. Time does not dictate their meal schedule. Time is not divided into segments during which the Bajaws are supposed to do something. They are focused on what they are doing, i. e. boat-building, fishing, mat weav¬ ing, gathering cassava. Eating becomes only a minor activity. Thus their food world is monotonous. There need not be any adventures in this part of their day. Invariably they eat only tumpek and fish that has been boiled in water and sulasi, This fish broth they call nilohoan, which is derived from the root word loho, meaning sabaw. \"Luho\" to us, of course, means luxury. It could also be that they really in gest only a very limited number of land products, and in deed what can one do with cassava and fish? In how many ways can one combine these staples of their diet? Neither do 114 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food they buy food, so tradition and economic conditions have conspired to make their culinary world monotonous. To them the most delicious food is dolphin, that which we call lumba-lumba and they ubbong. They slice it into small cubes and simply boil it. It tastes like pork, and when a little of the blood is somehow in cluded, then it is like dinuguan. When a Bajaw catches a dolphin, he shares it with as many relatives as possible, even with those who do not reside in his moorage. A large part of the value lies in its rarity.

VI The language of the Bajaws, Sama, which they share with Samas who live on land, the Sama Lea, furnishes clues about an in digenous word which is crucial to an understanding of food distribution: tabu or market. In Waray, tabu refers exclusively to a temporary congregation of sellers and buyers which generally takes place for a few hours in the morning, at dawn or a few hours after sunrise. Usually it is regular, e. g. every Wednesday morning. The goods sold could be only local produce and/or those not produced locally such as clothes, matches, to othpaste, which are brought in by sellers from outside the locality. The tabu is the traditional weekly market in, say, the agricul¬ tural barrios of Western Samar. However, as a temporary structure it can be seen daily in the loading-unloading area of the port of Catbalogan. It is in fact a component in our food distribution system: in our talipapa, in the fleeting coming to gether of itinerant vendors during the busiest hours of a palengke or even around a church, in the weekly tiendas which continue to take place in almost all the to wns and big barrios all over the islands. There is hardly any Sama vocabulary derived from Spanish since the cultural contact was minimal. To the Samas tabu is a market, be it talipapa or palengke,. or a weekly tienda. It existed before the dif¬ ferentiations in food distribution took place. To make purchases in such a place is nabu. The assonantal change is similar to what takes place in taga (slash with, say, a bolo) becoming in the past tense, nanaga. The past tense in Sama for marketing is bay-nabu, bay being a prefix which in dicates past action. However, if one makes a purchase at the corner sari-sari store, it is not nabu, but rather mille (bili in Tagalog). Nabu is to buy in a tabu. Bongao exhibits the characteristics of a frontier town. One main street connects the pier to the town hall. There is no planning so the stores on the main street are randomly disposed. For in stance, right next to a restaurant is a motor repair shop. On a busy smaller street connecting the main road to the pier a jewelry store jostles a shop which sells only green parrots, and a sari-sari store. The Bongao market is a permanent structure. Around it are The Bajaws of Tungkalang 115 eateries and variety stores; in side are specified areas for clothes and vegetables. Where are the sea products sold? In the loading-unloading section of the pier. Sa daungan. Here Bajaw women sell sea urchins, sea shells, seaweeds and fish. Inside the market is a specified area for fish, where one finds the biggest tuna and the biggest lapu-lapu. Because of the nature of the product, the fish tabu outside and the fish section in side the market are open for only a few hours in the morning and in the afternoon. The bustling hours are timed for the return of the fishing vessels. One makes the best purchases of sea products in the morning. Now, one goes to the nearby store to mille candy, soft drinks, cigarettes, and one goes to a tabu to nabu mainly food, which is in variably fish. Fish does not keep. This product dictates the need for buyers and sellers to come to gether at specified hours of the day. Even to day the Samas eat mostly fish. Tabu and nabu have extended their meanings to any product and purchase related to a market. In small villages, how¬ ever, going to market still means the purchase of fish, and this implies all the characteristics of a non-Sama tabu as well. In Bajaw life, the refore, environment, economic conditions and minimal contact have shaped a food of little variety and range, and elemental marketing arrangements.

Out front, Filipino children held about twenty colored banners, flag-looking swaths of cloth. Then came the mourning Chinese in black — even the men wore black. Behind them was the funeral hearse. The Chinese here, it seems, do employ Filipinos not only to tend their. stores but also to flaunt their social status. And the Chinese are not only into economic activities, but now into politics as well. Corazon Cojuangco Aquino is not exceptional. In the slums, of course, there are only Fili¬ pinos. The town exhibits the characteristics of a newly-burgeoning con¬ glomeration of small businesses and an in creasing population. It is a place which has just passed the frontier stage. Pedicabs and motorized tricycles abound. The foot-pedalled tricycles are for transport within the town; the motor-driven ones accommodate at least six passengers while the for mer take only two, and travel longer distances. Right on the street, men have their hair cut, although in the commercial center there are barber shops. In the restaurants customers drink San Miguel beer; at streetcorners under makeshift stalls only tuba and gin are available. The middle class souse the mselves in Chinese restaurants, the masses at street corners. At nine the stores close. The town, like many other Third World to wns, is poorly lit. The \"stand-by's\" take over the place then, walking the streets and having gin and barbecued squid. Days are short. Perhaps there is not much work. Perhaps this is one way the petty capitalists keep the poor, poor. Give them limited work, limited sala¬ ries. Profits can be in vested in. other undertakings. Catbalogan sea resources at test to the richness of nature in the country. Nothing is wrong with our natural resources; it is the in iquities of the unjust socio¬ economic structure which engender poverty — not the fish, but the petty capitalists, spawn slums. Catbalogan used to be the capital of Samar province; now it is the capital only of Western Samar. The one-island province was divided into three. Eastern Samar and Northern Samar being the new ones. The old government structures are the kapitolyo, which is a modern edifice, and the courts; the town plaza as well as the town hall looks new. I think the town plaza was built on a part of the kapitolyo ground. The church appears to have been renovated. The buildings at test to new emergent arrangements. The restau¬ rants, which are on the ground floors of hotels (Tony's, Sunburst, For¬ tune) are all Chinese-owned. So are the hardware stores the trucking services, bakeries (with names the Chinese like, e. g. Ideal), rice stores and the many big sari-sari stores. Malay Filipinos own all the small eateries — three to five tables *— which are carinderias. All the mar¬ ket stalls in the old building are also owned by Malay Filipinos. Obviously those enterprises which require more capital are run by Tabu in Samar 119 i Chinese, and those which need small outlays are owned by Filipinos. A list of the of ficers and members of the Rotary Club shows that the Chinese have also made in roads into the professions and politics. Well, the for mer head of the National Food Authority is Emil Ong, a Samareno. The triangle for med by the kapitolyo (seat of government)^ the church (center of religious power) and the pier (area of commercial power) shows the. distribution of power in this town. The Catbalogan town hall is new; the kapitolyo was erected in 1930. The town hall is in the middle of this triangle, in side, enclosed, and not a corner of the triangle. The triangle itself is a new arrangement, of American vintage. A Spanish town is built on the pattern of church and municipio sepa¬ rated by a town plaza. The market building is an American-in troduced in novation. There used to be only tabu and tiangge, which traditionally took place in the town plaza. The need for a market arose only during the American colonial period"

Well, the for mer head of the National Food Authority is Emil Ong, a Samareno. The triangle for med by the kapitolyo (seat of government)^ the church (center of religious power) and the pier (area of commercial power) shows the. distribution of power in this town. The Catbalogan town hall is new; the kapitolyo was erected in 1930. The town hall is in the middle of this triangle, in side, enclosed, and not a corner of the triangle. The triangle itself is a new arrangement, of American vintage. A Spanish town is built on the pattern of church and municipio sepa¬ rated by a town plaza. The market building is an American-in troduced in novation. There used to be only tabu and tiangge, which traditionally took place in the town plaza. The need for a market arose only during the American colonial period. Before that, households must have been self-sufficient. A middleclass surplus economy ^merged only during the American period. Job specialization, regular salary, emergence. of a petit-bour¬ geoisie — all these took place as a \"class\" emergence only very re¬ cently. % Catbalogan is a new town. It is surrounded by mountains, the in land part of a cove. Vigan in Ilocos Sur is a port town too, like Cat¬ balogan, but the town architecture is very different. There is a section in Vigan for the bahay na bato, the residences of the moneyed, landed rich. Catbalogan, in contrast, is more democratic in that sense. There is no zone for the affluent. The main street traverses the distance between the pier and the kapitolyo. However, the commercial center proper is the market. I saw my second tabu to day at 6:00 a. m.; it was in the pier area, set up for the day of course, not a regular, established market within an edifice. • / The agricultural products were in two places and consisted of root crops, saba, firewood and kalamansi. There were not as many products as there had been in Catalina, Western Samar, where I had seen my first tabu. The sea products were fresher and more numerous: stingray, eel, shrimps, various kinds and sizes of fish, squid. Two squid as big as my palm cost only PI 5. Stingrays as large as my spread hands also cost P 15: Middlemen obviously abounded. In two huts boxes of fishes were being sold wholesale. Those sold around the roofed stalls were in little piles — tumpok-tumpok, P 5 to P 15 isang tumpok. The tabu proper was only for root crops and sea products. since the stalls sold vegetables, ready-to-eat food, condiments. This must be a small market, at which ' the fishermen buy salt, pepper, matches. 120 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food vinegar, etc. with out needing to go to the bigger town market. The stores which line both sides of the street sell rubber slippers, shoes, bakery items and fishing equipment such as nets. There is more elaboration of this style of store in the street just before the old market. On both sides are stores which sell only ready-to-wear items, shoes, kaldero and stoves, and a few which sell sundry goods. The tabu was alive; it was in fact bustling. I walked to the town market. There were hardly any buyers. The only part of the market that had any activity was the meat section. There were pigs with legs tied up, which could probably be but chered on or der right there. After the tabu closes the commerce changes locale — the palengke takes over. Catbalogan, like its markets, is in transition. Victoria, Tarlac, my hometown, has completely lost its tiangge or tabu. In exchange, it now has a very sturdy-looking public market. Of course on Saturday mornings the block around the market, just outside the market wire- mesh walls, is filled with chickens, pigs, agricultural products for sale. The tiangge and the palengke have become one. Eventually the tiangge will be absorbed by the palengke. In the meantime there has been a proliferation of sari-sari stores in the barrios. The pier is really a mix of the Catalina tabu and the Catbalogan market. The tabu portion is open every day from 5:30 to 10 a. m. The fixed structures, surrounded by makeshift stalls or sacks spread on the ground, sell their goods the whole day. No meat is sold. Only agri¬ cultural and sea products. The fixed-structure stores cater also to tra¬ vellers who take the regular Sulpicio and William Lines, as well as to the employees of the cargo boats.

Cata¬ lina, Jiabong, Western Samar, for the regular Saturday morning. There were two groups of sellers: those who brought their own products (two paddles, honey, lupak, suman, gabi, niyog, pinipig, upland rice, banig, batwan, lumber — they cut the trees the mselves and plane the wood into 2 x 2 and 2 x 3 sizes — saba, chico, uway, fresh chickens); and those who came to sell what they the mselves had bought (ice drop, fresh fish, squid, dried fish, to othpaste, laundry soap, fancy earrings, oil lamps made from medicine bottles, clothes — one seller even had a portable microphone — salt, sugar, garlic, cookipg pots, matches, to¬ bacco leaves). The latter were more pushy, more noisy, while the for mer would not say anything unless asked. Barefoot farmers counted their change to buy necessities; matches and salt were selling briskly. A young farmer was engrossed in savoring his ice drop, a real treat. Those with more money or those who had sold their produce tended to ward the ready- to-wear. This morning market takes place in Sta. Catalina every Saturday i Tabu in Samar 121 and provides a rudimentary place for the exchange of goods. The tran¬ saction is mostly in cash. When the tabu is about to end, however, the fish vendors barter their fresh goods for less perishable gabi, rice, saba, pinipig, which they can sell in the town market. I did not see anyone buy to othpaste or bath soap, which are luxury items. One pegs one's desires to the necessities although children are allowed an ice-drop. The tabu expands the horizon of the farmer who lives in the mountains; it becomes part of his social life. The professional sellers, of course, regard him as easy prey. Matches, soap, earrings, salt and sugar are sold in the five roofed stalls. On the feeder road and part of the left side of the highway are the farmers' products. Except for the clothes, this was obviously the farmers area. The roofed stalls are on a promontory about four meters above the level of the highway. Beside it one could choose a space, spread out his goods or put a makeshift stall. This area is for the petty merchants. Sta. Catalina collects P 0.50 from each vendor; however, the itinerant honey (with the honeycomb in a basket), batwan and chicken vendors are not taxed. The lumber producers violate the law against cutting down for est trees. If they bring their lumber to town they can be apprehended and fined. Those who buy them cannot be fined since they did not cut down any for est tree. Those who bring lumber to the tabu actually bring only as much as they can carry since they carry them for 15-20 kilometers. Tabu provides necessities at cheaper prices. For the farmers especially, this of fers an advantage since they don't have to go to town to procure their basic necessities. The tabu is the most rudimentary of Philippine markets. It used to be held on river banks and then at roadsides accessible to sellers and buyers, as in Sta. Catalina. Tabu became in stitutionalized in to wns — one day, mostly morning, in a fixed space, usually the town plaza. The fixing of the day and place made it easier for the participants to converge. Market day, even to day, is observed. That is, although a town market is open during the whole week, each town has a desig¬ nated special market day when agricultural produce and petty mer¬ chandise come to gether. The in crease of middlemen and the specialization of the pur¬ chasing system killed such in stitutions as the tabu, leaving only the \"in stitutionalized\" market day. This is a sign of the urbanization of an area. Now we have only what the producers decide to distribute in the usual market outlets — stores and supermarkets. In the tabu the farmer is also the direct seller and sees his products reach their consumer. It is the simplest of transactions, in volving no middlemen, no structures, other than that of a weekly meeting day.

ENA >. % % Thoughts on Tabu: Market Evanescent E VERY morning from five to seven, the streets around the market in Bankerohan, Davao City teem with agricultural and sea products, as well as a variety of personal and household goods such as firewood, plastic basins, Japanese slippers. The petty sellers peddle coconut, on ions, garlic, gabi, kangkong, pechay, ginger, carrots, eggplant, lanzones, mangosteen, crabs, seaweed, shrimps, fresh fish, dried fish, different kinds of bagoong. Most are in small pile (tumpok ), except for dried fish and fruit, which are sold by weight. Firewood and kangkong are in bundles, Japanese slippers in pairs of course; clothes are limited to shorts and T-shirts. The capital in volved ranges from transportation fare for a farm woman whose gabi still has soil clinging to the tubers, to a few hun- Thoughts on Tabu: Market Evanescent 125 dreds of pesos for the dried-fish vendor who has boxes of them beside her. A few Muslims sell fruit and Zamboanga barter goods, or Maxam soap and Maxam to othpaste. There are two enterprising medicine ped¬ dlers, each selling from his open at tache case and advertising his wares — from a microphone operated by a car battery. The noisiest of the sellers, they receive the most at tention as they vend medicines pack- aged in Manila paper and white plastic. They punctuate their come-on by saying that there are only seven bottles of White Flower left for the first comers. Fish is sold by the kilo, the bigger ones cleaned and cut up right on the street. Only the palanggana peddler is mobile. The function of this tabu, or transient market, is to supply goods at a low price. The same goods are believed by Davawenos to become more expensive after 7 a. m. since at that time the tabu disappears after prodding from the police in khaki uniforms and soldiers in dark green outfits. Just to be sure that the message is understood, they are fully armed — the policeman with a pistol, the soldier with an armalite. Buyers then have to go in side the market, where vendors rent perma¬ nent stalls. In the tabu one displays one's wares on a sack, or pieces of newspaper, a pushcart or in verted boxes. Besides lower cost, the tabu provides fresh goods which can easily be the source of gourmet cooking. As early as 6 a. m. housewives are heading home with baskets brimming with fresh vegetables, fish and fruit. Not only food is sold, however. The morning tabu also becomes the site for buying dry goods and even to iletries at low prices. There is an evening tabu as well. This is along Bolton Street, where jeeps and small buses ferry of fice workers and students back to their homes in the suburbs. Here a more limited range of goods is sold — only fish and vegetables. The morning tabu is definitely a more exciting affair. Since vegetables are gathered early in the morning, those sold at the evening tabu are not as fresh.

II The morning tabu of Davao provides a model for the early-to-rise enterprising Filipino spirit. After the streets where it takes place are swept clean, and the drug peddlers' electronic persuasion is silenced, some of the peddlers, such as the seafood vendors, move to the market. 126 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food There they sit or stand before their basins or baskets of fresh food and wait for the next group of buyers, the maids and wives who could not make it to the early morning tabu. The dried fish vendors move to a different place or into the market, where they have stalls. The fruit vendors transfer to the street corners of the main thoroughfares. They must dispose of their goods in or der to buy a fresh supply for the following day's early morning tabu. Inside the market are sold meat and condiments (patis^ toyo, suka, peppercorns), cooked food, and the not-immediately-perishable like rice, spaghetti, macaroni, noodles, canned goods, bottled goods, clothes, shoes, cigarettes, matches, electronic goods, batteries, even car parts. Let us go back slowly to give tabu a time perspective. In Western Samar, the morning tabu demonstrates the characteristics of this system of market distribution. In the small barangay of Sta. Catalina (in Jia- bong) there was a predominance of products from field and for est brought by farmers. Traders from the town in turn sold the farmers what they could not produce the mselves: ice drop, salt, sugar, matches, clothes, slippers. Tabu must have started as barter trade on some river- banks, or where roads for ked, and was transformed into cash transac¬ tions with the appearance of petty middlemen who needed cash to keep their smalltime businesses going. The tabu can be found on the Catbalogan pier or in a street proximate to the Catbalogan public market. Unlike in Sta. Catalina, where tabu is held only every Saturday morning, it is held daily both in Catbalogan and in Davao City. It continues to exist even in the urban Nepa-Q-Mart: in the overpass, on the sidewalk between EDSA and the market proper, as well as in the talipapa close by. It is an adjunct mar¬ ket, where everything is on tingi scale. Going to market would be so boring with out these evanescent mar¬ kets. Markets with permanent stalls or ganize both buyer and seller by zoning the goods. One knows where to get what. In a supermarket time is frozen; one always finds the same items in the same places. Items are stacked as in a frieze. Space is or ganized, goods are or ganized, people are or ganized. One is not expected to linger; there is a list of items which must be replaced, or goods which must be added. In contrast, going to a tabu is meeting the unexpected. One estab¬ lishes contact with the contemporary unknown. Who knows what one might find, out of season, out of memory? Two handmade paddles? Honey in the comb? A stingray? One expects to be surprised. Squid so cheap. Gabi for almost nothing. And lupak which, is available nowhere else. Space is unorganized, and, the more unorganized it is the older the tabu must be. In Sta. Catalina, the medicine bottles recycled into oil lamps were sold next to the river fish, and the ready-to-wear clothes right next to the suman, and next to that the uway, then the on ions, all Thoughts on Tabu: Market Evanescent 127 in pell-mell fashion. However, across the street on a raised portion were stalls for bare household needs (matches, sugar, salt) and for fish.

Domingo Church is basically a tabu. Goods do not determine the type of market; the kind of market depends on the length and occurrence of the selling. Tabu happens in early morning or early evening, in a roofed structure or in the open. This is called tiangge in Luzon — the one special market day of the week for a town or barrio, which could have a palengke proper. During tiangget goods are cheaper and more varied. Vendors from out of town come on this day to sell their wares. In Morato Street in Quezon City, an urban version takes place on Sundays. Tabu in the rural setting takes place one day of the week; in the urban, every day. In Manila and environs, when there are fixed structures where selling principally takes place a few hours every morning and evening, it is called talipapa. The palengke or mercado is a. definite place with a roofed building and stalls open all day every¬ day. The talipapa is a miniature palengke but before them both came tabu and tiangge. The distribution system or the marketing of goods has two faces and manifests two phases. Somewhere close to a palengke or supermarket is a tabu remnant which tenaciously clings to life, refusing to die even in Rustan's Makati or Cubao. This consists of the one-item specialty stores or conces¬ sionaires selling hotdog, siopaof fruit juice — - just as a vendor sells only one product in Sta. Catalina, Bankerohan, Sto. Domingo, Nepa-Q-Mart or Morato. The tabu has little or no overhead. Goods can be priced much cheaper, the refore, for one does not pay for stalls, electricity, water, salesperson. Tabu lingers even in side the palengke — those itine- rant children who peddle only one item (plastic bag, salt, kalamansi). In front of any middle class supermarket (the Queen's chain, for in stance), there are the ubiquitous sweepstake or peanut peddlers. Then the immobile specialty food stores which of fer cakes, kakanin, goto, hamburger. In front of big markets are stand-up/sit-down stalls beside the on-the-bilao or on-the-sack peddlers. 128 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food III Tabu has two faces: the more dominant rural and the less numerous urban. Two types of goods are on sale: agricultural and non-agricultural. Tiangge in the metropolitan setting sells very few food-related objects (mostly clothes). In the to wns, however, they are still like tabu in that this is the one day of the week that agricultural products are brought to town — to the mass of buyers who will be in the market. During the tabu the rural and the urban are co-terminous, coexist with out tension, are reconciled briefly. During those few hours the tabu truly reflects the economic state and natural bounty of the place. Na¬ ture is transformed into sandwich buns and fruit juices in Morato. In Sta. Catalina the reddish upland rice is produced by pounding with pestle in mortar, honey is raw and unprocessed, and lumber is not kiln-dried. For us who live in the city, going to an early morning market is exciting: goods are fresher and cheaper, and there could be surprises. We have recently emerged from the barter phase into the petty cash market we call tabu, and our racial memory of for est and plains is kept alive by the peripheral vendors and the child peddlers who in nocently rove the heart of public markets. During the tabu the coyness of the rural folk and the loquacity of the to wnsman meet. The farmers are quiet while the small-town ped¬ dlers in veigle the farmers with bullhorns and microphones. The tradi¬ tion al and the modern are situated side by side, competing for small gains. The farmer sells a basic necessity, food, while the to wns- man peddles items not as necessary as food — medicine, clothes. The scale of the tabu is the scale of our economy — small. The phase of our economy is manifested by the most numerous products — agricultural, in cluding fish and other marine products.

Tabu facilitates the distribution of goods: agricultural products among farmers and fishermen and the few customers from the middle class, a few basic necessities, a few luxury items, all tingi, all prices brought down to within reach of the basic masses, all food products fresh. This is the rudimentary distribution system of a truly third- world economy like ours. And even in posh supermarkets somehow the tabu, the system, survives. This is what the tabu finally tells us about ourselves: in us the for est and plains and the town exist not in opposition but in a reconciled quiet; the in digenous and the for eign do not clash; and the latter is in digenized. Containing both, we are vibrant and happy. There is more of the old, but there is an emerging into the new. In all tabu there are modern objects, and though these are few, there is no discomfort with Thoughts on Tabu: Market Evanescent 129 Japanese rubber slippers and cheap RTW. The raucous megaphones do not disturb; their voice becomes the background of the more enveloping, quiet ways of the farmer. They are the meretricious stabs in the otherwise staid peasant life — like an ice drop in the sultry summer. The tabu in the remote areas are weekly fairs — a little com¬ merce, a bit of gossip, an in troduction into the new. In the to wns they connect the sea and the mountains, the peasant and the to wnsman — and connect them now, a now daily renewed, more contemporaneous then contemporary, the evanescent clasp of the basic: the basic products of water and land and the basic needs of man. In tabu nothing is stacked, kept in showcases and piled in one place for long. The tabu disappears after a few hours. And there is only memory of what was there — two paddles on the roadside, honey in its comb, a greenish-yellow stingray wide as two palms, a young barefoot peasant ecstatic over an ice drop on a stick. And there is the next tabu to look for ward to — to morrow, or this morning next week. Tabu is the now that is renewable, the slowly changing in a seemingly unchanging matrix. Tabu is yesterday, more of yesterday, to morrow, a little of to morrow — now. ENA Tiangge, Talipapa, Palengke VERY Sunday morning there is a bustling scene across the Sto. Domingo Church on Quezon Avenue, the huge Dominican church where Ninoy Aquino was laid in state. On the sidewalk are a motley of goods: daing na lapu-lapu, tinapa, vegetables in season, peanut but ter in green, yellow and red plastic containers shaped like Aladdin lamps, fruit in season, abaca and Japanese' slip¬ pers, cheap children's wear. After noon, all — stalls, sellers and goods — disappear. Obviously the target buyers are the churchgoers, thus the mini¬ market's disappearance after the morning's last mass. The vendors are located on the side where the jeeps bound for Projects 2, 3, 6 and 8, and Fairview pick up passengers. Sto. Domingo Church being the biggest 132 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food that side of Quezon City, all its masses are well at tended. Those who go to Quiapo will not buy daing na lapu-lapu, but those bound for home just might. The time that these after-church buyers have is very little since the children in tow keep nudging the adults to go home when there are relatively empty jeeps bound for their destinations. Is this a talipapa? No. For one, the array of goods on sale is in adequate for the needs of the kitchen. Fresh fish, meat or rice are not available; nor is it open every day.

In Victoria, Tarlac where I grew up, tiangge was held every Saturday in the town plaza. Farmers in their carts came to town as a family on Friday night or very early Saturday morning. Other to wns had different tiangge days, so that itinerant ven¬ dors were busy the whole week, moving from one town to the next. These markets sold, as well, goods which were not produced by farmers, like ready-to-wear clothes, aluminum containers and slippers. In the 1970 s, the present town market building was constructed on the site of the old market. It is now a roofed structure divided into stalls that are rented out by the municipal government. The tiangge in the town plaza disappeared, but Saturday is still market day, and farmers still bring their produce to the palengke, and out-of-town vendors still come to Victoria on that day. In Silay, Negros Occidental, now a city and with a modern mar¬ ket, \"market day\" is still Saturday, and the streets are closed to vehicular traffic for the occasion. To it come sellers of pinakas (daing) and binuro (extra-salted fish covered with rock salt) from Bantayan Island; farmers peddling their bananas, papayas, gabi and malunggayi housewives with aratiles and kulitis from their backyard gardens. Vendors from other to wns come too, like Tiya Conching, a 73-year-old widow who told us that she had been selling children's T-shirts and shorts. on market days ever since she was widowed in her thirties. Now, after decades of experience, she could get her goods on credit from a relative and pay back on the same day, with out needing or using money-lenders. The church is closely related to markets. There are, in fact, to wns where the market is right next to the church, such as Marilao, Bulacan and Bolinao, Pangasinan. Tiangge is a good occasion to go to church, especially for farmers who really do not or cannot go to church every Tiangge, Talipapa, Palengke 133 Sunday. The church has also been a social center for many since Catholicism has been so secularized that going to church is of ten more a matter of custom than. an exercise of religious commitment. When churchgoing became a part of social custom, it was no longer blasphe¬ mous to think of going to market when one went to church. A market close to the church is convenient for the mass-goer, and profitable to the stall vendor. Churches have a readymade clientele who function also as food- buyers. That is why, besides sweepstakes ticket peddlers and candle sellers, food vendors can always be found in front of churches, parti¬ cularly on Sunday mornings. Where there is a mass, there will be peo¬ ple, who perhaps would be in terested in buying some things (\"pasa- lubong kay Totoy,\" cry the vendors, or \"aginaldo sa in aanak\" when there's a baptism or confirmation). Where the market is very close to the church, the hours that it is open hew closely to mass hours. During slack hours, both church and market are closed. Some churches have acquired the reputation of having specialty shops which sell products particular to that church vicinity. Quiapo is famous for its herbal stores and anting-anting; Baclaran for its lechon and cheap RTW; and Antipolo for its kasuy nuts and suman. To gain that reputation, the church should develop a cult practice for a parti¬ cular day of the week. Thus on Fridays Quiapo is crowded, and on Wednesdays Baclaran's Redemptorist Church is jammed. Baclaran was not always what it is now. In the 1950 s, the Pasay portion of what was then Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard) was famous for its chicken and pork barbecue stalls. In the beginning, even girls in pedal pushers (trousers reaching to a few in ches below the knee) visited the area. One went there for a barbecue snack and a view of Manila Bay. However, it eventually became a drinking plaza, and the stabbings which occurred there found their way into the dailies. Thereupon, the crowd, sans barbecue, went back to Luneta to view the sunset.

Baclaran used to be really crowded only on Wednesdays, and it was just a Sto. Domingo -daing-na-lapu-lapu type tiangge. Lechon stores soon proliferated, however. In northern Metro Manila, lechon-on-a- pole could be seen close to the La Loma cockpit; in southern Metro Manila, its equivalent came to be Baclaran — rows of stalls of fering whole pigs, pig heads and trotters for paksiw, laman by the kilo or by the guhit, or ders accepted and delivered. More restaurants sprouted, then clothing stores (cheap dusters, lingerie, children's wear). Reli¬ gious objects, in cluding anting-anting and herbal medicines, came to be permanent of ferings. Sellers now of fer plants as well, and a complete 134 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food variety of food. Eventually churchgoers came in droves not only on Wednesdays, but also on Sundays, and serious shoppers on weekdays as well. Finally they visited Baclaran to pray for help — and shop — on any day. The cult has\" found its niche in our religious customs, and the full-blown market has taken its place among Manila's more notable. The \"Bacla¬ ran duster\" is a genre by itself, and the market has even earned a sobriquet \"Barclays,\" just as Divisoria is \"Rue de la Div.\" Unless Sto. Domingo develops a cult, its market will continue to be only a Sunday tiangge. The tiangge is thus an affair of a few hours, usually during one morning of a fixed day of the week. Of even shorter duration, no more than three hours, is the tabu of Samar, Iligan and Bicol. This takes place from dawn to 7 a. m., and again or iginally in a place (a riverbank, a crossroads; later a lot near the center of town or a comer of the plaza) accessible to farmers and fishermen. The talipapa evolves when there is a critical mass in the area which purchases food daily, and when fresh food items can be sold also on a daily basis. The talipapa, how¬ ever, consists of temporary stalls or papag, or even just pails and bilao or sacks spread on the ground. They can be found only a few, hours each day, usually briefly in the morning and then again in the evening. In Manila there are traditional ones on Pepin Street and Basilio Street, close to the Dapitan crossing. They have been there for decades and have not evolved into a palengke because these talipapa are on the street itself, with out place to expand. On the way to Escopa from White Plains, there is a talipapa that sprouts up every morning — a line of bilao and pails servicing the area's immediate food needs. As in old talipapa, what one needs for the day's needs can be bought in one area. Cash and goods are limited, and when one has more cash one goes to the Quiapo market for one's food purchases. The talipapa in the provinces emerge when there is a daily delivery of fresh food, and enough buyers to make selling profitable away from the fixed market. There is one in Paombong, Bulacan and another close to barrio Sagrada Familia, Hagonoy, Bulacan. They are open only in the late afternoons, and the fresh food consists of the catch from the river and from Manila Bay. In contrast, a palengke is open the whole day, meaning that there is a permanent structure where goods are displayed in stalls or stores. Here, there are definitely more peo¬ ple, more cash to spend, and so more goods on sale. The daing na lapu-lapu sold across Sto. Domingo Church on Sun¬ day mornings comes from Legaspi City.

ENA < The Anatomy of a Philippine Market HE Nepa-Q-Mart in Quezon City, as archetype of the Philippine market, presents a configuration designed by the dynamic relationship of buyers and sellers. The buyers are constantly on the move. The sellers are either in a given fixed space or are ambulant. The number of people in the market undulates like a huge, slow wave: gradually in creasing from 7 to 9 in the morning, then waning, with another big wave in the late afternoon from 5 to 6:30 p. m. The two waves have a similar structure — a gradual rising and falling slope. The busiest hours in Nepa-Q are completely predictable. The market is never with out people. At night fruit and vegetables are delivered in the wholesale area, and in the early morning the fishmongers and the other vegetable dealers are back early from The Anatomy of a Philippine Market 137 Malabon or Divisoria. Even during slack hours the stalls are kept open, for the Philippine market never sleeps. The parameters of the Nepa Q-Mart are the Mercury Drug Store at one end and the row of small shops along Ermin Garcia Street. These are stores in permanently built structures, which need a large amount of capital. These capital-in tensive stores in clude bakeries (hopia, bread), hardware-electric goods stores, pawn shops, furniture shops, and a drugstore and stationery shop. Although part of the Nepa Q-Mart con¬ figuration, these are not stalls but stores. Stores require higher rent; thus their goods are believed to be more costly. Next in the configuration come stalls, which are designated \"store spaces\" in the market, and of which most of the market is composed. These demand less rent so their goods are believed to cost less. The least expensive goods come from the next step in the configuration: the am¬ bulant peddlers in the market and the surrounding streets, selling vege¬ tables, fruit, fish, salt, plastic bags, ihaw-ihaw. Each ambulant entre¬ preneur's capital in vestment is limited to a bilao or a metal-wooden stand, and the goods he sells. Still another in teresting phenomenon in market structure is the spill-over or spill-out from the actual market area. The eskinita at the comer of Mercury Drug Store, or rather the area around it, is a veritable market — an impermanent one that vanishes each day, to reappear the next. The vendors display their wares on little tables, or on the street At some times, only dried fish can be found here. At other times the whole market repertoire — clothes, vegetables, fish, pork and beef, poultry, rice, coconuts, karihan, fruit and dry goods — is available throughout the hours of its existence. It is the refore another Nepa Q- Mart on a small and transitory scale. How small? There is only one fish stand and one fruit stand while in side the market there are multiples of these. Within the market proper, of course, there is a wider range of choice. This mini-mart, however, has two functions: one buys here when one is in a hurry, or one picks up here what one for got to buy in side on one's way to the waiting jeepneys. There are many rice stalls here, though, since buyers prefer to carry rice only for short distances — i. e. from the street stall to the jeepneys. This mini Q-Mart is essentially a talipapa, the transitional stage between the evanescent early morning market (known as tabu, tiangge, in the Visayas), and the more permanent market we know as palengke. The tabu is a \"market\" that usually sprouts at dawn in any convenienl location — river bank, crossroads, plaza. It is a convergence of sellers whose goods are mostly agricultural and produced by the mselves. By about 6:30 a. m., the market would have dispersed. The tabu still exists in some parts of Samar and Leyte, in Marawi City, in Iloilo, in Bicol. The next step in the evolution of the tabu from its rural beginnings 138 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food was to have a few permanently located landmarks for the market place — e. g. a drugstore or a rice store, and a much larger number of evanescent peddlers. These maglalako are not actually ambulant since they have a fixed space which they occupy regularly in the talipapa area.

Even if they have in stalled semi-permanent structures, their stalls are not open the whole day, but only for a few hours morning and afternoon. The Nepa Q-Mart complex of fers both a talipapa and a palengke — and allows us a glimpse into the evolutionary process. A canal separates the two, and the area bound by this canal and Ermin Garcia Street is the Nepa Q-Mart proper. The palengke is a roofed structure the floor space of which is divided into rental stalls, which are open all through the day and where all the basic culinary and clothing needs are available. A last glimpse at. the mini-mart/ urban talipapa spawned by the giant Nepa Q-Mart shows us that the RTW, fruit and fish stalls (sidewalk vendors, really) are right by the side of Mercury Drug Store, while the vegetable vendors, with their bilao or sako displays of vegetables in bunches (tumpok ) worth PI or P 2, sprawl over the streets, spilling onto the proximate corner. All keep the same hours — only peak market hours. After these hours the vendors vanish, and only the permanent stalls and stores remain. Let us now go in side the market. From the outside it exudes the dank smell of rotting meat. This must be the reason the upper class avoid it although the middle and lower classes frequent it. The upper class want their purchases in aseptic plastic bags. At Nepa Q, one has to buy the plastic bags from the small boys and girls who hawk them, especially around the fish and meat stalls. These children also sell salt, kalamansi, or garlic and black peppercorns tingi, or, for those nearer the EDSA entrance, hairclips and other notions such as thread, garter, but tons and such. These children or teenagers with bilao slung on their necks are mobile and approach prospective customers. They and the housewives, maids and houseboys keep the Nepa Q-Mart and the talipapa outside in constant flux. There is a logic to the manner in which the goods are arranged in Q-Mart. The wet market forms the in ner core — fish, shrimps, chicken, pork, beef — and this is where the main in gredients of dishes are found. One plans meals around what one buys in this area. If there. are fresh, sizable lapu-lapu heads, then one thinks of sinigang or Chinese fish- head stew, and thus moves into the area peripheral to this core area, to buy the vegetables and condiments. Vegetables hardly form a meal by the mselves but are widely and constantly available. In Q-Mart there is a preponderance of Ilocano sellers due probably to the large numbers of Ilocanos in Projects 2 and 3, The Anatomy of a Philippine Market 139 and in this part of Quezon City. One finds here alocon (a curly, elongated tree flower), poppoplo (meaning thighs), or or mot (meaning pubic hair), and ararosip (which look like tiny green. grapes) — varie¬ ties of seaweed for which Ilocanos always feel nostalgia; also different kinds of alamang and alubaybay. The most numerous stalls are those which sell vegetables. This is a distinctive feature of Q-Mart. We in clude here the stalls not only for green and succulent vegetables, but also for products like coconut, langka and gabi. Fruit is available 24 hours a day. Seasonal fruit is cheapest, of course, and is given at lower prices when one buys wholesale. Bana¬ nas are sold by the piece or by the hundred. Corn is also sold in this area (suggesting that we consider it closer to fruit than to vegetable). Rambutan is making a dent in the eating habits of Quezon City residents.

But notice that at the Nepa Q-Mart it is the unchanging core — chicken, pork, beef, fish, the wet market — which subsumes the changes (vegetables and fruit). The structure of Nepa Q-Mart reflects the structure of our food choices and our food preparation. ENA. t The Chinese Connection HEN I was growing up in Silay, Negros Occidental, eating out meant only one thing: Chinese food at Leong's in Bacolod, which seemed like the only panciteria in the world — at least in our small provincial world. Invariably we had nido soup, or soup of shark fins, which my father called by their full name: aletas de tiburon. Then of course one had to have morisqueta to stada, agrio dulce (sweet-sour pork), lumpia Shanghai, piruec frito (fried wonto. n), to rta de cangrejo, maybe a pancit, and camaron rebozado dorado con jamon. Eventually I went to Manila for the last years of high school as in terna. When my father came to town he of course took us out to eat — a big treat. We would go out in our \"Sunday dress,\" a most unglamorous The Chinese Connection 143 and uncomfortable school uniform, long-sleeved, white, pleated, starchy and warm. Our eating-out repertoire expanded to sizzling steaks at the Selecta on Azcarraga Street, which he loved — and Panciteria Moderna, where we had more or less what we had in Bacolod. Staying on for college, graduate school, work and marriage ex¬ panded my experience of Chinese food. It seemed that Panciteria Moderna was not the whole Philippine-Chinese world. There were Panciteria Antigua and Wa Nam (all in the same Sta. Cruz area), the latter so amazingly cheap that we once hired it to serve food at a class party. We wandered into Chinatown and found See Kee, which seemed like Atlantis. It had so many other things besides lumpia Shanghai, sweet-sour pork, fried rice (which we had learned to call \"fly lice\" with a joking, knowledgeable air).

So were the famous pigeons at Smart off the Escolta. This was Chinese food, not comida China. The latter was served at Leong's, or at Mo¬ derna, and was familiar. Comida China was for lunch or dinner in a restaurant, and did not in clude siopao, siomai or mami, which were for merienda. Of course, as a child, siomai to me was only and always Tia Tilde Valencia's little pork-filled morsels that the old lady vendor with the basket on her head brought around town. Even when I found out that it was Chinese in or igin, the taste of siomai still had the stamp of Tia Tilde, now gone, and all later siomai had to measure up to the food of childhood and memory. Kekiam wasn't Chinese either because we were taught how to * cook that in a college cooking course, and we had it at home on or dinary days, my father calling it by an irreverent name referring to its shape and to Chua, a Chinese friend of his. Siopao was what one bought at Ma Mon Luk on rare jaunts out, or at the school canteen when the concessionaire brought in a few. I don't think we stopped to consider it Chinese. And certainly lumpiang ubud and pancit were not, being staples of home cooking. My husband, on the other hand, grew up in Paco, and his child¬ hood was filled with sidewalk cooking and vending — bitsu-bitsu, buchi, ampazv, gurgurya \"na tinitinda ng bakla.\" We did not have those in Silay, and one day we drove all around Paco to satisfy my curiosity about these exotica, but alas, they were all gone. We did stop at the neighborhood panciteria of his boyhood, called Panciteria Santiago, where they still wrapped up a serving of pancit in a cone of paper. 144 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food Travelling to Hong Kong, Taipeh and China in later years, we learned more and more about Chinese food. All those regions, and the vast variety of food! Bears' paws, monkeys' brains (a story to drama¬ tize and exaggerate a bit, at appropriate occasions). Lion's head (a ball of pork). Beggar Chicken, fish maws, sea slugs, fish brain soup, roasted unborn pig, civet cat, hairy Shanghai crab, sheets of bean skin like silk, eel in oil and garlic, fishes vari-shaped and multi-colored, vegetarian noodle dishes with white and black fungus and vegetables in galaxies. Some dishes would jog the memory, however. On a street in China, at breakfast time, at merienda time, hot kawa (woks) would appear, in which were cooking many things that looked familiar — bitsu-bitsu, buchi, gurgurya? Could that be where they had come from? And the Cantonese breakfast lugao with chicken, or fish, or pork. Parang arroz caldol But arroz caldo has a Spanish name! Could it have Chinese or igins? And one day, at breakfast in a restaurant in Hong Kong to which bird fanciers took their pets, hung them up beside one another on poles, and had for the mselves pots of tea and lots of dimsum: dumplings (aha, siomai); stuffed steamed bread (siopao pala); and noodles in broth (umm, mami). Was there a Chinese connection? Was this the Chinese connection?

Sianse is Chinese, and so are to kwa, taho and tahure and any¬ thing coming from soy beans, in cluding toyo. So are many of the pork terms — liempo, kasim — suggesting that the Chinese brought with them the use of many pork cuts and cooking methods. Beef, on the other hand, is called by many Spanish names — lomo, punta y pecho, solo- millo, cadera — in dicating that those usages and recipes came from Spain. Kenchi and kamto are Chinese. So are not only siopao and The Chinese Connection 145 siomai, but also all the noodle names — bihon, miki, miszva, pancit, mami, lomi, sotanghon. And herb and flavoring names like xvansoy, kinchay and kinchamsay (dried banana blossoms). But if names are a key, why then the Spanish names for. comida China? Morisqueta to stada, camaron rebozado, pescado en salsa agrio- dulce, to rta de cangrejo, sopa de nido, pins ec con caldo, aletas de tiburon? Obviously, they came into our restaurants during the Spanish period, when menus were written for the convenience of the diners and not of the chefs. To make the names and the nature of the dishes understandable to the diners (surely predominantly Spanish-speak¬ ing), the Chinese dishes were given Spanish names — which became in stitutionalized as the names of the Chinese food served in pan- citerias from Spanish times on ward. In the American period, when English came to be the language of menus, these names slowly — very slowly — slipped into English, and then later into Tagalog. Some of them remain half in Spanish still; some have had their spelling so corrupted by non-Spanish-speaking restaurant owners, cooks and typesetters, as to be barely discernible. Along and around the Escolta, restaurants with blackboards on stands outside had and still have the menus written in chalk: COMIDA CHINA, they say on top. But the food names are Spanish, English, Tagalog, mestizo. Nido Soup; Wonton Soup; Sweet-Sour Pork; Sharkfin Soup. Fried Rice. Ampalaya con came. Camaron Rebozado (usually Rebosado) still, perhaps because \"Batter-Fried Shrimps\" do not have the same flavor. Nido is convenient — just one word against \"Soup of the Nests of Cliff-nesting Swallows.\" Even Birds' Nest Soup seems wordy. Eventually came menus that said: CHINESE FOOD. Chopsuey with rice. Chicken Chopsuey, Beef with Broccoli, Ampalaya con Came (oops, a holdover), Bihon Guisado. And Halo-Halo, meaning a dish of mixed cold meats — pork, ham, in testines, liver. Suman China. Oyster Cake. Or Torta Talaba. Pato Tim, Pata Tim, Baboy Tim\\ In Binan, Laguna, at a small restaurant called Po Hong, we found a blackboard- menu in which the only Spanish word was \"con,\" the rest being in English and Tagalog. Atay con Gulay. Chopsuey con Hipon. In Lubao, Pampanga, we were delighted to find a menu that listed Camaron Rebosado (the \"z\" dropped long ago) under Philippine Dishes, and Camaron Dorado con Hamon (note the H) among Chinese Dishes. In these menus is hidden the history of the evolution of Chinese food into Filipino-Chinese (equivalently Filipino) food.

Settling here, they adapted these to local in gredients and most probably taught them to their Filipino wives. (Intermarriage and acculturation are features of the successful absorption of Chinese into Philippine society — a success notable in Southeast Asia, where Chinese and native cultures have of ten clashed violently.) The weather, the fruits of nature, the Filipino tastebuds wrought further changes. Chinese food thus entered homes and habits at ground level, so to speak — as the food of everyday, the food of a fellow villager, not a conqueror. It came accompanied by cooking methods and implements, meats and vegetables, occasions and manners — in effect by a whole food culture. We did not \"import\" in dividual dishes, as a housewife might try out a new recipe from a cookbook. We slowly, unconsciously learned to \"eat Chinese.\" When time came to serve Chinese food in restaurants, the names were translated into Spanish, dating their entry into the realm of eating-out food. Now, in the 20 th century, we can recognize Chinese food — by Chinese names and by Spanish names, and also by the English and Tagalog names — in dividually or in combination. Some dishes, like pesa and the accompanying miso, we do not recognize at all. Few realize that these are Chinese in or igin and not native, so thoroughly have they been in digenized, so much a part of our everyday food have they become, so \"sariling atin\" do they seem. No mother considers camaron rebosado and lumpia frito comida China when she prepares them at home. Native they are now. Pancit is food for fiesta, for pasalubong to wives waiting at home, for chil¬ dren's and class parties, for daily fare. Goto is on many a streetcorner — sariling atin by now. Siopao might be a schoolchild's baon; mami his merienda in the school canteen. In a little panciteria in Binan or Lubao, the food is Filipino, having earned citizenship by its long residence and its having learned to speak the language of the Filipino stomach. The Chinese connection in our food, started in the in teraction of trade centuries ago, is now buried deep in our history, in our hearts, and in our tastes. DGF. The Spanish Legacy!%! T is undeniably here, in Philippine life, most notably in the fact that the best Spanish restaurants in Asia are in Manila; most permanently in the fact that Spanish food is so imbedded in our homes and feasts that we barely notice its for eign or igin. When does a Filipino first encounter Spanish-based food? Pro¬ bably in childhood, with such or dinary-day dishes as almondigas (meat balls or bola-hola) or croquetas (croquettes, very of ten chicken, by some called \"cocretas\", the way garbanzos are sometimes called \"gra- banzos\" by the native to ngue). Perhaps a mild soup good for children, like sopa de fideos, or a to rtilla de patatas. Or longaniza (my teacher always called it \"langonisa\" because that was the Batangas term) for The Spanish Legacy 149 breakfast. Or leche flan far dessert. In the homes where these were served, they were not considered particularly special, classy or imported, but part of the home reper¬ to ire. Condimentos Indigenas, for example, is a cookbook compiled by Pura Villanueva Kalaw in 1918, with recipes gathered from relatives and 'friends from Batangas, Iloilo, Ilocos, Sorsogon, Cebu, Pasig and Mindanao. Among such obviously native dishes as Pinakulaw de Hojas de Gabe, Mongo con Puso, Sinudsud and Alupi, are dishes like Cocretas [sic] de Polio, Calamares en su Tinta, Almondigas and Leche Flan Pop¬ ular — obviously daily fare. The author's in troduction says, moreover, that the book was written \"in... times of trial when the prices of imported food have risen beyond the limits of the resources of most families,\" and the refore presents \"platos nacionales,\" which are inex¬ pensive and use native in gredients and condiments. This eficulturation of Spanish dishes is confirmed many years later in the most popular Philippine cookbook of the last four decades, Enriqueta David-Perez's Recipes of the Philippines.

A look at the Everyday Dishes section in the table of contents shows Bacalao a la Viscaina_alongside Bachoy and Bago-ong Guisado; Lengua Estofada cheek-by-jowl with Laksa. and Lang-Lang; Morcon preceding Nangka Salad and Pakam; Sopa de Pan a la Diabla (which calls for chorizo de Bilbao) consorting with Suam, Tinagoctoc and Tinutunqan. Chorizo de Bilbao, too, is an in teresting bit of in digenization. There is no such. chorizo in Bilbao, nor in deed in Spain, as Filipinos who go there have found out. Such sausages used in stews and soups are \"chorizos para cocinar\" of different names and kinds — but not Bilbao. Obviously the sausage had become so thoroughly adopted into the Filipino family that it was given its own name — Spanish, true, but not its \"native\" name in Spain. These \"everyday\" Spanish dishes may be found in middle class family fare, but not usually in lower class and peasant meals, where the habits and the budget almost necessarily dictate native food. Upward on the social scale, however, the food becomes more and more Spanish in tone — pan de sal or pan de limon for breakfast, chocolate and churros in the morning or at merienda time, cookies like lengua de gato and candies like yetnas. It is at fiestas, however, that the Spanish accent becomes even stronger and very discernible. The fiesta table groans with Spanish bounty: lechon, relleno, mechado, morcon, Paella a la Valenciana, etc. It is as though, for the special occasion, the best, the classiest, the most expensive food had to be served — to repay hospitality, to celebrate the saint's feast, to spread goodwill around the neighborhood, to make 150 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food the grand gesture, to \"throw the house out of the window,\" as the Spanish say. All that, one did not do with quotidian food, but with what was once the food of the conqueror, the mark of urbanity and class. Returning to Enriqueta David Perez's Recipes of the Philippines, we note in the table of contents that Fiesta Fare consists of: Atroz a la Catalana, Arroz a la Valenciana, Calder eta, Callos con Garhanzos, Chicken Pork Loaf (which requires chorizo de Bilbao, despite the name). Chicken Relleno, Chicken Pastel, Embutido, Jamon en Duke, Lechon de Leche, Lengua, Lengua Mechada, Morcon, Paella, Pastelitos de Pescado and Pancit Molo. Only the last is not Spanish, being Chinese. Almost with out exception, the refore, fiesta food as conceived here is Spanish. Special feasts, like Christmas, accentuate this even further, revealing the Christian/Spanish or igins: cocido for the media noche family reunion; ensaimadas y chocolate and jamon Pina for the Christ¬ mas day breakfast, alongside the native puto, suman and bibingka. For the partying and visiting of ninongs and relatives, to cino del cielo, turron, membrillo, castillos, borrachos, brazo de Mercedes, to rta de la Reina, buhuelos, capuchinos, suspiros and pastillas, etc. — sweets or iginally brought in from Spain, which soon became the specialties of aunts, mothers, grandmothers, local bakeries. Our repertoire of sweetness seems heavily drawn from the Spanish legacy. When one considers native (non-Spanish) desserts, or panghimagas, they seem to consist mostly of the sweetened rice family (suman, bibingka, puto, kutsinta, palitaw_, etc.), or fruits fresh or sweet¬ ened (minatamis na saging, langka, kaong), or the crushed-ice line of halo-halo, mongo con hielo, etc. Just about all the rest seem to have come from the Spanish kitchen and the elite lifestyle: flan de leche, flan de manzanas, flan de cafe, merengues, mamones con mantequillado, borrachuelos, biscocho de fraile, buhuelos o suspiros de monja, rosquil- las, etc"

Could the national sweet to oth be Hispanic? And could it have taken root in the leisure and lifestyle of the principalia since desserts are not part of peasant food? In the Spanish restaurants of Metro Manila, definitely the best in the Orient, we see another facet of the Hispanic in heritance. For many years, eating out for the Filipino meant going to either a panciteria for comida China, or to a Spanish restaurant. By the 1950 s, the terms of this lexicon were quite set, the favorites elected and enshrined: paella, lengua, callos, gambas, salpicado, sopa de ajo, zarzuela de mariscos, The Spanish Legacy 151 solomillo a la pobre, pescado en salsa verde, bacalao a la Vizcaina, etc. By the 1980 s, the standards remained and are now found in such venerable restaurants as Casa Marcos, Casa Alba, Patio Alba de Ma¬ kati, Mingoy's, El Comedor and Patio Guernica, and in such newer ones as Gasparelli and Ciudad Fernandina. However, some of these are found as well in restaurants of assorted persuasions, e. g. Kalye (which has appetizers from various cuisines); Mario's (which started out as a pizza parlor); Azotea (whose other specialty is Filipino food), Alex III (which has a sushi bar), and Apolinario (with a menu eclectically continental, American and Bicolano). Any restaurant that wants to be assured of a steady clientele seems to put some Spanish dishes on the menu, for in surance — of ten the same dishes, which have become the \"colloquial\" Fil-Spanish gastronomic vocabulary. A few restaurants, like the Nielson Tower, explore the vocabulary more deeply, with such dishes as Sopa de la Reina (chicken necks painstakingly deboned and stuffed, sliced thin and floated in the clear chicken broth) and Ensalada de Toronja y Jicama (a salad of pomelo and singkamas), from recipes dug out of family trunks. In other trunks surely lie keys to other dishes that graced family tables once, but one only hears about now — Sopa Cartuja, Bacalao al Pilpil, Olla Gitana, etc. — and hardly tastes., Unlike Chinese food, which entered at \"street level,\" as the food of traders and tradesmen, Spanish food entered Philippine life at the elite level, being the food of the conqueror. How expensive, how luxurious this food must have seemed to Filipinos bred on rice, vege¬ tables and fish from the surrounding landscape. How heavy and rich it was since beef was so prominently featured — which is why many of our beef cuts (punta y pecho, cadera) still bear Spanish names. How difficult it must have been to assemble in gredients for a paella or a cocido since condiments from Madre Espana came so slowly and so rarely on those fabled galleons. The elite were at first the only ones who could afford Spanish food. My father used to tell us of the awe with which they saw and smelled the rich food of the Padres Agustinos, in whose college he studied, and how they would snitch chorizos and wine. The elite wanted to be like the conqueror, to be urbanized and Hispanized. And so the food came into their lives — at first for special occasions, then for less than special occasions, and finally for everyday and for adapta¬ tion. Interesting transformations occurred. Puchero came to be a stew with saging na saba and an accompanying salad of talong. Arroz a la Valenciana eventually spawned the native bringhe, with coconut milk in stead of olive oil and saffron.

Paella, 152 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food which in Spain started as a dish made in the fields with whatever was available, here was mandated to richness, with meats, fowl, seafood in fiesta abandon. Adobo, which in Spain is a relish with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, or egano, black pepper, salt, gave its name to a dish of pork and/or chicken cooked in oil, vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, black pepper and salt (omitting those not readily available, or not favored by the native to ngue); while adobado, which is a Mexican meat dish, gave its name to the process of marinating/cooking as for adobo. Beneath all these dishes, there are also the methods of cooking learned from Spain, notably sauteeing, or gisa (from the Spanish word guisar or guiso), and frying iprito, from the Spanish frito). Most native dishes are roasted, boiled or steamed (in ihaw, nilaga, pinasingaw / halabos); lard or oil is hardly ever used. Since all cooking in oil is now called by a Spanish name, the or igin of the process seems clear. Even beneath the cooking, there are also the food plants, the vegetables and fruits that were brought in from Spain and Mexico — then called Nueva Espafta. In his book Mexico en Filipinas: Estudio de una transculturacion (1965), Rafael Bernal points out that many words used in the Philippines are Mexican rather than Spanish in or igin. Among them are such food words as: achuete, avocado, cacao, cama- chile, camote, chico, chocolate, panocha, papaya, sayote, sili, sincama [singkamas], casaba, maiz, mani. The Jesuit historian Juan J. Delgado lists in his Historia General (1892) trees and plants found in the Phil¬ ippines and in dicates which of them were or iginally from Mexico. Spanish food has become part of Filipino food culture — a transculturation, as Bernal puts it. We will never be able to think of our culinary culture with out this in fluence and in put. It in forms our days or dinary and special; it flavors our family fare and our feasts. Transformed and transmuted through time, by native in gredients, and by the native taste, it has been in digenized, adapted and adopted as our very own. It is now Filipino. Nick Joaquin has written, enumerating what Christianity (read: Spain) has given the Filipino: \"... now we realize what a lot it has given: from corn to camote, from to matoes to to bacco, from your morning bread the pan de sal to your afternoon shade the ipil-ipil, from the kitchen soap to the latrine, from the pipe or gan to the kanto boy's guitar, from the horse-and-rig to the railroad, and from sopa and ensalada to adobo and guisado, not to ment ion the lechon, the morcon, the menudo, the relleno...\" ' 1 Writing of his Philippine milieu as a writer, he continues: \"I tell my readers that the best compliment they can pay me is to say that they smell adobo and lechon when they read me. I was smelling adobo and lechon when I wrote me.\" We all \"smell adobo and lechon\" and our Spanish heritage when we speak of Filipino food.

There is food on stands outside homes like a housewife's little bilao. of banana-cue outside her home, or a stand of roasted com or bar¬ becue being in dustriously fanned by a little boy (\"in utusan ng nanay\") or a young maid with curlers in her hair. There are quail eggs in rows in plastic, ampaw and bukayo and balut, boiled peanuts and but ong pakwan at jeepney and bus stops; corn nips and salted peanuts outside movie houses. There are chicharron in bags and peanuts in carts outside hospitals. There is food on grills and carts in places where a lot of people pass, like the barbecue stands, day-old chicks and fishball carts of Cubao. And there is food on am¬ bulant carts that are set up in the evenings, e. g. on Aurora Boulevard near EDSA. They come in bringing pots, plates, cutlery, glasses, water for drinking and washing, burners, tables and benches, and set up temporary residence on the sidewalks just for the time when people leave work and move homeward — and stop to eat or buy pasalubong for wife and kids along the way. All these seem to have especially sprouted and blossomed in the recent economic crisis. I remember that when I was in high school and college in the 1950 s, the only place where we could get food outside of permanent eating places (cafeterias, carinderias; restaurants) was the \"barbecue plaza\" on Roxas (Dewey then) Boulevard. There, enter¬ prising sellers set up not only their grills, but also wood-and-cloth folding chairs — all of which disappeared with the dawn, only to reappear at twilight. The only items available there, however, were pork and chicken barbecue (this is where I first heard of marinating barbecue in 7-Up), and only of pork chunks, chicken legs and thighs, and chicken breasts; nothing else. Today, as we know, the barbecue stands of fer every single edible part of the chicken, showing that the economy for bids the rejection or waste of anything edible and in sists that even the lowliest part be made available for the unmonied to buy. Thus there are chicken breasts, iwings, thighs antf legs; chicken backs, chicken necks and chicken feet; also chicken puwit (this a luxurious item, for those who like best \"the part that goes over the fence last\"); chicken gizzards and livers (for merly thrown into the adobo pot and sold separately); and. 156 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food * cheapest of all, to feed the masses, chicken in testines, painstakingly and prettily coiled and strung on small sticks. In Negros, where we have long had a chicken-barbecue tradition called in asal (marinated in tuba vinegar), sold near the marketplaces, we now have a whole area of small manukan stalls called Manukan Country, in which one of the items sold is chicken blood — in chunks, to be dipped into a hot sawsawan. Alongside all these maximally-utilized chickens are of course the standard pork barbecue, barbecued pigs' ears and also in ihaw na pusit. The latter started the whole ihaw-ihaw phenomenon when someone discovered how to tenderize (rub with sugar, says one; marinate in 7- Up, says another) large squid before charcoal-broiling. A whole culture has sprung up around these barbecues, brought about not only by the food and the habit of eating on one's feet (some¬ thing the Filipino usually scorns in the rush-dash American lifestyle), but also by people's pop at titude to them. This unserious at titude, which suggests that the food is not real ulam, but something to be taken on the road, in an emergency, outside the home — pantawid gutom, as Edilberto Alegre has pointed out — is betrayed by the pop names given the food. There are Adidas, PAL, Walkman, Helmet, IUD, Ass; many items change names with the tides of whim and time. Alongside the barbecue stands is one type that results from the burgepning poultry in dustry — the fried day-old chicks"

There are Adidas, PAL, Walkman, Helmet, IUD, Ass; many items change names with the tides of whim and time. Alongside the barbecue stands is one type that results from the burgepning poultry in dustry — the fried day-old chicks. Formerly, the male day-old chicks were rejected by poultry raisers because they were not profitable to grow into fryers, since they didn't fatten as fast as the female chicks. And so they were generally thrown into the sea. Until some Third World, survival-bent, economic-crisis-impelled chef, un¬ happy about such waste, discovered that they could be fried and, because of their age and tenderness, eaten whole as good pulutan. And so the day-old chicks were promoted to street, stall, and even restau¬ rant food. Now they are found in street carts, in small restaurants in EDSA Central, and even in Rudy Siojo's Country Chef, where they are called Super-Chicks. In San Fernando, Pampanga we saw them dyed a brilliant or ange and sold on the sidewalk near Everybody's Cafe — and called \"Day-O.\" Also found on carts near the barbecue areas are fishballs skewered * on sticks, to be deep-fried before selling, then dipped into sauce before eating. Fishball carts also wander or park near schools since they are within the budget and taste of schoolchildren. They have been en¬ shrined in popular lingo by the legend that Assumption girls love to \"make tusok-tusok the fishballs.\" Once and only once I found (on an evening trot through Cubao) a cart at which a Bulakena was selling French-fried balut. These were cracked balut which could not be sold as balut, the juice having dripped out through the crack. She peeled them, rolled them in a light batter. The Streetfood Scene 157 and fried them before her customers, then gave them the egg in a little saucer of vinegar, salt, pepper and chili. They were delicious — but everyone I told about them never found my Bulakena source again. The ambulant vendors are no longer limited to manggang hilaw and suha, but only constrained by imagination and portability. Thus we have the pushcarts selling hot boiled corn, elaborately fitted with in sulated basket, plastic bags, testing forks, and even trash cans for the husks; also those selling boiled peanuts, which surely must go down in history as the food of the EDSA revolution. Waiting for a stoplight at the corner of EDSA and Ortigas, one realizes that there are seasons for ambulant food — a season for boiled bananas, another one for apples and or anges in plastic bags (near Christmas), and all seasons for salted peanuts, but ong pakzvan and quail eggs. The empress dowager of all ambulant food vendors must be the fresh lumpia seller in Divisoria, who carries sauteed vegetable filling, wrappers, condiments and sauce separately, stuffs and rolls the lumpia — all while squatting on the sidewalk, before moving on. And the crown prince must be the night-roaming balut vendor, who can be seen on Roxas Boulevard, in bus terminals, in residential neighborhoods. Mang Cesar, the Pateros balut-maker who explained the whole balut culture to me, says that the lowest quality balut is sold in bus terminals (aged. beyond 17 days \"at matigas na ang bato\") — because there the seller knows that he will never see his customer again. And, impliedly, does not have to feel as if he has betrayed a suki — the suki rela¬ tion ship being a hallowed part of Pinoy tradition. Also in Divisoria used to be the bilao-laden sellers of chicharong bituka and chicharong bulaklak, but they now seem to be permanently parked in supermarkets, where they use stainless-steel carts as proof of their upward mobility. My students tell me that the taho vendors are among the most prosperous of the ambulant vendors. They get their supplies from factories — usually Chinese-owned — and their beats are of ten residential neighborhoods like Greenhills and Dasmarinas, where they have steady customers, suki, who buy regularly and pay promptly. One vendor in Loyola Heights made about P 200 a day years ago and felt that he had a job no one could better since he had made friends, watched children grow up, and become a part of their families"

Not to be for gotten among the ambulants are the sellers of the more traditional foods — ice-drops, \"dirty ice-cream,\" Magnolia prod¬ ucts, and lately such snacks as \"ice scramble\" and \"com nips\" — these of ten near moviehouses and schools. The streetfood sellers who use carts that park in certain areas during relatively fixed hours are, as Edilberto Alegre points out, a step away from the permanence of restaurants. These are transient carin- derias since they of fer food that can only be eaten sitting down and thus have to set out benches for their customers. The dishes they purvey are 158 Sarap; Essays on Philippine Food usually those that can be cooked ahead and heated on site: goto, arroz caldo, pancit, mami. Goto by itself is a whole phenomenon that has already been written about. Suffice it to note that no longer does it contain only chicken or tripe, but also such exotica as fat-lined bituka and mat a ng baka. Semi-permanence of another kind is that of the lechong manok, which was usually sold on stands poised on sidewalks and sidestreets. The grills presented \"appropriate technology\" of a Third World type, being concocted of bicycle wheels, little motors, non-motorized pulleys, lots of child labor, or just one man's raw muscle power, The gadget required some kind of permanence, yet it didn't move in doors, but stayed on the street, where its aroma wafted customers into its environs, to sniff and wait communally, as around a village campfire. Because of the rise in the price of chickens, the fad didn't last too long, and now the craze is past. The survivors, however, have become in stitutional¬ ized, and the one on Timog near Mother. Ignacia, for example, of fers roasted liempo, litsong manok and tapsi to go with aproned boys effi¬ ciently cooking, chopping and wrapping. Why this proliferation and profusion? The economist explains that street food is a cash product: it requires a minimum of cash capital and gets capital and profit back the same day. Thus the seller survives — and profits from day to day. For the smallest of these, it is enough \"na nalilibre ang pagkain namin'' — he makes enough to feed his family, with a little left over to buy next day's supplies. For the larger entrepreneurs, it is a viable, reliable small enterprise. The streetfood economy is also in dicative of the crisis in that many can afford only cheap — or the cheapest — food. Furthermore, it reflects the crisis-ethos, in which waste is improper and sinful. Streetfood, finally, is fun, is pop, is affordable, is convenient, is irreverent, is Pinoy — proof of the flexibility of the Filipino, who went through colonization and oppression, crisis and revolution — while remaining whole and himself, even when poor.

The clientele of goto, those with a few extra pesos to spare, have dwindled. Many goto shops have closed. But goto has made its mark on the mid¬ dle class palate. A stabilized peso will stabilize goto.' Where was goto before these dramatic changes? It was sold nightly in a pushcart by Aling Teresa near the corner of Anonas and Aurora Boulevard; in a dingy shop on a side street close to the for mer Cubao Kadiwa, 15 meters from a jeepney stop (four greasy tables so small there's no space to spread elbows, and the 16 creaky chairs so close to one another, there is. no space to walk through); just outside the smelly Nepa-Q-Mart. There were other places where it was served as part of the native merienda menu. An example is Little Quiapo (LQ), which started as a snack shop in the UP of the early 1950 s, Little Quiapo being the name of the shopping area which used to be where the UP Catholic chapel now stands. LQ used to serve only goto, pansit luglug and arroz caldo, and always opened close to a big school, its customers mostly students. That way goto, because of Us relative cheapness, was in troduced to LC^s bourgeois clientele. By 1983, the refore, to the middle class goto was no longer as strange as fried dog, day-old chicks and charcoal-broiled skewered chicken's in testines. It has always been an option for meriendat like pansit and spaghetti. The economic crisis of 1983 pushed it into small- scale specialty restaurants. There was a latent market for it since the middle class, who have the surplus money for merienda, were familiar with it. But let us go back to the other social segment which was also very familiar with it: the lowly laborer/ Because. his capital is his brawn, he cannot, like of fice employees or teachers, delight in light repasts. When he eats, even just merienda, he really eats. Anything made of rice holds longer, and so Aling Teresa of Anonas/ Aurora normally sold 50 bowls of goto every night. Her customers were mostly taxi drivers, security guards, gasoline station at tendants and others who worked the night shift. For some, goto was not a treat between meals; it was a meal itself. What are the in gredients of goto? First of all, there's the rice gruel. It is even better if there is some malagkit to make it glutinous. This portion some Tagalogs refer to as lugao. To produce a light gisado flavor in the soup, peeled garlic cloves, slivers of ginger, and if one prefers, sliced on ions, are sauteed slightly, then water, plain rice and 162 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food malagkit are added with a gisa in tent. Then the container is almost filled with water in a 1:5 ra|jo, and salt is added. Water can be added periodically to maintain the consistency of the gruel since the pot is made to simpler until it is completely consumed. Goto is always eaten hot. The sahog can be isao, goto, mata ng baka, or, as in a Makati shop, bayag ng baka. These can all be bought in the market washed and cleaned and ready for boiling. They are boiled in a separate pot and are taken out and sliced into chewable portions and added to a bowl of gruel just before goto is eaten. Or, after the isao and goto have already been boiled tender, they are mixed with the simmering gruel and retrieved, then sliced into bite-sizes just before eating. Neecfiess to say, the mata ng baka, thought to be very nutritious, and the bayag ng baka, regarded as an aphrodisiac, make goto even more exotic. To the steaming bowl of gruel and sahog, paper-thin slices of gar¬ lic precisely fried to a dry, brown crisp, and neatly chopped fresh spring on ions are added. Pepper, kalamansi and patis are optional gar¬ nish. Some shops now premix kalamansi juice and patis and of fer this in a separate bottle. In eating goto the proprietor fixes the taste and consistency of the gruel and sahog. This is his contribution to the dish. Once it is in the bowl, the customer takes over; he decides, according to his personal taste, the final flavor of the dish since he has free access to the different garnishes and can add as much as he wants, or not add any at all"

Goto is thus a dialectic product of the economic constraints of the proprietor and the creative freedom of the customer. It is a partici¬ patory delight. What are some of the goto places I know well? My turf is the Kamias-Cubao area. An old favorite was GOTO KAMI along Kamias Street near the Kalayaan in tersection. The shop is still there, still specializing in goto, still with the same menu: okoy, to kwa't baboy (which is of ten served in sit-down goto shops) and pritong lumpia, and still produces the same isao goto. It has established reliability. One knows what one will eat; expectations are fulfilled and there are no surprises. It has even maintained the same decor — mostly white (walls, counter and bilao on the wall on which the prices are written) and green at the edges. Prices have gone up though, to P 6.50 a serving. Across the Farmers Market is a very busy bus stop and close to it is the goto shop ment ioned earlier. Because of its location, it is always full of customers. Sometimes out of boredom the waitresses act as hawkers although they are less in timidating than the ones in Central Market or in Aranque Market, who literally pull you to sit and eat. The goto here is sometimes watery; the gruel consistency is unpredictable. But the pot contains large globes of beef fat, and they are sliced as if they were meat. Ang Goto 163 At night the Aurora Boulevard portion fronting the Mercury Drugstore is lined with pushcart food stalls which disappear at about six the following morning.

It is on EDSA, at the very corner of Ermin Garcia Street across Nepa Q-Mart as one walks from New York Street. It is a pushcart cum table and bench affair. During rainy days there's a flimsy, tattered plastic makeshift \"awning\" which masquerades as a roof. Only four can be seated at a time, but customers are always coming with their own bowls for take-home goto. And one can buy portions of servings: \"PI.50 lang\" or \"P 2 tang/' \"Pakilagyan ng isang itlog.\" A regular serving costs P 6. Here the goto pot is wide-brimmed and a meter high. A smaller pot contains goto. slices. The other is a gem — it's full of cow's eyes, mata ng baka boiled to succulent softness. The garnishings are complete on the table, and the best time to eat goto there is when it is drizzling. The whole enterprise is run by a middle-aged Ilocana who just sits on a bench at the back and whose apron pockets gradually fill up with coins * and paper money as the hour passes.

They provide the solid contrast to the 164 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food pospas liquid. Aling Ines serves her pospas only from 3 to 6 p. m. Goto has become ubiquitous. It can be found wherever there are food stalls or wherever native fare is sold. It is food for people on the go and so is served in either stand-up stalls or sit-down shops. One other sign that it has become class is that after it was claimed as specialty food, it found its way into the periphery of the Greenhills Shopping Center, at the very successful GOOD AH. This long-ago food of the marketplaces, streetcorners and home kitchens had to be transformed into an aphrodisiac or into exotica before it could make its way into the shopping areas of the elite, to become fad and fashion. Goto is rice-based and thus conforms to our food expectations. Since it is light, it is right for a repast. There is something borrowed in it — the flavored gruel (Chinese) and the gisa preparation (Spanish) — and so like many of our popular foods, it is more in digenized than in digenous. The customer participates actively in the process of pro¬ ducing the taste of the dish, and thus it is not a given; one contributes to the shaping of what one in gests. The customer is not just a buyer; he is even, only briefly, the master of his palate. Now that it has in ched its way to Greenhills and Makati, one can say that goto is fast becoming the merienda of Metro Manila.

Breakfast iis, early, lunch is at noon and dinner is in the early evening. As agri¬ cultural work is diurnal, the appearance of the sun signals the begin?- ning of the day.

Only rice plus ulam can really satisfy hunger. All else only sees one through to the next scheduled meal. The emergence of two kinds of pantawid gutom comes with two kinds of meals: one traditional, the other western. The traditional meal is rice-based, and the traditional pantawid gutom is also rice- based, e. g. goto, arwz caldor Mbingkm and other rice cakes* Americani¬ zation meant bread for breakfast {pan de sat, pan Americano, now some¬ times called tasty after a well-known brand) and possibly bread too for lunch (bum or rolls for hamburgers and hot dogs, or with steak or other Western ulam), or spaghetti and pizza. This is where ambiguity comes in because spaghetti or pizza or sandwiches can also be considered merienda (not being rice with ulam}. In the urban areas the categories become fuzzed up since the base of the meals has been shifting to wheat, a real sign of the westernization of our taste. The western shift has not yet been completed, however. The traditional pantawid gu. tom can still be purchased even dose to, or at die periphery of, a western in stitution, the supermarket. For in stance, the Layug (a Fampango specialty shop) kahmin is sold at-Queen's Supermarket in Cubao and at Makati Supermart. The small shops that cluster like barnacles around supermarkets exhibit the duality of our meriendas. The entrance to any supermarket is lined with small shops competing for the tired shopper: hot dog or ham- burger stand, pizza stall, goto shop, siopao comer. The Chinese-in- fluenced merienda of hopia and a cola drink is available close to any market — Mepa-Q-Mart, Qtiiapo, Central Market. In fact, hopia fae- to ries are located in the vicinity of large markets* Traditional pantawid gutom, however, are really more avail¬ able where the lower and middle classes market. They' arc still the ones who take sago, gu Jdrrum, buko and other “sa malamig'* or pampa- 168 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food tid uhazv (that which cuts the thirst). Where you find them, this category which is more fluid than solid, you will also find nearby kakanin and goto which are, of course, more solid than liquid. Here too is where banana-cue belongs. Banana-cue is sold in stalls or by itinerant peddlers who are of ten children or housewives. The two ways of distributing it in dicate that banana-cue is close to being in stitutionalized. Peddling is more eva¬ nescent, but selling it in a permanent structure means that there. is a definite clientele, one large enough to in duce the small capitalist to in vest in a gas stove, a large kawali and a stall. Daily he buys hun¬ dreds of saba and kilos of brown sugar. Two such stalls have been in business for at least three years. One is on Anonas Extension close to the corner of V. Luna Road, strategically located at the entrance to Sikatuna Village. The other is across the PHILCOA building, one of several stores close to the tricycle stop of UP Village. They operate in exactly the same manner: saba is bought or delivered early in the morning; cooking starts at around 9 a. m.; and by 10 a. m. cooked saba is available either on the stick as banana-cue, or in side lumpia wrappers, as turong saging. Around 2 p. m. the cooking starts again. The other distribution outlet targets only the 3 p. m. merienda hour.

It must be because of the sabaz the sugar, the way it is cooked, its portability. Saba is a banana which is not eaten raw. It is boiled, broiled, or sliced and fried. It is an in gredient in our nilagang baka. Dipped in batter and fried, it is another merienda item — maruya. In Agusan del Sur the green saba is sliced, boiled, and then dipped in bagoong. In Caloocan saba is broiled over charcoal and Dari-Creme is spread over it after it has been skewered on a barbecue stick. In Negros the green saba is sliced, cooked in heavy syrup, gathered in little bunches in paper cones, to become the very popular pinasugbo. Saba is on the sweetish side, as other bananas are, but it's \"heavier\" than the others. In different forms it has always been with us as a pantawid gutom — an energy-giving food not quite heavy or serious enough to be a meal. Its being coated in sugar is an in genious to uch. Sugar alleviates hunger immediately. It counteracts the flow of gastric acid when one is hungry. But it is a temporary \"high.\" This explains too the effect of soft drinks. Banana-cue is pantawid gutom talaga. In-between Food: The Case of Banana-Cue 169 How is banana-cue cooked? First, it is turned over and over in hot cooking oil to ensure its being evenly cooked. The process is not really deep frying, for in deep frying the juice of what is being cooked is \"sealed\" in side. This one is closer to boiling saba in cooking oil. Just when it is about to be cooked, brown sugar is sprinkled while it is continually turned over. It is then skewered on a bamboo barbecue stick, singly or in pairs. The cooking method is similar to frying sliced sabat except that the fried slices are later dipped in sugar and cannot be eaten on the go like banana-cue, but are usually served on a plate with a fork. Banana-cue answers the need for pantawid gutom of the mobile urban dweller. Another portable and allied alternative is turong saging. This is eaten from a small plastic bag and sold singly. It requires more work. The peeled saba is cut lengthwise, but not split. Langka is tucked in side like a sandwich filling, and the whole rolled in brown sugar, wrapped in a lumpia wrapper, and then deep-fried. This manner of cooking saba is close to, and derives from, lumpia. The product is lumpiang saging or fried turon. Lastly, there is a price aspect. Banana-cue is the most filling at its price level, which varies according to the place where it is sold. At PI (a single banana) or P 2 (a pair), it really sees one through his hunger to the next lunch or supper. Nothing is as filling at this price, and the dwindling peso in creases its clientele. The convergence of being \"mabigat sa tiyan/' \"matamis,\" and \"puwedeng kainin habang luma- lakad\" assures it a long life in the busy, mobile, urban world.

The pushcarts are. ambulant carinderias, replete with plates, glasses, spoons and forks, soft drinks, stove, and even an occasional bangko for the customer. They line up along one side of Aurora Boulevard — in front of Mercury on one side and in front of Max's Chicken House on the other. They are fixtures at the in tersection until dawn, and here is where one sees the night people of Quezon City on parade. They of fer light merienda like siopao, goto or lumpia, and pancit, or meals com¬ plete with rice and fish or meat dishes. They too practise terri¬ to riality. There are three ways of eating the food sold in these stalls. One can purchase them and then eat them while walking like peanuts, banana-Q or even siopao. For carinderia-type meals, one of course has to sit. For other kinds of food, one has to stop and eat standing up; for example, barbecue, fried day-old chicks, fish balls and others which require sawsawan that of course stay on the carts. This is where one finds the widest variety. All of the chicken except its feathers is eaten. We now regard chickens as if they were pigs — all in gestible except for their hair. Before the economic crisis of the 1980 s, one could find in ihaw na bituka ng manok only in Divisoria, the clientele for which were the cargadores. Older people also say that they ate chicken in testines during the \"Japanese time.\" The proli¬ feration of barbecued chicken in testines and their acceptance are an in dication of how difficult our economic life has become. We used to throw away chicken in testines — into big bins in the markets — for fertilizer, we were told. We ate and still eat the in nards of chicken — balunbalunan, atay, puso. All else was refuse. Now we eat what we traditionally regarded as refuse. This probably started too with the acceptance of puwit ng manok in beer pubs as part of pulutan. Then in lowly beer joints, chicken feet (a dimsum delicacy, but not the way we prepare it), chicken heads and necks, started to appear. From then on it was one step to chicken in testines. This revolution in taste, the further democratization of the food range of the lower class, was also brought about by the mass production of chickens, or the development of the poultry in dustry. In supermar¬ kets and even markets in Metro Manila and other urban centers we can buy only dressed chickens. This means that the balun-balunan, atay Stand-up, Sit-down Food 173 and puso are sold in bulk, separate from the chicken meat. Max's Chicken always sold this as one of its specialties. That is because Max's too was based on the mass production of chicken. Chicken in¬ testines can be bought in bulk in Nepa Q-Mart separate from balun- balunan, atay and puso. (It can also be bought already neatly threaded on thin barbecue sticks.) Its chief at traction is its cheapness. The availability in bulk has made it possible for the food to move from Divisoria to Cubao and other popular areas. The barbecue stall requires minimum capital — a folding portable stand, a kilo or two of charcoal, a huge parilla, several bottles of sauces (in varying degrees of peppery hotness) and the material to be bar¬ becued.

The pop euphemisms lend a modern air to what is really quite elemental, \"barbaric\" fare, and thus clothe this modern barbarity in an accept¬ able verbal facade. The continued existence of these stalls means that our economy has not improved, that they have conquered a portion of our hungry population, that we have in deed become quite comfortable with them. There is something basic to all these in ihaw — they need to be dipped in sauce. The sawsazvan is necessary because broiling removes water, and what is ready to be eaten is very dry. This is also why there is always a sa malamig nearby. We have to top anything solid with gulps of something liquid. It is a tropical habit, a dictate of our warm clime. The sawsawan is the creative space for the stall owner. After all, how much variation can one produce in broiling squid or IUD or Adidas? How many different degrees of moistness and crispness can one produce with Walkman? Some customers in fact keep going back to particular stand-up stalls because of the distinctiveness of the sawsawan. Sauce makes the difference. And what goes into the sauce? It's basically that which goes into the sinamac of the Ilongos — vinegar, on ions, different kinds of chili peppers, in cluding labuyo, garlic, salt, a little sugar. The sawsawan in these stalls is communal. Except in the case of day-old chicks, everyone dips his barbecue sticks into the same bottle of sauce used by the others. It might be unhygienic, but the sharing of a to lerable level of germs produces immunity. Besides, ashy flakes from 174 Samp: Essays on Philippine Food the dipped barbecue give the sauce a Hide bitterness and allow it to evolve in taste. The next step for these barbecues is to find their way into the regular fare of sit-down pulu tan/beer shops. We still always drink beer sitting down. The fad for ihaw-ihaw is long over. The prohibitive price of squid killed the fad. Chicken has become very expensive, too. But one still needs pulutan when one drinks. The food in these stand-up stalls is not taken with alcohol; it is really the poor man's merienda. The next step would in volve wedding diem to drinking. This is in fact already taking place in that many such stalls operate close to cheap beer pints. However, for these fare to go up the social ladder, there must be improvement in content — and the biggest improvement could be done with the sauce. One can add herbs — rosemary, basil, even or egano and thus make the sauce exotic — refine, fine-tune it. Or perhaps it can be thickened, blended and combined with other flavorings. Or one can use pineapple vinegar. So many variations could definitely be made. It already has a slot in our food categories — under thaw. The problem is. one of creative in novation. Now a note on the day-old chick. In the rationalization of the poultry business, the newly hatched chick has to be differentiated according to gender. Butts are examined with the help of an electric bulb, and the males are thrown into a box for immediate extermination, while the females are kept for fattening or to be made into layers. This is because the male chicken has become unnecessary: the female chicken need not be fertilized to lay eggs; feeds take care of that. It also takes more feed to make male chicks gain weight. Commercially they are not viable, so they were made into fertilizer, or just thrown away, usually into the sea. The day-old chick for mula started from that throw-away phe¬ nomenon. No one knows who in vented the recipe. It is quite simple; the chicks are cooked like cheap camaron rebosado or tempura — meaning dipped in a batter of starch and or angey food coloring before frying, then dipped into a vinegar preparation garnished with garlic, pepper and salt before eating.

The middle class have very Stand-up, Sil-dmcm Food 175 regularly scheduled eating habits, regulated according to an eight-hour work day. Farmers, farm laborers and fishermen lead a less clock- regulated quotidian life, with eating hours not really all that fixed. But even to them anything not quite as hearty as a meal, even if taken at the regular mealtime, is pantawid gutom. So a host apologetically enjoins his guests to take the light repast of fered because it is not a real meal: \"Sige na ho, pantawid gutom long, pero... The sit-down stalls provide both regular meals and pantawid gutom. Depending on the time and the condition of one's pockets, one could choose to have a light or a hearty meal. The fact that the stalls are a regular fixture in Cubao at tests to an. existent clientele. They are the poor man's version of eating out. The benches afford one the opportunity to linger for small talk, for a brief social encounter. Eating standing up negates such a possibility. Naturally, food eaten sitting down is more costly since it has entered a structure one step away from a restaurant. This is also literally true in Cubao because these stalls are either on the street or on the pavement, and the restaurants, the fixed food stalls, are just a few steps away physically — although many steps away up the social ladder and the economic scale. ENA 1 Pulutan: The Pleasure of the Changing T is said that Filipinos drink for three reasons: because they are sad, or because they are happy, or because there is no reason at all. While the first two could be explained in terms of catharsis and sharing, the last in the triad is what probably distinguishes the Filipino as drinker. The occasion does not create the reason for drinking; the drinker creates the occasion. He drinks not necessarily to celebrate nor to share, but simply to drink. He is the quint essential drinker. The event as well as the place is termed in uman. The suffix \"-an/ han\" does not imbue the root word with any coloration; it simply reports a place where something takes place: a locative, as in \"sakay- an,\" \"tinda-han,\" \"pasuk-an.\" Or, it simply reports an event, as in 178 Sarttp: Essays on Philippine Food \"suntuk-an \" \"sayaw-an\" \"kasalan.\" To in dicate the imbibing of liquid, one prefixes \"urn-” (\"Uminom muna tayo, may oras pa naman\").

It is simply that there are acts we do with others. It is not ''Mag-beer ka murnf but '\"'Mag-beer mum tat/o f IV Pulutan appears in the occasion called in uman. The event is termed thus because the principal action in it is the drinking, not the taking of pulutan. Pulutan is auxiliary, minor, and at certain periods or even during the entire period of the drinking event can be optional. The distinction becomes clear in this: in uman is an event, pulutan is an optional objed in that event Since pulutan is something one picks up, it must be a food-object which one can place between thumb and for efinger. Off course one may \"pick* peanuts from a saucer on the fable with three, four, five fingers, or even with one's whole hand (dakot). And one would not usually tear off a portion of newly grilled fish with one's bare fingers. One could use an extension of one's fingers: a fork. The use of spoons, forks* knives and picks or to othpicks with, pulutan is a spill-over of the custom of puht into the modem setting. The food-ob ject which goes with drink is still termed pulutan even when one no longer picks it up with one's fingers.

And one does these with others. Conversation flows as wine should. Not a natural event, but a human happening. Not quite a ritual, but quite ritualistic. First, the drinks; then the food. More drinking. A little eating. More drinking. And before the first and the succeeding, enveloping the entire event — talk. Lots of it. Endless. Oral in quality. Orality extreme and supreme. Far from being threatened by repetition, the drinking event thrives on it. Repetition is enriching. It enriches the social bonds. Boredom is kept away by the pulutan — novel, seasonal — and the talk: a mixture of memory, dream and reality. The changing slays dullness. There is the nexus of pleasure, in the changing. Pleasure comes from a multiplicity of causes: the drink, the pulu¬ tan, the company, the talk. During the moment of pleasure, usually of extended duration, the causes are in distinguishable from each other. They merge, overlap, flow. Pleasure is a convergence, an ephemeral composition, a temporary in tersection of the unchanging and the changing. Sensuality keen and sheer. 'Pulutan\" in Situ Writing about food in volves mining one's personal past, bringing memory to bear on the present. Enjoyment is always a duration, however transient and ephemeral the experience may be. Since it is a sensual experience, there is always remembering and dreaming. Fragments from the subconscious. Splinters from a lode there dormant, but always there. And the present, the moment, the morsel of food on the to ngue, dives into that dormant darkness and brings it to the surface, to light, and there in the encounter, in the now, the moment takes a shape that endures a little more, into the not-yet not-yet, a wee slice of the moment not repeated but extended. A pushing of the past- present into the future. All enjoyment is present progressive. And that is the grid of sensual pleasure: in put-ed datum recalled, lighting this now-moment and overlapping a little into the next slice of time. And that is the vertical horizontal grid of all our verbs in the present tense: LASA (root word) = LASAHAN (verb): LINASAHAN (past) LJNALASAHAN (present) LALASAHAN (future) The past is in dicated by the in fix \"-in-\"; the future by the reduplica¬ tion of the first syllable of the root verb form, i. e. \"la-\". The present is a combination, i. e. for med by the in fix \"-in-\" and the reduplicated first syllable \"la-\". Thus our sense of the present is always a little of the past pushing into a little of the future. We are in deed a people who live in the hedonistic present. Pulutan: The Pleasure of the Changing 181 And there lies the richness of our perception. Time is not seg¬ ment ed. Time does not flow in a horizontal line. Time is duration. Time is focus. Time is never just a slice of an in dependent, all-unto-itself moment. It is a flowing from into to. Memories and dreams are fragments of time and experience focused, enduring.

The pulutan kept coming: in ihaw na baboy dipped in suka't dinikdik na bazvang, crisply to asted dilis and suka't siling labuyo, salted peanuts. Then came one I had never had before: burong hipon, made three days before by an of ficemate. River shrimps. Orangey in color. Fer¬ ment ed rice. Sauteed briefly in garlic. He asked a daughter to pick mus- tasa leaves from the backyard. These were washed and placed on a plate. Droplets of water still clung to them. He showed me how to eat it the Pampango way: roll into the mustard leaf a small amount of the sauteed buro. Since these were na¬ tive mustasa. leaves, they were small, and one leaf-roll could easily be placed in side the mouth as one tilted one's head backwards. It was a neat operation. The leaves were crunchy; and when one bit into them, the slight pungency of mustard spread in the mouth. The leaves were young so they were not bitter, just pleasantly pungent. This pungency mixed into the softness of the fermented rice and tiny shrimp, and there was a hint of sourness from the buro. Only three days old, the buro was not really sour. Somewhere there was a hint of garlic, very slight. The softness of the buro made the mustard leaf seem especially crisp. As I savored the buro, I remembered my Ilocana grandmother's burong dalag. Hers had a peculiar odor, like sourish bagoong. It was also on the salty side. My father, a Tagalog who grew up in Sampaloc, Manila, never ate it, never even to lerated it on the table. So we always had it on the sly — in the kitchen with my grandmother, the maids, and the farmers and their families. Somehow I always associated it 182 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food with stolen pleasures. There was no nepd to saute her buro, but when it was sauteed, we all felt that it was a festive treat. Buro is of course a way of preserving surplus shrimp and fish. We would keep them in jars under the house. Using fermented rice meant that there also was a surplus of rice. Surplus in Victoria, Tarlac, my hometown, was seasonal. There were no irrigation canals and no IRRI system in my youth. Shells like kuhol and fish such as dalag, hito, gurami, all came from the rice fields and the small rivers. Thus this preserved food, in cluding bagoong, meant ulam through the lean dry months after the December harvest. IRRI has since destroyed the seasons of my youth, and in San Fernando, Pampanga burong hipon is available the whole year round. Since then I have tasted similar buro in other places — the balaw balaw of Angono's Balaw-Balaw restaurant, the burong hipon at Trel¬ lis Restaurant in Quezon City, and the burong Kapampangan in Cabalen in Quezon City, where it comes with mustard leaves. However, the one in my childhood friend's home remains unequalled. I have been there a few times after that, and his wife always managed to find freshly made buro. I always feel that it is a treat. That first time is what I always remember. There was friendship renewed and there was the discovery of a pulutan. The distinctive tastiness of food (sarap) is always where, for a short moment, memory and dream in tersect and in ter-react with the present; and they remain as remembered pleasure since the in teraction took place in the warmth of friendship. DOG MEAT: The Case of the (Semi-) underground 'Pulutan' In the small town of Victoria, Tarlac dogs were pets, and not fair game for meat.

It was said in my town then that only Igorots*and Kapampangans ate it. By the mid-sixties dog meat was being sold in the market restaurants. And of course it was not only Kapampangans who relished the different dishes into which dog meat was cooked. Dogs can no longer roam the town streets freely. This is not for fear of the implementation of municipal or dinances. Dog has become fair Pulutan: The Pleasure of the Changing 183 game for those who drink as well as for those who simply want to make a little cash. Dog meat has moved from whispered presence in drinking sessions to a desired market commodity. The food choice of a few has become a delicacy for many. Certainly there is the rarity factor, which drives the price of dog meat higher than that of goat, venison or pork. There is never enough of it, and raising dogs for meat has not yet become a small backyard enterprise. Also, there are municipal or dinances which have not been rescinded, and they specifically penalize the killing of dogs for meat. Even in my town they are no longer peddled in the market, whether raw or cooked. They have disappeared even in Munoz, Nueva Ecija, where in the late 1960 s they were available on-a-pole (like lechon) in the public market. Dog meat remains underground fare, and that keeps. its price high. Given a choice, many drinkers to day would choose dog meat over goat or any ihaw-ihaw. Live dogs are weighed and bought at PI 7 a kilo. Cooked, they cost P 10 a saucer in Metro Manila carinderias. In better or cleaner places prices go up to P 20-P 25 a platito. One can actually just have pieces and morsels of it. Its price keeps it at the level of a delicacy. The legal prohibitions against slaughtering dogs for meat mean that where it is of fered in public eating places (such as in a drinking place in Grace Park, Caloocan and in a restaurant by the side of the Nepa Q-Mart in Quezon City) there is a policeman who protects the place from raids. May padrino. Or the policeman himself may own the place. There have been no court cases or arrests related to the serving of dog meat in public places. Friends who grew up in Pampanga or the Pampango-speaking side of Tarlac relate that dog meat is part of their culinary tradition. The same as frogs, mole crickets and winged white ants. There are no taboos against them. When the delicacies find their way to fast-food counters or restaurant menus, frog is betute (stuffed, similar to rellenong bangus or alimango); mole cricket is lightly adobado. Dog meat in Metro Ma¬ nila is served only as dry adobo, estopado or kaldereta. Dog cuisine had to go underground because of unresolved municipal or dinances which prohibit the eating of dogs. In to wns where there is no explicit law against it, there is harassment from the police, local or national, or some supposedly civic-or iented groups. But many continue to relish dog meat. Part of its at traction derives precisely from its being kept underground. The sentiment is derived from the British- or Amer¬ ican-imbibed idea that killing dogs (which are beloved pets in the Anglo-American countries) especially for their meat is an immoral, if not criminal, act of cruelty. But the eating of pork and beef is allowed. Thus the Philippine at titude to wards dog meat really has no basis in our democratic culinary tradition, in which aniihals are equally edible. 184 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food The only objection, which is scientific in basis, is the fact that* the lethal virus that causes rabies in dogs cannot be neutralized by boiling, frying, broiling, sauteeing or any other way of cooking.

A few elderly ones wear corchos, probably on their way to or from a nearby cockpit. Some look like in terns. Most of them look middle class. The price, P 30 a plate, defines its clientele. The noise level is high. Since everyone is talking at the same time one has to raise one's voice a pitch higher to keep from being drowned out. No one appears to be in a hurry and no one seems to be all that in tent about the drinking. Definitely this is a pulutan place. And a stopping-by place, where one stops by on the way to somewhere. Some even come solo. The beer and rum are available even at one's street comer store so it must be the pulutan that at tracts such a regular crowd. \"Palagi hong ganito,\" answers one of the elderly waitresses. The kitchen but chers at least three dogs a day, she adds. No, the apartment has never been raided. It started as a four-table drinking- by-the-roadside place more than a decade ago. And yes, it has always of fered only beer and the same pulutan. Rum was added much later, and only when the price of beer went up. The kaldereta is soft and just on the edge of being piquant. The estopado, mushy-on- the-outside, pinchable-on the-in side, has a wisp of pungency. The adobo is sauceless, lots of garlic sticking to the flesh and bones. None of them taste as one would expect dog meat to taste, given the legend (it makes the body hot and perspiration doggy in smell). But one knows it is dog meat since it does not taste like pork, or beef, or goat. It is rather tasty and especially good as pulutan. Dog meat cooked with out expertise exudes its peculiar smell, like the anggo of goat or the lansa of fish. Dog meat cooked with out enough spices leaves an after-taste that refuses to be rinsed away even after a day. The taste is in the sweat. Expertly cooked dog meat, however, will not make one smell like a dog even after an hour of jogging.

They provide party food for auspicious occasions — birthdays, weddings, fiestas. They are a part of many childhoods, especially those of Ilocanos. At least a day before it is but chered the goat is not fed anything solid. In Laoag it is fed a special kind of grass a few hours before it is killed, and this partially digested grass endows the in nards with special flavor. The goat in stinctively knows it is to be but chered, and it literally cries — sheds tears — when the knife is at its throat. The but chered goat is then placed in boiling water, after which its hair is shaved off with a knife. Its in nards are taken out, the in testines and the bile carefully set aside. The sweat glands must be taken out in tact, otherwise all the dishes would have the in tense malodor of goats, anggo. The in testines are sliced into small bits, spiced, boiled and sprinkled with bile before serving. This is pina- paitan. The goat is then singed, skinned and quartered. Its skin is cut into 186 Scrap: Essays on Philippine Pood small slices and with bits of soft flesh, marinated in vinegar, salt, pepper and sibuyas Tagalog. This is kappukan (\"; pukan \" is very spe¬ cific; it refers to cutting off branches of trees or cutting down bamboo), a dish somewhat similar to kinilaw, as in kinilaw na tanguingue. The ribs and the knuckles are soured with tamarind or alibang- bang leaves into a soup. The rest is cooked as kaldereta and estopado; some Pampanguenos also make dinuguan. In Hagonoy the quartered goat (which is picturesquely referred to as \"tinipak\") is hung for a day — to make the flesh softer, easier to cook, the people say. Perhaps the pro¬ cess removes its peculiar smell. While in the Ilocano region goat is fiesta food of ten preferred even to lechon, in Hagonoy as in many other places in Luzon and the Visayas goats are specifically but chered into pulutan dishes. Only the hair, horns and hooves of the goat are not eaten. Most of it becomes pulutan. In Cuenca, Batangas drinkers have developed a taste for goat testicles, and if one is not watchful, all his male goats could end up castrated for the sake of pulutan. II Goats do not form a part of our quotidian diet. They are occasion food. Since no goat recipe is sweet nor even close to being sweetish, like puchero with saba or sweet-sour fish, then pinapaitan, kappukan and kaldereta easily slide into our choices for pulutan. Furthermore, none of them is soupy. In a horizontal scaling of recipes according to viscosity, the soured soup from the bones of the goat (which the Ilocanos term a-nger, mean¬ ing boil) would be at one end and kappukan at the other. Pinapaitan and kaldereta would be close to kappukan. Soups do not qualify for pulutan since it is in appropriate to pair a liquid with alcoholic drinks which,. of course are also liquid. Neither can soups be picked up with the fingers (pulot). Pulutan preferences cluster to wards the less viscous. Fish, chicken and pork are available daily in the market and can be bought by the kilo. They can also be cooked by only one person. In contrast, goat meat is not usually sold in the public markets, although some supermarkets (e. g. Tropical Hut on Edsa/Ortigas) have it in packs, just like pork or beef. Dog meat is not available in any super¬ market or public market.

The Parameters of 'Pulutan' Pulutan is a category like kanin and u\\am. Thus there are dishes which are pampulutan, meaning especially good as pulutan. Dog and goat meat belong to this preference. There are also ways of cooking which are specific to preparing pulutan, like kappukan and kinilazu. Other modes of cooking overlap with the way ulam is prepared — kaldereta, adobo, estopado, ihaw, prito. Thus, depending on the use of the dish it can be ulam.(it eaten with rice) or pulutan (eaten while having an alcoholic beverage). Pulutan is the refore really function- specific, being any solid which one eats while drinking. Kung walang in uman, walang pulutan. And if one partakes of the pulutan dish when there is no drinking, one is simply eating (either kumakain or nagpa- papak). Pulutan exists in the context of drinking; it is the drinking which makes possible the existence of pulutan. One can drink and have no pulutan but one cannot have pulutan with out drinking. Most of our pulutan come from the animal kingdom. There is very little fat in them. They are taken in morsels or prepared in bite sizes. They are served raw (like oysters), semi-raw (like kinilaw), in ihaw, ginisa, pinirito. Anything nilaga is hardly ever served as pulutan. The rarest pulutan would be the most exotic. In Paombong, Bulacan newly-born mice are dipped in the strong local nipa vinegar. These go very well with gin. In Cuenca, Batangas \"bat and ball\" are a favorite — sauteed bits and slices of the penis and testicles of oxen. Monitor lizard (bayawak ), cooked adobo sa bawang, linasing na palaka (drun¬ ken frogs) in Angono. Kamaru (mole crickets) fried very crisp in Pam- panga. Locusts adobado in Negros. Every region has its own exotica. Since we usually boil our vegetables, if we have vegetables at all as pulutan they would have to be raw, like the mustard leaf used in the buro roll, or roots such as singkamas and carrots (and other crudites adapted from the West). Among fruit, so far only green mango has edged into the pulutan category. We hardly take anything from the very green world around us to use as pulutan. Almost anything that moves, however, can be made into pulutan — in sects, birds, reptiles, mammals; herbivores, carnivores, omnivores. There is hardly any food taboo, especially for those economically hard up. We eat the entire animal — even skin, eyes, ears, nose, butt, in¬ nards. The only portions we do not eat are those we cannot digest: hair, feathers, bones, horns, hooves. But if we had the enzymes to transform these in or ganic materials into or ganic form, we would eat them too. The Filipino is truly democratic in his choice of pulutan; anything that can be eaten he eats. His mind is unfettered; it is his enzymes which limit his choices. 188 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food The Filipino acquiesces to what is available and in novates within the givens. He is creative, resilient, ever curious. While there is a core of traditionally accepted pulutan, the repertory is expandable. The converts to dog meat and the devotees of goat are in creasing. At the other end of the economic scale there are more who now relish chicken in testines and day-old chicks. When one says \"OK tiaman\" of a pulutan he has never tasted before, that vague/ambiguous catch-all covers anything which is not spoiled, mapait, malansa. That is, anything edible, anything which does not violate his gustatory sense. When he approves, he repeats emphatically, \"OK! OK ito Y' The change from \"OK naman \" or \"OK din\" to \"OK!\" takes place after a time of conditioning. Changes in food preferences begin with to lerance, then go through testing or trial from need or curiosity, and move on to acceptability till finally one develops a taste, a preference, for the food.

The changing repertory of our pulutan at tests to our openness to change. There are really no fixed para¬ meters— sige, tikman natin. Memory and tradition (or conditioning) pull us, tether us to our safe old worlds, but necessity and curiosity push us to venture into new worlds. Look at our migration pattern: not only immigration to other lands, but migration within our country. When people travel, they take with them their food world. That is changed as it changes the other food worlds encountered. It is not in conceivable that in a decade more people in Mindanao would be relishing asusena and kambing. Inuman is a constant in the world of the Filipino, and pulutan is the expanding, changing aspect of that social aspect of his life. Thus one part of him is constant, the other flirts about looking for new possibilities, trying out hitherto untried flavors. While he keeps his memories and his traditions, he will venture into unknown worlds. Pulutan implies a small quantity. No sating. No gorging. Pap Ulut- pulut lang talaga. Variety. Patikim-tikim. Pulutan connects him to other possibilities. Chinks and slivers of other worlds. And why not? That is the world of pulutan. Why not, in deed? Tradition, the tradi¬ tion of pulutan itself, sanctions his transient tour of other worlds and his desire to savor the promised flavors of the beckoning unknown. ENA Puto-Bumbong, Bibingka, Salabat, atbp: The Filipino Christmas Table 'M dreaming of a green Christmas,\" wrote a Filipina working at the United Nations in New York. In the midst of the snow and tinsel, the bright shop windows and the glittering trees of an American Christmas, she remembered the soft lantern light from a star-shaped parol, the nip in the air as one walked to the dawn misa de gallo, and especially the food: \"It was not really the choir voices nor the whispered prayers of our elders that kept us awake. It was something else... the promise of the piping hot puto bumbong being prepared by the vendors along the way home that kept our spirits up, our appetites whetted, and hence, our senses disquieted. The sweet lavender rice sprouting out of little bamboo tubes, to pped by a generous sprinkling of grated coconut meat and brown sugar, was part Puto-Bumbong, Bibingka, Salabat, atbp.: The Filipino Christmas Table 191 of our Christmas delight.\" She was, of course, remembering the makeshift stalls that sprout like mushrooms the week the dawn masses begin. Along the streets leading to the churches, and especially in the patios — at Las Pinas, under an ancient tree lit by a galaxy of lanterns — are built lean-tos made from bamboo poles and roofed with old blankets or coconut leaves, with a dulang in front serving as counter. From them cooking smells tantalize the churchgoers and render children impatient to get through mass. Not only is there puto bumbong made from violet-colored piru- rutung rice, but also bibingka, flat and soft and fragrant m banana leaves a mite singed by the charcoal fire above and below. Sometimes these have a bit of native cheese on them, or a sliver of salted egg — but always they come with freshly grated coconut meat for sprinkling on the hot, moist and golden cake. With it is served a customary free cup of hot tea or salabat, ambrosia on a cold morning. The above simbang gabi fare in the Tagalog provinces is echoed by other rice cakes and dishes in other regions at Christmastime. It is as if our for ebears, dependent on rice as staple and base and year-round pampabigat sa tiyan, gratefully gave it primacy of place in the cele¬ bration of the native Christmas. Thus, just as breads mark Christmas for the German, pudding for the Englishman, and cakes like Buche de Noel and Gateaux des Rois for the Frenchman, so rice cakes signify Christmas for the Filipino.

In Pampanga, for example, the region acknowledged to have some of the richest gastronomic traditions, the Christmas week specialties in clude putong sulot and especially putong lusong eaten with panara. Putong lusong is a white, anise-flavored cake cut in thick trapezoidal wedges; panara is a little pasty filled with grated upo or green papaya sauteed with garlic, chopped on ion, cooked pork and shrimp, and seasoned with salt and plenty of black pepper. This is wrapped like a turnover in a dough of galapong, anisado wine and achuete, then fried in hot fat in a large kawali right in front of the buyer. It comes sizzling out of the pan and is laid on banana leaf-covered tables to cool. \"They were hot!\" remembered the late Enriqueta David Perez (author of the excellent, long-running cookbook Recipes of the Philip¬ pines). \"Yet one could hardly wait to pick them up. So I would take two pieces of puto and use them to pick up my panara. The puto would also serve to absorb some of the oil. The combination was perfect: the hot, peppery panara, the soft white puto and a little grated coconut making juice on the to ngue. And tea with pandan and no sugar — hot and fragrant.\" Cebuanos, novelist Lina Espina Moore recounted, call the predawn breakfast painit (since it literally warms one up). It traditionally features hot, sticky chocolate, potomaya (malagkit cooked with coco- 192 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food nut milk), suman bodbod (sweetened malagkit cooked in coconut leaves), biko (sweetened malagkit molded on a plate) and bibingka. Sanirose Singson Orbeta, bom and bred in Vigan, remembers that an important part of her Christmas was the preparation of tinubong, also from rice. A half-cooked puto mixture would be poured into long bamboo tubes and left to cook on coals while the whole town went off to midnight mass. When they returned, the coals would be dying down, the bamboo charred and the tinubong cooked. The long tubes were then cut and distributed among the family. The lazy (to cook) could buy them at stores in 10-centavo (pre-1950 s prices), 20-centavo and even 50- centavo (for the greedy) lengths. For Sanirose the sound that brings back Vigan media noches is the cracking of hot, charred bamboo tubes in hands eager to get at the food of Christmas. In Laoag, Ilocos Norte, on the other hand, the traditional deli¬ cacy is tupig. Writer Benjamin Pascual, in a piece written for the old Sunday Times Magazine, remembers that the whole town would prepare it \"or risk the wrath of the children.\" Preparations would start before daybreak on December 24, and children would wake up to the sound of the to wnswomen pulverizing the malagkit: \"the rhythmic thuds of thousands of wooden pestles against thousands of mortars in the town became one huge throb of gaiety... we youngsters sat on our haunches to watch the alternately bobbing women. Our purring cats made warm cushions on our laps.\" This variety of puto was flavored with molasses, which had been stored in cans long before the holiday season. \"When the can was not closed tight, lizards burglarized it and feasted and then drowned in sweetness... The upper layer of molasses thus had to be scooped off, and this task fell to us children. For all the exertions of plunging a crowbar into the asphalt-to ugh molasses, we enjoyed the work because we were free to sample the sweet...\" The next step was the grating of coconut to be mixed with the dough, and here again the children in volved the mselves, \"riding\" the coconut graters carved from tree trunks and shaped like horses, dogs or even alligators. The coconut-mixed dough was next wrapped in layers of dark green, mature banana leaves, and cooked by burying them in a huge mound of burning rice chaff, a community oven for several neighbors. \"The virtue of rice chaff is that it does not burst into flames, but smolders in a leisurely way,\" such that the tupig bakes unhurriedly and evenly as in an oven.

(In other to wns coconut fronds are used.) Many other varieties of puto, suman and bibingka exist around the islands, among them putong puti, which in its modern version uses Puto-Bumbong, Bibingka, Salabat, atbp.: The Filipino Christmas Table 193 baking powder; putong pula, sweet with brown sugar; kutsinta colored with lye; rich suman with a thick to pping of latik; \"poverty\" suman with but a hint of coconut milk and sugar; suman to be rolled in sugar, or dipped in coconut, or fried, or rolled in leaves, or folded in leaves, or sliced. And of course there are all the other kakanin for which each region, even each town, has its own names and its own Christmas memories. Still another rice-based Christmas delicacy*is the Filipino tama¬ les, which is quite different from the Mexican variety, being made basically of rice, coconut milk, achuete and ground to asted peanuts, with slices of pork, chicken, duck, shrimp, ham, etc., depending on region, availability and the budget of the maker. A Cebuana remem¬ bers tamales of two kinds: one sweet and one pepper-hot, both wrapped in corn-husks. The famous tamales of Pampanga are wrapped in layers of banana leaf, and those of Sorsogon are said to take three days to make. Those who have them as part of their Christmas memories seek them in vain in the streets and foodshops of the big city. Although this plethora of rice cakes forms the basis of our Christ¬ mas fare, other dishes drawn from the Chinese, Spanish and American in fluences on our food culture have become traditional too — to fam¬ ilies, to regions. This is because the centrality and grandeur of the feast make it imperative to have something special, and \"special\" is deter¬ mined both by the culture and by the in dividual taste. An in for mant from a poor Sorsogon barrio told us, for example, that her family ate fish all year round and had pork adobo once in the year, for the media noche. The next days, it was \"isda na naman.\" \"Special\" for many are the Spanish dishes that have become traditional fiesta fare. For Enriqueta David Perez's family, it was cocido. \"Oh, I could hardly wait for Mass to. be over,\" she told us in that long-ago in terview, \"so that we could have the cocido. It was the usual old-fashioned recipe, with jamon China, chorizo de Bilbao, morcilla, beef kenchi with marrow bone, chicken, pork, cabbage, pechay, carrots,* potatoes, on ion, to mato sauce and a thick broth — and served with eggplant sauce.\" Leni Guerrero of the Ermita Guerrero clan, whose French mother added richly to their Christmas traditions, remembers their customary galantina and relleno, the latter a fat capon stuffed with an assortment of riches, in cluding, in the old days, foie gras, truffles, ground pork, olives, imported pork sausages, Spanish sausages, and such other luxuries. A Pampanga family known for its cooking liked fat nilagang manok for its media noche, the chicken especially fattened and readied for the feast. A Nueva Ecija family had pesang manok; one Negros family always had lechon stuffed with tanglad. How central lechon can be to many a family feast is shown by the near-riot at the ELAR lechon of fice when the machine turning the rows of lechon spits broke 194 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food down.

Local and homemade hams now fill in for the imported type, but most Filipinos of medium and high in come levels cannot think of Christmas even now with out remembering rosy-red slices of ham, with their translucent strips of fat to pped by a thick and delicious sugar layer. Besides these, there were usually acharas of all kinds, sweetly pickled young papayas and other vegetables cut into flowers, stars, but terflies. And a wilderness of desserts: more suman of various per¬ suasions; quivering leche flan fragrant with dayap, macapuno en dulce in pale, translucent strands; santol preserves with that sweet sourness that the Filipino palate cannot resist; preserved citrus fruit peel; pastillas in wrappers with cutout designs and mottoes like \"Recuerdo\" and \"Felices Pascuas\"; masapan, turron and suspiros de pili, jalea de ube in glass jars, thickly and sweetly purple; and whatever other special¬ ties mothers, aunts and grandmothers — all of them long on time and patience — were known for. There were, further, imported delicacies that used to appear only at Christmas time: fragrant apples and Mandarin or anges; walnuts, pecans and Brazil nuts; brown, sticky castanas) bunches of grapes fresh from their sawdust packing; and turrones de jijona and turrones de alicante. The turrones came from Spain in flat, round tins or in wooden boxes that were a ritual to open. They were so hard that they had to be hacked on a wooden cutting board with a very dull knife and were given * out in thin slivers and slices, hard enough to break one's teeth. But they were delicious, a mixture of honey and almonds covered with a paper- thin wafer like a communion hostia, seemingly made for Christmas and for no other season. All the above are still available, but at astrono¬ mical prices, making them part of the Christmas only of the nostalgic elite, and not of the majority. Breakfast on Christmas Day usually featured Spanish-style chocolate: hot and thick (\"Chocolate E\" for espeso) if one could afford it; thin and watery (\"Chocolate A\" for aguado ) if one's budget was cramped. With this rich, savory drink were usually served slices of queso de bola — hard, cream-colored Edam cheese that came in cans — and ensaimadas, whose sweet light dough and but ter-sugar-cheese to pping make thg expatriate Filipino wax nostalgic, since they go so perfectly with the saltiness of the cheese and the heavy sweetness of Puto-Bumbong, Bibingka, Salabat, atbp: The Filipino Christmas Table 195 the chocolate.

The Christmas noonday meal, which may be taken with the immediate family or with one's grandparents, or with the oldest in the clan, depending on familial custom, differs widely in different regions. It might be pinapaitan in Abra (a peppery dish of goat variety meats); embutido or morcon in a Manila household; bam-i in a Cebuano home (chicken, pork, dried shrimp, mushrooms and two kinds of noodle; legend has it that only a Cebuano can cook it properly); pancit Molo in an Ilongo family; sincuchar (beef variety meats) or kilawin of goat meat in an Ilocano homes. In a poor household, it is whatever the budget could make available — the long-kept chicken, rarely seen pork, or the fish and rice of everyday. For the affluent, it is very of ten lechon. In urban homes, it is of ten American roast turkey or baked ham, German ginger-bread and almond stollen, French Buche de Noel. The Filipino Christmas has adapted much from the for eign cultures that history has in troduced into our lives. Just as Christmas cards and trees have joined the belen, villancicos like \"Vamos Pas- to res\" and the misa de gallo; just as blinking Christmas lights surround the star-shaped bamboo parol; so have turkey, cheese cake and rum puddings joined the native and Spanish dishes on the media noche table. 196 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food But, although our Christmases have Spanish and other for eign flavors, basic to it are the puto bumbong, bibingka and salabat in church courtyards, the suman and kutsinta at family reunions, the taste of rice and of home, of which our Christmas memories are made. DGF * The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila AUNG out in the 1950 s hardly ever meant having Filipino food. It meant sizzling steak at Selecta, sate babi at Cafe Indonesia, a hot roast beef sandwich and banana cream pie at Taza de Oro, fried chicken at Max's, chicken honey at Aristocrat, soda fountain specialties at Botica Boie, beef fondue at the Swiss Inn, paella at Alba's on Isaac Peral (not yet U. N. Avenue) and, if you were really loaded and sophisticated, steak at New Europe. Where did one have Filipino food? At home, of course, where one had it day to day, in terlaced with dishes that had been in troduced into home cooking by the for ces of history, like pancit, lumpia, spag¬ hetti and fried chicken. Or at a carinderia, where it wasn't chic as yet to go, just unsanitary, one was warned. The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila 199 A few restaurants did serve Filipino food. D'Mark's, for example, the very first pizza place in Manila, had a popular Bistek a la Pauli¬ na. Whoever Paulina was, her name disguised but slightly the fact that her dish was the or dinary bistek one cooked at home, marinated in soy sauce and kalamansi, served with on ion rings and fried rice. Aristocrat, Bulakena and Selecta, which were popular for teenage dates, graduation parties, post-prom snacks, etc., had what were called \"short or ders\": pancit, longaniza or tapa with fried rice, a ginisang gulay or two, things one didn't usually or der for dinner or on a date, but perhaps for merienda or after a movie. The rumor persisted that all those dishes were tastier at Ambos Mundos, but no self-respecting Atenista or Lasallista would take his colegiala friends (students went out in big groups then, or else heavily chaperoned by maiden aunts, maids or younger brethren) to Ambos Mundos, for the rumor also persisted that the crowd there wasn't quite the correct company for well-brought-up young ladies. The latter al¬ ways wondered with eager and half-fearful curiosity: were they gangsters? movie stars? reporters on the prowl? rogues and rakes of what variety? But their hints were scotched by the boys' ominous warnings: \"There might be trouble.\" When the Manila Hotel opened its Bamboo Room in the 1950 s and actually dared to have an all-Filipino menu, it was a novelty, and much talked about"

The rumor persisted that all those dishes were tastier at Ambos Mundos, but no self-respecting Atenista or Lasallista would take his colegiala friends (students went out in big groups then, or else heavily chaperoned by maiden aunts, maids or younger brethren) to Ambos Mundos, for the rumor also persisted that the crowd there wasn't quite the correct company for well-brought-up young ladies. The latter al¬ ways wondered with eager and half-fearful curiosity: were they gangsters? movie stars? reporters on the prowl? rogues and rakes of what variety? But their hints were scotched by the boys' ominous warnings: \"There might be trouble.\" When the Manila Hotel opened its Bamboo Room in the 1950 s and actually dared to have an all-Filipino menu, it was a novelty, and much talked about. Imagine being able- to or der sinigang as a soup course, and adobo as entree, while being all dressed up for a big sophis¬ ticated night on the town! Still and all, when to urists and other for eigners asked about Filipino food, they were served the cliche: \"The best Filipino cooking is found only at home.\" Although that may still be true, things have changed tremen¬ dously in the last thirty years. Now one walks down a busy Makati street, or drives down EDS A or Timog or West Avenue, and signs beckon, neon lights blink out names in dicative of Filipino cooking: Barrio Fiesta (in screaming colors, with palayok on flickering flames), Kapis- tahan, Kawil, Pinausukan, Kamayan, Kamay-Kamayan Kainan, Lam- bat, Bakahan at Manukan (open 24 hours), Pancit ng taga Malabon (12 locations), Palaisdaan, Nandau, Dipag, Ang Luto ni Lola, Bahay Tikiman, Kusina ni Maria, Pook Luntian, Tigpaw, Ihaw-Ihaw, Paru- parong Bukid, Sinangag ATBP, Sariling Atin, Bahay Kawayan, Handaan sa Bicutan, etc. etc. — and who knows how many scores of others in highways and by ways, not listed in the phone book, which consciously choose names as native as possible to assure the diner that their cuisine is tunay na Pinoy. The snobbery has been reversed. Where for merly it was fashion¬ able to disguise one's native roots with a name that had echoes of \"class\" (e. g. Aristocrat, Selecta, Bungalow), now it is trendy to explore 200 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food the native lexicon and fish out a name that is for thrightly vernacular and has echoes of home cooking, of provincial specialties not found elsewhere, of native wild life and exotica. And who knows how many other native restaurants hide behind owners' proper names, like Jose¬ phine's (Cavite seafood) or Leo's (broiled seafood) or noncommittal • names like Grove? What happened to effect this change? Why is Filipino food sud¬ denly so available, fashionable, marketable? Why is the turo-turo, which one used to explain apologetically to to urists as \"point-point,\" quaint and provincial, suddenly mod and money-making? It has moved out of the markets into new restaurants, is being designed by in terior designers and frequented by the fashionable. Why is eating with the hands, the native way, which one was allowed to do only on picnics in the provinces (at our convent school we were obliged to for ego even the spoon and eat with fork and knife), suddenly in stitutionalized in res¬ taurants (with rows of clamshell-basins for handwashing), and being done in public by Makati types, many in expert and fumbling? The Reasons. The first factor in this new development was that more and more people were eating out in stead of at home (the rush of work, the density of traffic, the commuting distance, etc.). There was the refore more need for restaurants, and so more restaurants opened. The urbanization and in dustrialization of Metro Manila has created a different lifestyle for many. * For men, there is less time to go home for lunch (and hardly ever for a siesta), and of ten lunch has to be utilized for business meetings or even just for public relations (with someone owed favors, or from whom favors are expected). For women, there are now more job opportunities — from factory work to chambermaid jobs in the new hotels, to pro- - fessions and corporate positions for the highly trained. There are the refore fewer of them left at home to do the long, slow boiling, the patient mincing and stirring and coal-fanning, the etching of decorative designs on fruit to be cooked in syrup, the fattening of capons, even the training of househelp, that the women of old (especially the dear in dustrious old maid aunts) used to do. Furthermore, those who are left at home of ten have other work or little businesses or less time and have resorted to pressure cookers, ready-to-cook, ready-to-eat, the one-dish meal, the casserole, even rasyon, or cooked food bought on the way home. The second factor was the to urist drive"

The second factor was the to urist drive. If we plan to bring in to urists in droves in stead of trickles, we cannot for ever be explaining about Filipino food being available only in homes, or telling about but not showing the \"quaint\" turo-turo for fear of upsetting delicate Western stomachs with earthy Asian ways. There had to be places to take to urists to. Thus the Sulo Restaurant, one of the pioneers of the weekly Filipino buffet-cum-folk dancing; and Zamboanga, where giant The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila 201 buses disgorged Japanese to urists by the score, eager for lobsters and shrimps and prawns sea-fresh, but not in dishes too exotic for for eign palates (not sa gata, not in asiman, just steamed). The third factor came with the urbanization of lifestyles. Grow¬ ing away from provincial customs and Nanay's, Tiya's or Lola's cook¬ ing, with fewer fiestas to go home to, or less time to go home to them, the Manila urbanite began to develop a nostalgia for the good old days, which were concretely manifested in food: sinigang soured with guavas; kanduli cooked with miso and mustasa; lato, that translucent jade- green seaweed; fat alimango cooked in its own aligi; home-fattened capons cooked sitting up (pinaupo ) on beds of rock salt; even the regional specialties like kamaru from Pampanga, pinangat from Bicol and pancit Molo from Iloilo. For the Filipino, memories are very directly embodied in the food associated with events, places, even per¬ sons, and this he longed for in his urban maze. This nostalgia was seen in many newspaper and magazine arti¬ cles, in much news traded about that place in Sto. Tomas with the or iginal bulalo; and those sisters in Malabon with the real pancit Malabon; also those sisters in Calumpit who cooked ulang on or der; and those other sisters in Cavite whose oysters came fresh. (Amazing how many provincial restaurants are run by sisters, of ten in threes.) Even large corporations started planning their of fice parties barrio fiesta or \"sariling atm\" style, and good cooks from whom one could or der home cooking were in demand. The first few restaurants to venture to go all-Filipino were successful, and a chain reaction followed — all building on the urban Filipino's nostalgia for his culinary traditions, for the food of his heartland and his remembering. The fourth factor was probably and may still be unconscious. But with all the \"in ternationality\" of the restaurants in Metro Manila — Japanese restaurants by the score, Spanish (the best in the East), American (bolstered by the transnational fastfood in vasion), Swiss, Chinese (by the hundreds, at all cost levels), German, French, Italian, Middle Eastern, Thai, Mongolian, etc. — the Filipino restaurateur and/or entrepreneur realized that he had something different to of fer to this in ternational array, a product which could be at tractive to both for eign and local gourmand. Go national before going in ternational, he realized. Why should Filipino home cooking be confined to home and carinderia? And thus the Filipino restaurants of Manila proliferated. For one thing, it was easy to find good cooks for them, trained in homes and at fiestas, not needing training in hotel schools. For another thing, when the economic crunch came and imported foodstuff was hard to get or expensive, the local palengke was still there, reliable, abundant, ima¬ ginative. 202 Samp: Essays on Philippine Food The fifth reason for this proliferation was that the restaurants made money, drawing mostly local diners, and not only family groups and ladies' luncheons, but even corporate patronage, businessmen, catering.

Pinoy cuisine, it was found, could compete in the marketplace, and make it. The Types. The hundreds of Filipino restaurants in Metro Manila alone would be physically impossible to sample, but are possible to classify roughly. The first and most basic type, the most numerous in number, and certainly the one that cuts the greatest economic swath because it feeds the most people, is still the carinderia and its sub-type, the pondohan, or kainan ng mga tsuper. Do not underestimate this type, fan of Philippine cooking, because it is good, giving excellent value for the money since its clientele have little of the latter and yet have tastes honed exclusively to Filipino food. The pondohan are usually tables in the open or in sheds, to pped by rows of kaldero of different sizes, at or near bus, jeepney and taxi terminals and stops. They are in effect mini-carinderias since they have fewer dishes, but these in hearty portions at low prices. The food has to keep a man going, literally, since he is on the road for many hours, and so it is real pampabigat ng tiyan — sinigang na baboy, kare- kare, ginisang gulay, hearty helpings of rice and sabaw. The carinderia is best sampled in a marketplace, where it has a steady clientele among the vendors, customers, delivery boys, of fice and store workers from nearby. The Pampanga Kitchenette at Nepa Q- Mart, for example, is the size of a dry goods stall and consists of a back * wall and three sides of open counter, with an entrance for personnel breaking into one side. The counter-top has a two-layer eskaparate displaying menudo, adobo, kinilaw, bopiz, pastel (with out crust), sini¬ gang na baboy, binagoongang baboy, sinigang na bangus, nilagang baka, ginisang repolyo, ginisang ampalaya, dinuguan, etc. — depending on what's available in the market. On one side are the merienda makings — pancit, mami, halo-halo. Sabaw (hot, wonderfully soured sinigang broth) comes free with the ulam and rice one or ders. And if one fancies something in a neighboring stall, it is possible to call out and have it brought to one's base carinderia. The Pampanga Kitchenette, which has curtains decorating its back wall and ruffles fringing the shelves, is clean, with tableware washed in hot water. It is open from 4 a. m. (to service meat delivery men and food vendors) to 10 p. m. or midnight. The food is cooked in a restaurant across the street (same owner), and served all day, with nothing left by closing time. The pleasant girls selling get a minimal The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila 203 salary and their keep. The second type would be the straight-out commercial restaurant aimed at profiting from the middle-class market, the best example of which is the Barrio Fiesta chain. A success story from any angle, this started out with a simple for mula: feature two or three really popular dishes na dadayuhin ng tao. The or iginal restaurant had kare-kare, for merly unavailable in most restaurants, and crispy pata. The latter, not really a traditional native dish, is an adaptation, being boiled pata ng baboy fried crisp and eaten with a sawsawan. The English teacher in me used to rebel at the word crispy, which did not exist then, except in advertising jargon. However, because it does make the dish easier to pronounce (vs. \"crisp pata\"), it has since become part of our language and is in the dictionary as well. The Barrio Fiesta menu has since expanded along with the chain. Although the mass-produced food seems almost synthetic at times, the downhome flavor gone, the price range and menu still draw a certain in come group in droves, and so the kare-kare of all the Barrio Fiestas (available in take-home palayok) has the sweet taste of success. The owner has parlayed this into other restaurants — Probinsiya, Ihaw-Ihaw, Bakahan at Manukan — which success is able to support aggressive newspaper advertising (\"X varieties of bubbling bulalol\" \"The First and Only One of It's [sic] Kind!\") that focuses on what is unique to each restaurant and does not ment ion its belonging to a chain.

For Bakahan at Manukan, for example, it is lechong manok, wrapped in foil and cooked over coal in a large claypot, and bulalo. The or iginal bulalo, from Batangas and Laguna, is simply beef shin bones and knuckles (kenchi) given a long, slow, patient boiling (at least five hours) with only whole black pepper and rock salt. Simplicity itself, as many great things are. Bakahan at Manukan, however, lists at least ten kinds — e. g. bulalo steak, sizzling bulalo, etc. Ihaw-Ihaw advertises its specialty as in ihaw sa banga, \"our very fresh, juiciest foodstuffs broiled in side the banga (an earthenware oven used by the highlanders many centuries back),\" to quote its menu. Its adobong hito sa gata is cooked with ginger and greens in a bamboo tube stoppered with banana leaf. Although both are native cooking meth¬ ods that would be good to promote in urban areas, the quality of the product has been uneven. The chain restaurants, the refore, specifically the Barrio Fiesta chain, are successful because of: 1) aggressive advertising, made possible by their number; 2) the gimmick of each restaurant having a specialty aside from the staples; and 3) availability and accessibility. In a venture of this scale, however, it is obviously difficult to keep tight rein on quality. The prices are not low, but still reasonable 204 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food compared to hotel prices and those of more upscale restaurants, and thus draw a certain type of clientele — those less than picky, contented with edible Filipino dishes that fall within their budget. The third type would be the specialty restaurant. This is and should be the most in teresting type. To this category belong the restaurants that are actually unclassifiable because they are all different, in dividual, and build their patronage on a real specialty, something unique to them, be it a regional dish, a rarity, or a creative chef. At the top of this class is Rudy Siojo's Country Chef, the specialty of which is quite simply Rudy Siojo, owner and creative spirit. The cuisine at Country Chef is native, but cannot be found elsewhere. The fried pusit is spicy; the chicharron of chicken skin crisp and succulent (if you can imagine the precise combination); and both come with spinach leaves crisp-fried and melting. The bibingka is one of the best in town — flavored with white cheese and salted egg and made from real galapong (many of the bibingka of Manila come from mixes). We drive miles for it. Siojo's food is the kind you think you could do at home, but it is the farthest thing from pedestrian, and probably difficult to duplicate at home, considering the time and Hie in gredients needed to produce the real country flavor. To this type also belong the regional restaurants of which we have too few: Patio Mequeni, Cabalen, Trellis and Bistro Remedios, all Kapampangan; Ninay Pacita, Ilongo Visayan; Grove, Bicolano more or less; Nandau, Dipag and Kusina ni Maria, food of Zamboanga del Norte. Where are the Ilocano, Cebuano, Maranaw, Tausog, etc. res¬ taurants? When will we be able to sample, right in Metro Manila, the regional cuisines of legend? Right now, the Ilocanos will tell of a small restaurant with real kilawin, to which they promise to take you someday. The Pampangos have more specialty restaurants and even carinderias in the city, but swear they have to drive you to San Fernando for stuffed frog. The Ilongos apologize for the poor imitation of La Paz batchoy available at fast food stalls and suggest a visit to La Paz market in Iloilo. The Bikolanos frown at the in ferior or in authentic pinangat in restaurants and talk of the \"real thing\" in Camalig. The Warays, Cagayanons and others can only dream of home.

And there are others who may know how, but would The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila 205 rather not do so for laing and kaldereta, but only for alimango and sugpo. In the early days of the kamayan fad, a waiter at Kamayan Padre Faura answered our request for a spoon for the sinigang with: \"Di ba Kamayan ang pangalan nito? Di kailangan gumamit ng kamay\" — with out even a smile. People braved the house rules by bringing their own spoons and forks, so great was their desire to eat the home-type food. Now, however, the kamayan restaurants — Kamayan, Tito Rey, etc. — of fer a choice of hands or utensils or a combination. The gimmick has become an adjustment in the colonial mores: you can now eat native and native style at a proper restaurant, with social approbation and with out shame. A specialty restaurant of another stripe is Grove, which started out on M. H. del Pilar, moved to P. Burgos in Makati, and is now on one of Makati's \"food streets,\" Pasay Road. Grove's uniqueness lies in its buffet of 40-plus dishes, which in cludes: a host of appetizers like kilawing tanguingue, lumpiang prito, piniritong biya, ginataang kuhol, dilis na maanghang, etc.; a pride of vegetables like puso ng saging, gabi, nangka, to gue, the famous Bicol Express which is ginisang sili, and fresh relishes of mustard greens, radish and ampalaya; a brace of variety meats like bopiz, tinumis and dinuguan; a school of fish dishes like sinaing, sanglay (both wrapped in leaves, one banana, the other pechay), paksiw, sinigang, in ihazv, kinunot na pating, etc.; at least two soups like sinuwam na halaan and sinigang; meat dishes like paksiw na pata, pinatisang manok and binagoongang baboy; native desserts like gulaman at sago, ginataan and maja blanca; and fruits. It is undeniably a feast for those who cannot get used to the one-protein, one- vegetable American meal in stead of the maraming sari-sari Filipino meal; and a bargain for the matakaw. It brings to mind the bounty of provincial ancestral tables and fiestas, and that is its particular appeal. In this class too are the fish restaurants that cluster on the lakeshore at Bicutan, which of fer dalag, kanduli and hito in various preparations, and all kinds of char-broiled fish like pla-pla, kitang, pampano and bangus. Pinausukan has a wide assortment of dishes, but is known for the Davao in ihaw na panga, the jaw of the yellow-fin tuna, rejected by canneries, but broiled to ambrosia on the Davao shore. Here too belong the \"narrow specialty\" restaurants like Bangus, which has bangus in all forms, in cluding the vaunted \"prime cuts\" — six tiyan ng bangus sinigang, or cooked in kalamansi, toyo and on ion rings.

Thus each hotel dining room or specialty restaurant lists some Filipino dishes and all the hotel coffee shops of fer native meriendas like suman, arroz caldo and halo-halo at dollar price ranges, which connoisseurs pronounce \"not as good as the ones in Central Market.\" The native dishes are, after all, not the primary concern of these restaurants since they are there mainly to provide local color. Undeniably, some of these hotel restaurants do serve rather good Filipino food. At the Peninsula's Old Manila, the smoked tanguingue (since copied by everyone, but a pioneer in vention of the Pen) is a creative way of thinking about local fish. It is served with dill sauce, lemon and capers, and is excellent. The Filipino dishes change with each menu revision, but in clude such dishes as Manok sa Gata, Batangas Adobo (liver, chicken and pork), Kalderetang Kambing and an authen¬ tic Kari-karing Buntot. Which then, we are in evitably asked, is the best Filipino res¬ taurant in Manila? Mahirap sabihin, ika nga. Difficult to say, because one cannot compare restaurants of different types since they have different assumptions, budgets, aims, standards, audiences. Where then would be the best place to take your visiting Balikbayan friend? 1 would say the carinderia, if he is still flexible and has a sense of humor, because that is native food with its feet on the ground (on native soil — sometimes literally); and to the specialty restaurant, if he has lived too long in the US and has to have the amenities of air-con¬ ditioning, uniformed waiters and freshly starched table linen if he is not to have a fit. Where should one take the to urist? It depends on the catholicity of his tastes, the strength of his digestion and his sense of adventure. If he has the standard preconceptions and fears, do please take him to (or better still leave him in) a hotel. There is one type of Filipino restaurant still a-borning, and the refore rare — the type that cooks Filipino food as well and as The Filipino Restaurants of Metro Manila 207 carefully, and serves it as graciously as it is served in a Filipino home of the ilustrado class. Philippine cooking has barely gotten out of the \"dirty kitchen\" stage and into the restaurant arena.

Such dishes as Jamon Sulipena con Fruta and Pistou Sulipan are now served alongside dishes derived from Western cuisines or of Gene's own in vention. The Chaine des Rotisseurs, the gourmet society that dates its ancestry to 1248, has had several diners amicales at which Filipino food has been served with the flair and grace usually reserved for European cuisine.

It will have a further epiphany when more creative cooks enrich the tradition, and other imaginations think about serving it as it deserves, thus elevating it to \"world class\" and not relegating it only to not-quite- first-class restaurants. A restaurant of this type would bring our cuisine not only out \"in public\" but to the eyes of the world. No cuisine need be bound to its traditions because the dynamism of a living culture (and what could be more lively than food?) demands growth, a reaching upward and outward from the roots. This should not, however, be mere gimmickry, like serving bulalo on a sizzling platter — what for? It should be a sincere and in telligent reflection on the ethos of Philippine food, on its materials, its history, its spirit. It should entail research into traditions so that from there one can take off, in vent, recombine, rethink, repackage, revive, create. A restaurant of this type would require creative chefs, daring restaurateurs and money. One is faced with the reality that few Filipinos will be able to afford such a restaurant. Strictly speaking, it is not a necessity, especially in a developing country, where the im¬ portant point about food is that it be available to the majority.

The truth is, most of them are fairly healthy. Eating directly off the environment also means using cooking methods that require the least expense, i. e. minimal use of store-bought condiments, such as black pepper or garlic, and no frying, as lard has to be bought. In short, nosauteeing, much less anything more elaborate than that. Much of a peasant's food is transformed from its natural state to the \"cooked\" (ready to be eaten) by boiling and broiling: dinengdeng, Poor Man's Fare 211 bulanglang, pakbet, in ihaw, sinigang. He takes in a lot of salt (as salt or as bagoong) to replace the salt lost when he sweats as he works. The peasant's diet consists mainly of vegetables, which he does not preserve since they are readily available in his backyard or in the fields. He produces an abundance only if he in tends to sell his surplus. Otherwise he gets them from his own fence or plot or his neighbor's. Rice is his main fare, but this he in sists must be newly cooked and piping hot. Rice is best accompanied by dishes which have broth, yung may sabaw. And these too he prefers temperature hot. This preference is dictated by our tropical climate. One of his pleasures is derived from sweating while eating, for perspiration has a cooling effect. One knows easily when the peasant/laborer is satisfied with his meal — he pulls up his shirt to expose his stomach to the breeze, or takes his shirt off altogether. He eats with his hands. \"Mas masarap,\" he says. The type of rice we eat partly dictates the way we eat. If we raised the Japonica variety which is sticky, we would be using chopsticks in stead. Soup we don't take by spoonfuls, but in sips. Ang sabaw ay hinihigop. Solid is taken as solid (rice plus viand) and then after a few \"dry\" mouthfuls we vary it with a warm, liquid wash-down. It is the hat broth which actually warms the body. Sabaw (hot, of course) is an in stitutional part of his meal, such that in pondohan taxi drivers or walk-ins always ask for sabaw, which is usually given free. Fast food counters would put this in the category of soup, and charge extra. The free-of-charge sabaw is really just broth. Walang laman. Eateries which give sabaw free cater to the lower class; this is an in fallible in dex of a shop's clientele. II I grew up in the periphery of a small town. Across our street was the back of the church, which occupied a hectare bounded by acacias, sampalok and a tiny lake. Across the side street of our house was the house of Ka Ino, a carpenter. His wife, Ka Andang, sold pancit and balikutsa (tira-tira) to primary schoolchildren from the Gabaldon schoolhouse just across their hut. Their children were my playmates. About three hundred meters from our houses the road ended in a thin bamboo grove. Across that were rice fields, a small watering hole for carabaos (a lubluban really), a few hundred square meters of sugarcane field, and then a mango grove. My father grew up in Manila and ate very few vegetables: to mato, kamote tops, eggplant. My maternal grandmother cooked for us, and she planned our meals around my father's preferences, which were very unexciting — mostly prito and sinigang. My mother grew up in a barrio of that town. She always preferred vegetables to other food, all kinds 212 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food of vegetables, so my grandmother always prepared dinengdeng and pakbet. My father never quite understood how my mother could have dinengdeng for breakfast and buggoong (bagoong) with all her meals. Summer was the most adventurous part of my childhood. With Ka Ino's children, I would roam the grassy ground at the back of the church and with bamboo slats in our hands we would catch grasshoppers, remove their legs and wings, and eat their bodies. Near the carabaos' mud pool we would look for a mound of old, dried-up carabao dung, in vert it, scratch out a tiny, shallow hole, and light it. After much effort we would get no fire, only an ember glow which we had to keep alive by blowing.

We would put our catch on this and have freshly broiled, newly-caught grasshoppers — charcoal-bitter on the outside, marshmallow-mushy in side. A hint of the sweetness of newly-cut soft grass. There were summers of many grasshoppers, yet somehow our stomachs were never upset. It must have been the thin crust of charcoal that protected us from our greed. The first rain brought us food which abounded for only a few days. There would suddenly be swarms of winged white ants flying to ward the electric bulb on our street corner. We would carry batya of water on our heads, stand beneath the bulb, brush away the ants which would alight on our faces, our shoulders, our arms, and somehow manage to play jak-em-poy. The gossamer wings of the ants, which had hibernated underground during the dry season, would fill the surface of our batya. We would scoop these away and there beneath were the wriggling fat ants. Ka Andang would to ast them in a pan till they were wet-crisp on the outside and milk-succulent in side. At the same time, with the first rain came the salagubang. We would all be busy climbing trees, picking them literally like flowers, and those beyond our reach we would still be able to get — by shaking the tree branches and boles. We would tie threads around the June beetles at the bases of their wings, and swing them around in circles, to make them fly. We would also make them fight; the first salagubang to fall on its back was the loser. But there would always be so many of them, and we only needed a few to play with. The rest would find their way to the frying pan. Their wings would be wrenched off; they would then be drowned in vinegar, salt and pepper, then transferred to the pan and dry-sauteed with garlic. They were taken whole, chewed, and the pulp thrown away. The salagubang is crunchy and tastes like soft- to-medium boiled fish roe — rather delicious. Ill Then there are mole crickets (ar-arawan to Ilocanos; kamaru to the Kapampangan). After a few days of continued rain the fields are plowed, and in the drizzle the peasants dance on the mud, out of which Poor Man's Fare 213 the crickets wriggle, tickling the soles of their feet. The kamaru are later washed and cooked in a little vinegar and seasoning, sort of adobado, then fried to a moist crispness. Its taste is close to that of a boiled eggyolk, a bit finer on the outside and a bit rougher on the in side. After weeks of rain the croaking of frogs would fill the nights. Before that, beneath the grasses at the edge of the small lake behind the church there would be a tizzy of activities: white foam would appear, then turn yellowish, and tadpoles would appear. In a few weeks Ka Andang would be by the lake during and after school hours, armed with a bamboo pole and line, a can of chopped earthworms which she had dug up nearby and a basket for her catch. She would fish for frogs with the earthworms as bait, and she would have extra in come for the season. Ka Andang made a soup of frog meat and kalabasa leaf sprouts with a few kalabasa flowers thrown in for color — frog tinola. My father would take the frogs only adobado, cooked exactly the way chicken and pork adobo are prepared. Ka Andang would sometimes treat us to frogs' legs, fried after having been marinated in vinegar, salt, pepper and garlic. We could never have a feast, though, because she preferred selling the frogs she caught for cash. Frog meat has the tastiness of chicken. It has to be eaten with the hands because of the tiny bones, and that adds to its savor. It is like eating pakwan or kalabasa seeds — just morsels, and so one is never sated. At night frog-catchers would use kalburo lamps. The frogs would be transfixed by the lamps' glare and so they could easily be speared with a rigid wire. Most of these were sold by the wives, like K a Andang, in the town's public market. Neighbors had first option, though. Often frogs were bartered or used to pay off what had been in for mally borrowed or loaned. In fact, there was always a history of reciprocal relations in terms of food exchange in our neighborhood"

Exchanges in volved mostly goods which had not been bought and had not assumed a monetary value. These would be goods available in one's yard, like malunggay leaves, fruit, or kamote tops; or those in seasonal abundance, like winged white ants or harvests from the fields such as beans. Only during parties was cooked food exchanged. Lastly, the rainy season meant an abundance of gurami, dalag, hito and suso from the rice fields. Farmers hardly used fertilizers then, and the rains woke the fish up from hibernation. Since there would suddenly be a big supply, my grandmother and Ka Andang would help each other pack and ferment them in dark grey jars (burnay) as buro. From the jars would come a supply of fish during the dry months. They had not been bought and were never sold, being meant only for family consumption — at most for sharing with neighbors. Ka Andang preferred eating burong isda with newly-gathered 214 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food A mustard leaves. Thus Ka Ino always saw to it that there were a few mustard plants in their backyard. She would saute her buro first, then wrap it in a crisp and mildly pungent mustard leaf. My grandmother did hers with out frills. Just a simple passage through the frying pan and this became the sawsawan for boiled eggplants. Of course, all our neighbors knew when we were having buro, as they would be having the irs at the same time. IV ’ <)' There are other special delicacies which are regarded as occa¬ sional treats like honey, quail (pugo — eggs and meat), snakes (eggs and meat), civet cat (musang ), iguana (bayazvak). The whole year the earth, the bamboo groves, the tall grasses, the trees of fer food. Neces¬ sarily, the cycle is agricultural, seasonal more exactly. The peasant is still a hunter/ food-gatherer. What he tends in his backyard he shares with his neighbors or sells. Children grow up playing games of hunting and food gathering. This is one reason they do not suffer from severe malnutrition. (Seven grasshoppers have the equivalent nutrients of a leg of chicken.) The surroundings are bountiful, protein-laden, vitamin- rich. Bemabe Buscayno, also known as Kumander Dante, testifies to the healthiness of peasant upbringing. He is wiry and hardly gets sick. \"My health must be due to those years of eating directly from the soil, from the environment,\" he at tests. As a typical child in a typical bar¬ rio, he took care of his family's one carabao. There was so much time, time while the carabao was grazing, time too for playing. Many games were connected with food. The children would throw frogs into the fire, which struggled awhile, and then were eaten. \"Parang litson,\" he says. They would fill empty sardine cans (Rose Bowl brand, he recalls) with the shoots of beans, squash, or whatever was available, to boil and eat. Fish and shellfish were plentiful in the rice fields. Pugo, he says, is caught by running around and around it in a tightening circle. The bird stands transfixed, getting dizzy, its eyes rolling round and round, and one only has to catch it (dakma ) with one's hand. Quail eggs they took raw. Snake eggyolks are translucent, the eggs like rubber, difficult to break but very delicious. \"Yun lang, sa mainit na kanin, ang sarap-sarap na.\" When he was older, Dante says they would go to the mountains nearby and catch iguana. The female bayawak, he says, has two va¬ ginas and two sets of ovaries, one on the left and one on the right, and each one could have a dozen eggs. The male of course has two penises and walks upright on its tail (this and the two hind legs for ming a stable triangle), and it is easy to find for it leaves two furrows — the penises' trail. Iguana tastes like chicken meat — \"puti ang laman, mas Poor Man's Fare 215 malinamnam.\" The iguana population does not in crease because the mother-iguana eats its own newly-hatched babies, only a few escaping their predatory mother.

As long as there are enough patches of wilderness for in sects and birds and animals to breed in, there is enough free protein for the peasants. V The in troduction of the IRRI (International Rice Research Insti¬ tute) hybrid, high-yield rice varieties in creased our rice production. However, it also necessitated the massive use of chemical fertilizers, in secticides and pesticides. These poisoned the rice fields, and they have been so polluted that hito, dalag and frogs have been wiped out of them. These and kuhol now have to be cultured like tilapia and carp. Peasant children now have fewer food games to play; their source of free protein has shrunk. Surely, the number of malnourished peasant children is in creasing. The change in the mode of rice production (the shift to tractors, the lessening utilization of carabaos, the need to buy even seedlings), i. e. the gradual mechanization of farming and the in creasing expense for farm in puts tie the farmer to the capitalist market. If he has cash he uses it for his farm needs, for a hectare planted to rice requires between P 4000 and P 5000. Add to this the diminishing of costless food sources, and one can see how the growing generations of peasants as well as urban in dustrial blue-collar workers are converging to wards the in evitable zone of mal- nourishment. The reason is simple: both are tiid to the cash continually decreasing, then the amount of food he is able to buy also decreases gradually. This is in dicated by the proliferation of stalls which sell cheap food: the barbecued in nards of chicken, pig's blood, pig's ears, day-old chicks, lugaw. They have become a fixture where a critical mass gathers at certain times of the day — markets, bus stops, even shopping areas like SM at EDSA. Such street food can now be seen in to wns with large populations, such as in the plaza and public markets of Malolos and San Fernando (both Pampanga and La Union). They have made their appearance in Tarlac, Tarlac. When they appear in Victoria, Tarlac, then it could be said that an encompassing national poverty has truly gripped an entire country. As of now patches of green and slivers of healthy rivers still ensure protein with out cost to the peasant. The rate of our population growth, however, is alarming. 216 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food / ). VI My father, who grew up in the slums of Manila, never ate kuhol and kangkong. He said he knew where they came from — fields across what used to be Washington Street (now Maceda). Dapitan Street slopes up to ward Mayon, and the depression is where kangkong used to be grown. Kuhol thrived in the same fields, in which slum dwellers used to throw their refuse. Thus his aversion. Kangkong was never grown in the farm where my Ilocano mother grew up. Kuhol was, however, bountiful in the rice fields. She has no aversion for vegetables and kuhol. Rural farms were clean, i. e. unpollu¬ ted sources of food. My parents' food preferences were also conditioned by their eco¬ nomic status. My father grew up on cheap food like fresh alamang and galunggong, and fruit like mango, which to his family was ulam. Meat, especially beef, was occasional fare. He liked sinigang and pesa — yung masabaw. There were more than ten children in his family, and soup was a food extender.

None of my children grew up in Victoria so none of them eat winged white ants or kamaru, much less salagubang. Peasant food changes very little. The rural environment remains basically the same as it was four, five decades ago. The farmers hardly migrate. If they do, it is to an environment similar to that in which they grew up — Isabela, Cagayan, or Mindanao. Peasant food is thus kept traditional by the unchanging economic condition of the peasant — poverty. For the urban laborer too, in come dictates food choices. Since vegetables are cheapest, he eats a lot of them. Even fish has become occasional fare for him. Meat, even chicken, has become a rarity. He lives on chicken in nards, chicken feet, or chicken combs as protein source. Most eat lugaw so only a sprinkling of tuyo or sardines is needed. Just a hint. There are certainly more malnourished children in urban areas than in the rural regions for in the latter there are alternative sources — malunggay trees can be planted, kalabasa and kamote can be grown. Poor Man's Pare 217 VII Peasant food has, however, travelled upwards as exotic food (kamaru is available at Rudy's Country Chef, Cabalen, Patio Mequeni, Bistro Remedios — all in Metro Manila) or regular fare (bulalo, dinengdeng). Most middle-class fast food restaurants carry at least one vegetable dish — monggo, ampalaya, puso ng saging. The addition of shrimps or pork and a small change in the manner of cooking (sauteeing rather than boiling) enables poor man's food to go middle class. The unabated in flation continues to decrease the purchasing power of the peso. The ranks of the poor have swelled. Government em¬ ployees, especially those covered by civil service rules and/or WAPCO, live below the poverty line. The socio-economic research or ganization IBON estimated the daily cost of living for a family of six at PI 19 as of a year ago. Even if we put the annual in flation rate at a low six percent, one would now need at least PI 25 daily. Even if only 50 percent of that is spent for food, it means a food budget of P 62.50 every day. No wonder at least 70 percent of our national population suffers below the poverty line. With 1978 or ten years ago as base year, the peso now has a purchasing power of only P 0.27. So unless one's in come has in creased by 73 percent in that period one would be for ced to eat less meat, less fruit, less snacks. Certainly the wages of the urban worker and the in come of the peasant have remained way below their needs. Notice that although a family of six needs P 62.50 daily to survive, the daily wage of agricultural workers is P 47.21 in plantations and P 36 in non-planta¬ tions; whereas those of nonagricultural workers in Metro Manila is P 57-.83 and outside of it P 56.75. This explains the proliferation of street food. More are poorer. More have to eat cheap, i. e. peasant, food. Or to put it another way, the clientele of poor man's food is in creasing. Cheap ihaw-ihaw and lugaw are fixtures in the public markets of Metro Manila. Now even of fice employees eat in dingy shops which only jeepney and taxi drivers used to patronize. The lower class has expanded. Logically, lower class food has more customers. Correspondingly, poor man's fare, the repertory of cheap food, has in creased in number and variety. Take lugaw. A bowl of plain lugaw beside Nepa-Q-Mart costs P 2. The addition of a raw egg raises the price to P 3.50. If one asks for laman (usually a dangkal of tripa), one has to pay P 6. The house specialty is mata ng baka, which raises the cost to P 7 a bowl. Notice too the bot¬ tling of Coca-Cola. The company has gone tingi. There is Solo, 125 ml., 250 ml., 500 ml., and litro. It (\"Coke is It\") is now highly parcelized, where in the US it has gone the opposite way — into large party-size plastic bottles. If our in flation rates continue, we may soon be drinking Coke in Yakult-bottle sizes. 218 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food The poor, however, hardly drink soda pop.

They quench their thirst with sa malamig (or ange-, pineapple-, sago-, buko-flavored drinks) which cost only PI a glass. It is a much better drink really to wash down day-old chicks or barbecued chicken in testines. Since soft drinks are carbonated, they cause one to burp. With sa malamig, what one has eaten goes down placidly. Unlike soft drinks, they are hardly placed in plastic or vinyl containers since that means extra cost for the vendor. They are served in coffee-bottle glasses, which are then rinsed out in water. The serving of soft drinks in plastic bags — with a straw of course — is a Third World phenomenon. This saves on the bottle • deposit. San Miguel Corporation has also made corresponding changes in its marketing strategies. San Miguel beer is now available in different sizes: Miguelito, the traditional pint size, and Grande. SMC also of fers other brands such as Gold Eagle and Red Horse. The poor man's favorites, though, remain gin and rum. For him. Coke and beer are party fare. Notice that in contrast to Coke and San Miguel beer there have not been any changes in the bottling strategies of gin and rum. They have always been the poor man's bottled drinks. Of course, the cheapest are tuba, lambanog and basi. But only tuba is available in quantity and somehow only the Southern Tagalogs and the Visayans have taken to it. VIII Since the Filipino meal is rice-based, the peasants, or the poor especially, use extenders. For most, this is bagoong which could be made of fish, roe, shrimp, or the flesh of shellfish (e. g. oysters in Catba- logan, Samar). The idea is to preserve these in salt, of ten in the form of a paste or sauce, depending on the viscosity. However, it could be dry, like the chunks of shrimp guinamus sold in the Silay City (Negros Occidental) market, where one buys them in cubes, slices, even chupa and ganta sizes. Bagoong can be eaten as ulam. Or it can serve as sawsawan for vegetables, fish, meat or any other kind of ulam. In Surigao it is the sawsawan for boiled green sab a; in Bulacan for chicharrong baboy. As sawsawan it can be by itself or it can have a little vinegar or kalamansi added, or it can be mixed with sour fruit such as kamias or green mango. Of course it can be a sawsawan for food not necessarily eaten with rice, like sliced green mango. Food with which the peasant uses bagoong as sawsawan is usually boiled (e. g. eggplants) or broiled (e. g. dalag or hito). Somehow bagoong does not go well with fried food, much less with anything sauteed. Bagoong is also used to make broth salty. It is a must with dinengdeng and pakbet, that is, with vegetable stews. Poor Man's Pare 219 In Luzon those with cash surplus would buy patis. But patis is used only by the Tagalogs and those who live near them, like the Kapam- pangans and Bicolanos. Ilocanos hardly use patis. In the Visayas patis is unknown. There toyo (which is called patis, patis being \"patis Tagalog\") is preferred. To the Muslims patis is also a stranger. Patis most probably came from southern China and became a part of the cuisine of those parts of the Philippines where there were Chinese settlements, or where there was a long period of in tercourse with the native Malays. The Bicolanos are said to use sili extensively or preponderantly since it serves as food extender. The Bicol peninsula has a relatively high rainfall. In Sorsogon it drizzles every afternoon even during sum¬ mer. Humidity is high. Sili makes one sweat and sweat has a cooling effect. Bagoong has a different mechanism. It replenishes the body salt lost during strenuous work. Salt comes out of the body as part of sweat and because we live in the tropics, even simple exposure to the sun causes us to sweat. The flexing of muscles is of ten accompanied by sweating. Thus there is more bagoong consumption among the laboring class. From the middle class upwards, bagoong is treated not as ulam or extender but as sawsawan. It is not only the lack of cash surplus that binds the poor to bagoong, but also the need to replenish the body salt lost through extensive physical exertion"

From the middle class upwards, bagoong is treated not as ulam or extender but as sawsawan. It is not only the lack of cash surplus that binds the poor to bagoong, but also the need to replenish the body salt lost through extensive physical exertion. Since bagoong is made from fish (and its entrails, e. g. the Zamboanga del Norte dayok), roe, shrimp, oysters or other shellfish, it is found all over the Philippines, especially in places close to the sea. Mountain tribes do not have it, nor is their cooking dependent on bagoong. 1 ' N IX For the poor, every little possibility helps. What is available, try. What is possible, explore. Availability and possibility are thus the grid of choices. Nutrition is not a consideration. Food should be filling. The stomach must not growl. One must have the energy for physical work. And the earth continues to replenish itself. Mole crickets, winged white ants, salagubang still abound in those first few days of the year's first rain. The rivers still have shrimps and crayfish; the streams, fish and shells. Possibilities abound close by. Rice — that is what must be bought, not viands. Rice is the immovable core of the grid. But around that are possibilities seemingly endless: fruit is treated as ulam; flowers (katuray, alucon) are vegetables; in sects are alimentation in their different stages — egg, larva, adult; raw milk on rice is a treat; the viscera of fish, fowl, mammals are delicacies, as are the skin, eyes, the whole face of animals. The list is endless. \\ 220 Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food And the motivation is not greed. It is survival: the fact that hunger must be kept at bay. The need to eat in or der to replenish one's energy, in or der to grow, in or der to function, is met by what is available. Geography (archipelagic), climate (tropical) and cash surplus determine the poor man's food choices. Since he has little cash for food, his choices are more elemental than those of his upscale countrymen. He is bound more tightly to geography and climate. These are the very factors which in fluence his culture — and his tradition, especially his belief system, which is part of culture, and becomes itself a force. Being bound tightly to soil and water, and having very little cash, if any, the peasant avails himself of these resources directly. From soil to cooking pan; from stream to stove. Very little by way of garnishing. The resources of nature are left tasting very much as they do in their natural state. Ihaw is what peasants do. lhaw-ihaw is how the middle class has transformed that peasant way: basically ihaw but with such in novations as marinades and dips. There is no \"prito-prito\" since from the very start frying has been middle class. Ihaw, if it needs any sawsawan at all, would require only bagoong or suka, singly or in combination. The peasant respects the natural taste of food. He regards that, in fact, as the basis for sarap. Fish should taste like fish, but not be fishy or malansa. Souring of ten removes that, thus sinigang is made with what panuka are readily available — to matoes, santol, guavas, mangoes, kamias, dahon ng sampalok. Insects should taste like in sects. And of course vegetables retain their taste when eaten singly, like in ihaw na talong or in ihaw na ampalaya, or in combination, like dinengdeng. Since the food is little transformed, it retains not only natural taste but also its latent nutritive value. Severe malnutrition has only been reported in the sugar plantations of Negros, and there it was the result of economic dislocation caused by the drop of world sugar prices, and the sugar monopoly in stituted by the Marcos regime. It is the refore caused by human reasons, not by geography or climate. Since the poor are not bound to money, they are more free, in a sense — freer to explore the products of geography and climate. The poor in urban areas are trapped in the cash economy and thus have less to explore than those outside of it. They have resorted to the conversion of food discards into food objects, e. g. the in testines, combs and feet of chickens. The same principle was at work — avail on eself of what is there, explore the possibilities — and the same motivation — the immediate and constant need to eat"

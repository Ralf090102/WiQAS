      "context": "The Monkeys and the Butterflies DEEP IN A FOREST in Agusan lived many monkeys and but- terflies. They gave no trouble to each other, for while the monkeys ate the fruits of the for est trees, the but terflies drank the nectar from the flowers. But one day the monkeys decided to kill the but terflies. “This is our for est,” they said. “We want no but terflies around.” So they picked up sticks and marched to the glade where the but terflies were flitting about from flower to flower and sipping sweet nectar. There were white but ter- flies and black but terflies. There were red but terflies, yellow but terflies, or ange but terflies, and but terflies of mixed colors. The meadow looked very gay with so many but terflies flitting among the flowers. The monkeys rushed upon the but terflies and began hit- ting them with their sticks. The but terflies fell one by one, and soon only one but terfly remained. © This last but terfly flew to the top of a tree where the monkeys could not reach her. “What could my people have done to make the monkeys so angry with us?” she thought. “We have stolen nothing from them, and we have never given them any trouble. All we have done is drink nectar from the flowers. Unless we do this, the flowers will not produce seeds, and if there are no seeds, soon there will be no trees. Then the monkeys will have no fruits to eat.” The 73 but terfly grew angry and added: “I will avenge the death of my people.” She flitted down and hovered just beyond the reach of the monkeys. The monkeys saw her and said, “This is the last of the but terflies. Let us kill her and finish our job.” They tried to reach her with their sticks and said, “Come nearer and we will give you a nice whack!” To their surprise, the but terfly came closer to the ground. She flew quickly about and alighted on the fore- head of the largest monkey. “Kill me if you can!” she shouted. The monkeys raised their sticks and tried to hit her"

She flew quickly about and alighted on the fore- head of the largest monkey. “Kill me if you can!” she shouted. The monkeys raised their sticks and tried to hit her. But when they looked again, they found that the but terfly had darted off and alighted on the head of the next largest monkey. The other monkeys raised their sticks again and tried to hit the but terfly. But just as before, the but terfly darted off quickly and alighted on the head of the next largest monkey. This went on and on, and as the but terfly flew from one monkey’s head to another, the monkeys tried all the harder to hit her. They were so in terested in trying to hit the but terfly that they did not see they were growing fewer and fewer. Only the but terfly saw that every monkey she alighted on was killed by the blows the other monkeys meant for her. “Kill me if you can!” she challenged them, and more monkeys were killed. At last only one monkey remained. He was very tired trying to hit the but terfly. He stood ona rock breathing hard. The but terfly alighted on a leaf and said to him, “Please put down your stick. I would like to have a nice talk with you.” The monkey dropped his stick and said, “What do you wish?” “As you can see,” replied the but terfly, “you are the last monkey in the for est. And I am the last but terfly, too.” The monkey nodded. “Now, we but terflies have never done you monkeys any harm,” the but terfly went on. “We are not like the 74 mosquitoes who sting you or the fleas who bite you day and night. We only drink nectar from the flowers, and that harms nobody. On the other hand, if we do not carry pollen from one flower to another, no seeds will grow, and if there are no seeds, very soon you monkeys will have no fruit to eat"

His city stood beside a dark for est in habited by witches. This king and the leader of the witches were bitter foes, and the witch-leader decided to fight his enemy by means of a wicked plan. The king of the city had a handsome son named Ukay. Hunting in the woods one day, Ukay met a pretty maiden.

He fell in love with her, not knowing that she was the witch-leader’s daughter and she was herself a witch. Ukay and the witch-maiden of ten secretly met in the woods, and in time he found out who she was. But so greatly did he admire her good looks that he was quite willing to for get that she was a witch. He could not marry her, however, for he was not brave enough to tell his father she was a witch. The days went by. Ukay’s father was getting old and he saw that Ukay had grown to be a young man. So he de- cided that Ukay should get himself a wife. “There are many fair maidens in my kingdom, Son,” said he. “Why don’t you choose one of them and marry her?” Ukay looked at his father sadly and shook his head. “I am sorry I cannot marry a girl from the city,” he replied. “What's wrong with the girls from this beautiful city?” the king wanted to know. “I have watched them pass before the palace gates, and they are all very pretty.” 80 “I am very sorry, Father,” repeated Ukay, “but I just cannot marry a girl from the city.” The years rolled by and still Ukay did not marry. Nor did he tell his father that he had given his love to a witch. At length the king, who wanted to be sure that his line would continue, gathered the maidens in his kingdom to gether and told his son to choose his wife from among them. But Ukay refused to choose. At last the king lost his temper and himself picked out the fairest of the maidens. “I or der you to marry this maiden,” said he. Rather than make his father angry, Ukay bowed to his will and promised to wed the king’s choice. The witch-maiden heard of this and became furious"

He did not let you choose the woman you wanted to marry.” “For this,” she added, her eyes flashing with hatred, “you and your people shall suffer. Your city shall become a wilderness. Your father and your people shall become beasts. And you yourself shall become a monkey. You shall live high up in a tree, and a monkey you shall be until a beautiful maiden learns to love you more than she loves herself.” 81 So saying, she returned to the dark for est. No sooner had she turned her back than the proud city became a wild for est. The king and all his subjects were changed into lizards, snakes, wild pigs, jungle fowl, croco- diles, and other animals of the for est. Also, just as the witch had said, Ukay became a monkey. He climbed up into a tree and said nothing but “Kra-kra-kra!” all day long. The years dragged on one by one and Ukay and his people remained in their animal forms. The neighboring kingdoms wondered greatly why a for est had so quickly covered the famous city. Two centuries passed, three centuries, and the great city was for gotten.

He realized that though he had lived so long, his life as an animal was not at all so in teresting as his short life as a man had been. One day the monkey prince caught a maiden in the woods and carried her off to his tree. He was very polite and gentle to her, but in stead of falling in love with him, she grew ill with fright and soon died. The same thing happened to another maiden he captured soon after. The people heard about these things and avoided the for est al- to gether. “There is a terrible monster in this for est,” they whispered to one another. Four hundred years passed, then four hundred and fifty. One morning a beautiful maiden entered the for est with eyes filled with tears. Her lover had for saken her and married the daughter of a rich man. So she had come into the woods to die. She sat at the foot of Ukay’s tree lament- ing her sad fate. “I want to die, OI want to die!” she wailed, her head bent down to her breast. Quietly Ukay climbed down and took her tenderly by her hand. The maiden was so heart-broken that she did not 82 mind him. She did not even notice him carry her up into the tree. But when he spoke to her, she opened her eyes and saw him, and she jumped up in terror. She screamed and shrieked till the for est rang with her voice, but she had no way to escape. She had come to the for est to die, but now that she could have leaped to her death, she was more in terested in saving her life than in ending it.

His face, too, though hairy, resembled a man’s, and she felt a little sympathy for him. At last she stopped screaming and shrieking altogether and sat quietly on a branch of the tree. Then the monkey of fered her a ripe banana. She did not take it, but he held it out to her with so much pleading in his sad eyes that at last she accepted the banana. She took a small bite and found it good. She took another bite and then another until she had eaten the whole fruit. The monkey gave her another banana and she ate that, too. Then she sat looking into the monkey’s eyes and admir- ing him even more. The days passed and her admiration changed into love. Finally her love for him was more than her love for herself. She awoke from a long slumber on the afternoon of the tenth day to find the tree completely gone. She also found herself in a beautiful palace. The strange monkey was gone too, and a handsome young prince lay asleep near at hand. The prince soon woke up, kissed her fervently, and told her the wonderful story of his life.

His house was built ina tall tree, and it was made of sticks, straw, and feathers. His skin was covered with sores. He lived by trapping wild chickens and was so poor that he had to wear a coat made of chicken feathers. He would set his traps early in the morning and visit them before sundown. Since no other hunter lived in the for est, he easily managed to snare wild fowls. One day, on visiting his traps as usual, he found them all empty. He was surprised because many of the traps had been sprung. Again he found his traps empty next day, and he grew suspicious, for not only were the traps sprung as before but fresh feathers also lay near them. So on the third day he concealed himself in a bush hard by his traps. He had not long to wait, for soon several wild chickens were caught in the traps. Then a large rat and a large snake came along and quietly took the chickens from the traps. The man jumped out and ran after the thieves. He caught them as they were about to enter a hole under a tree. “You must pay with your lives for your thieving,” he said, raising his bolo. Then the rat and the snake spoke and said, “Please 84 spare our lives and we will give you magic power.” “What magic power?” he asked. The rat held out three strands of hair, and in its mouth the snake held out three clean feathers. “Take these,” they said. “You only have to rub them on the dead to bring them back to life,” The man took the feathers and hair and said, “T will spare your lives if you promise never to rob my traps again.” _ “We promise and thank you,” said the rat and the snake. “We will always remember your kindness.” Now the village chief had a beautiful daughter whom he loved so much that he did not want to marry her off early"

He saw the dead princess and knew of nothing else to do but rub against her skin the hair and feathers the rat and the snake had given him. She stood up, opened her eyes, smiled, and began speaking as if nothing had happened. Then the man realized that he might cure himself with the magic hair and feather, too. He to uched his sores with them and immediately his skin became all clean, and he stood as handsome as a prince from a great kingdom. Of course he married the princess, and they lived happily ever after. 87 The Monkey Who Became a Servant MASOY LIVED on a small clearing beside a for est in the Eastern Visayas. He raised fruits, beans, and ginger. Every morning he would go to the village to market his products, and with the money he got he would buy rice and other things for his daily needs. In this way he lived happily, envying no one. But early one morning when he went to his or chard to gather fruit, he saw his trees bare. “A thief must have climbed over my fence,” Masoy thought, so he raised the bamboo fence"

But the-fruit continued to be stolen and he grew impa- tient. He went to the wild wood and gathered plenty of pitch from the for est trees. He shaped the sticky pitch in the form of a man, stood it ina comer of his or chard, and put a straw hat on its head. “The thief will see the pitch- man and think it is I,” thought Masoy, walking home. By and by a monkey came along. It was this monkey who had been stealing Masoy’s bananas and or anges. When he saw the pitch-man, he said to himself, “This is Masoy. I shall mock him, for anyway I can easily run away from him.” Then he walked to the pitch-man and said, “Good morning, Masoy.” Of course the pitch-man did not answer. “Won't you even return a polite greeting?” said the monkey. “Good morning, Masoy.” 88 But still the pitch-man did not speak. So the monkey came near and slapped its face. “Take that for not return- ing a polite greeting!” he said. His blow fell so hard that his hand sank into the pitch-man’s face. He tried to pull out his hand but it would not come off. “Won't you let go of my hand?” shouted the monkey and hit the pitch-man with his other hand. That hand stuck, too, and, “Let go of my hands!” yelled the monkey. - But the monkey’s hands would not come off, so he kicked the pitch-man, first with one foot and then with the other. This made him stick to the pitch-man completely. Then with all his might the monkey struggled to get off, but the more he tried, the more he tired himself. By and by Masoy entered the or chard and found the monkey trapped. “Ah,” said he, “so it is you who have been stealing the fruit in my or chard"

Now you shall pay for your thieving.” “So this man is not you, Masoy!” said the monkey in surprise. “Now I know why he was so rude. I said good morning to him and he did not answer.” Masoy laughed. “Maybe so,” he said. “But what will you say for yourself before I kill you?” “I do not deny that I have been eating some of the fruit of your trees,” replied the monkey. “But spare my life and I 89 will serve you well.” Masoy had a naturally kind heart, and he pulled the monkey out of the pitch. From that day on the monkey became Masoy’s servant. He did all the house work for Masoy and ran errands for him. One day on his way to the village the monkey found a piece of silver and a piece of gold lying ona river bank. He went to Masoy and asked, “Master, why don’t you get yourself a wife?” “Why should I get me a wife when I can hardly support myself?” said Masoy. “In that case, get a wife who can support you,” said the monkey. “Let me try to get you a wife.” So, early next morning the monkey went to the house of the village chief and said, “Honored chief, please lend me a rice measure.” “What will you do with a rice measure, my good friend?” asked the chief. “My master has some money he has no time to count,” replied the monkey. “He thinks he better measure it in- stead.” “Very well,” said the chief and loaned him a well- polished coconut shell used for measuring rice. The monkey told Masoy nothing about it, but next day, before returning the measure to the chief, he carefully stuck the silver piece to the bottom of the measure. He held the measure before the chief so that he would see the piece of silver. “There is a silver piece at the bottom of the measure,” said the chief"

But first I must see your master. Send him to me.” “I will do that,” said the monkey and left. As he crossed the river he saw a rich merchant bathing. He found the merchant’s clothes on the river bank, stole them, and ran home with them. “The merchant has many clothes and does not need them all,” thought the monkey. “He will not become poor by losing just these clothes, but my master may become rich by wearing them.” “Where did you get such splendid clothes?” Masoy asked when the monkey got home with them. “I am your servant and must serve you the best way I can,” replied the monkey. “Do not ask any questions, but do what I ask you to do. Change into these clothes and follow me.” So Masoy bathed, put on the merchant's clothes, and walked to the village with the monkey. They took a new 91 path so the merchant would not see them. The chief saw Masoy and he was well pleased with him and asked, “Have you a palace?” The monkey made a sign to Masoy, and Masoy replied, “Yes, your Honor.” “I should like to come and pay you a visit,” said the chief. “It would be a great honor to me, sir,” replied Masoy, still following the monkey’s signals. “Would it be all right if I came this afternoon?” “Yes, sir. You would be very welcome, sir,” said Ma- Soy. Then the monkey hurried out, leaving Masoy behind. He told the people whom he passed beside the road that if anyone should ask whose lands they tilled and whose cattle they used for work, they should say that everything be- longed to Masoy. “Otherwise, the chief will get angry, and an angry chief is a cruel man,” the monkey warned them. The people promised to do so, and the monkey hurried along until he came to a large palace hidden in the woods"

The monkey dug on with out a word. “Hey!” shouted the witch. “Tell me why you dig near my gate. Speak or you will be sorry!” Then the monkey looked up and said, “The great chief is coming this way with his whole army. So I must dig me a hole to hide in. Be off with you now, for I have work to do ina hurry.” Then he resumed his digging. The witch became alarmed and said, “My friend, be good and let me share the pit with you.” “I do not want anyone to share this pit with me,” the monkey replied. “Time is running short and I cannot dig a pit big enough for two. Dig yourself another pit.” “I will do nothing of the kind!” shouted the witch. “I will take this pit from you.” So saying, the witch jumped into the pit and pushed the monkey out. Then the monkey quickly pushed large rocks into the pit and the witch was killed. Meanwhile, the village chief was walking thither with Masoy.

He was delighted to find that his future son-in-law had so much wealth, for the monkey showed him all the gold hidden in a pit under the witch’s palace. So, to tell a long tale fast, Masoy married the chief’s daugh- ter. Ido not know whether the chief ever found out the trick the monkey played on him, but Iam pretty sure Masoy and his wife lived happily with their faithful servant the rest of their lives. 94"

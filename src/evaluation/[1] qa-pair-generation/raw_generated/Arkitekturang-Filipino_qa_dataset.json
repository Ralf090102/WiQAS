Perez, III The titleof thisbook—Arkitekturang Filipino—mayresurrectan old question: Is the resucha thingas Filipinoarchitecture? Can one speak of itas one speaks of Filipinomusic, Filipinodance, Filipinopainting, Filipinosculpture, Filipinoliterature, Filipinotheater, and Filipinocinema; thatisto say, as something recognizably Filipino, something thatreflectsthecultureand spiritofthe Filipinopeople? Itshouldn’tbe surprisingto hear vehement denialsof the existenceof Filipino architectureeven from academics and architects. The various. buildingsof the Spanish colonial, American colonial, and postcolonialperiodsaredismissedas mere imitationsof Western architecture. The in digenousdwellings, which developed from precolonialtraditions, arenot consideredarchitectureat allsincetheyare not monumental. Such judgments arisefrom plainignorance, a colonialmentality, and the nationalpropensityforself-bashing. Anyone who has diligentlyexamined the varioustypesofbuildings in thiscountryand has bothered to look in to their historywillrealizethatthereissuch a thingas Filipinoarchitecture. The author, Gerard Lico, has chosen a Filipinotitlefor abook thatisentirelyin English. Translatedinto English, the titlewould be either Filipino Architectureor Philippine Architecture.|sthereany difference? Inan articlepublishedin 1958, writer Danny Villanuevamade a distinction.“Philippinearchitecture”is“on lya genericterm we use to denote geography or the placewhere the buildingsare located.”Filipinoarchitecture, on the other hand, would be the term for that which istheappropnate responsetotheenvironmentand to the Filipino’sindividual and socialneeds. Itcouldbe understood asthereflectionand expressionofculture, which arisesfrom human beings’in teractionwith the irenvironment, with their history, and among the mselves. Inthebriefdescriptionof the book’scontent, the author usestheterm “Philippine architecture.”Being “geographical,”itiscomprehensive, and would the refore in cludeboth what istruly Filipinoarchitectureand what isnot. Historiesof Filipinoarchitecture—the term |prefer—which are contained in a number of books and essays, usuallyfocuson the evolutionofbuilding forms in the lightof political, economic, social, and culturaldevelopments, and on the synthesisofnative and for eignelements. Lico’shistoryisnot on lyan account of an evolution but also a critiqueof the succession of regimes. He shows how architecturehas been an in strumentofdomination and even in justice. The subject isnot only Artinallitssplendorbut also Power and itshidden ugliness: the power of colonialmasters, the power ofa dictator, and the power of global business. But, for tunately, power does notdestroythegeniusofthe Filipinoarchitect, whether unschooled or for mallytrained. To develop histhesis, Licohas assembled a vast amount of in for mation and commentary thatisboth enlighteningand in dicting. The saga beginswiththeearlypeoplesettlinginfound shelters—treesand caves. Nature herselfisthearchitectofthesedwellings. Indigenoushouses arerecognizedas architecture, although qualifiedby the term “vernacular.”Licoenablesthereaderto appreciatesuch buildingsnot on lyinthe Southeast Asian contextbut alsointhewider Austronesiancontext.

The chapter on the Spanish colonialperiod—entitled“Spectacleof Power”— recountsthetransformationof the countrythrough the establishmentoftowns in compliance with Philip II’s Ordenanzas for effectivecontrolof the natives. The colonizer’saccommodation to the environment and nativeculturegave birthto what was christenedarquitecturamestiza. Thisdevelopedintothebahay na bato. “Imperial Imaginings,”which coversthe American colonialperiod, focuseson Daniel Burnham’s plans for Manila and Baguio and the irimplementation by William Parsons. Baguio was to be developed for the comfort of the colonizers. Filipinoarchitectsof the period—Juan Arellano, Arcadio Arellano, Antonio Toledo, Tomas Mapua, Tomas Arguelles, Andres Luna de San Pedro, Juan Nakpil, Femando Ocampo, and Pablo Antonio—are highlightedinthischapter. The section on Art Deco shows how European stylewas “Filipinized.” The chapter “Postcolonial Modernity” in cludesthe period of reconstruction following World War Il, the planforthe Capital City, the architectureofgovernment buildings, low-costhousing, and the architecturalstylesand outstandingarchitects of the late 1940 sto the early 1970 s. “Vernacular Renaissance” begins with the buildingscommissioned during the Conjugal Dictatorship and, later, examines the various trends: Romantic Regionalism. Pragmatic Tropicalism, and Neovernacularism, represented respectivelyby Leandro Locsin, Felipe Mendoza, and Francisco Mafosa. Paradoxically, an eraof repressionspawned a Romantic movement. The lastchapter,“Architectureof Pluralism,”examines Postmodernism in the Philippines, the phenomenon of the malls, and the globalcitiesof Manila: Fort Bonifacio Global City, Rockwell Center, and Eastwood City Cyberpark. With globalization, more and more for eignarchitectshavebeen engaged to design major projectsinthe Philippinesincollaborationwith Filipinoarchitectswho are designated“architectsof record.”The reasonsforthisaremany and apparently convincing. One fears, however, thattheperiodof Postmodern architectureinthe Philippinesmight wellbecome the periodof Post-Filipinoarchitecture. But perhaps, one way or another, as in the past, the Filipinowillprevail. X ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO Preface Architecturepossessesthe capabilityto reflecttheessenceof a time and a place likeno other artifact. Itnot only embodies the collectiveculturalvaluesof the societythat made itpossible, but alsopalpablymanifeststhe society’screative responsesto environmentalimperatives, the ecologicalmilieu, power structures, and even materialdeprivation. The Philippineshas longbeena locusofexchange and a crucibleofculturalcross- breedingbecauseofits geographiclocationand archipelagicopenness, which has resultedina wealth of architecturalexpressions. Thisbook presentsa wide range of builtforms, from the crudestmodes of human habitation, such as primeval caves, to the most sophisticatedartificialenvironments, such as postmodern megastructures. Architectureinthe Philippinesisextremelymultifaceted, mirroring the richdiversityofcultural, historical, and geographicinfluencesthathave for ged the Filipinonationas a whole. As the title Arkitekturang Filipino: A Historyof Architectureand Urbanism in the Philippinessuggests, thisbook tellsthe storyof architecturethat isrooted in geography. At the same time, the book expressesa nation’saspirationto an entitlement. The term “Arkitekturang Filipino”isheavilychargedwiththequestfor nationalidentity. To averthomogenizing thisintoa singularconstruct, the geo- politicalsettingisestablishedinsubtitleto substantiatethevarietyofgeographic conditionsand the pluralityof Filipinoculturesthathave shaped the sebuiltforms. Filipinoarchitectureisthereforeoverwhelminglydiverse, generatedby a myriad of architecturalpractices, buildingprocesses, regionalexpressions, cultures, the divergentexperiencesofclass, gender, religion, ethnicity, and the idiosyncrasiesof the buildingauteur. What thishistorydoes isto explorethe pluralismthat has enrichedthecomplexityof Filipinoarchitecturalexpressions—the energy, vitality, and in tricaciesthispluralismhas in evitablybrought. Inthisvolume, |employed the term “architecture”to referto amore encompassing category: the “builtenvironment.”This implicatesan entireculturallandscape, in cluding the so-called designed landscapes, urban spaces, and human modificationsofnaturalspaces. Inso doing, the long-standingcanonicdichotomy between vernacularand monumental and the taxonomic distinctionbetween “low architecture”and “high architecture”are dismantled, as both the sepolar sets, although materiallydisparate, essentiallyshare common architectural strategieswhere the irrespectivebuildersand designersemploy the same tacticsto createhabitablespaces.

There are as much archetypalforms of vernaculararchitectureas there are ethnolinguisticgroups in the Philippines. Due to thisculturaldiversity, in teresting forms and or namentation have emerged. The mountain people have developed architecturalforms differentfrom those who livealong the coastlineor on flat lands. Although, there isa strong commonality in the dispositionof spaces, “communal memory,” socialorganization, lifestyle, beliefsystem, exposure to for eign culture, natural environment, building technology, and available constructionmaterialscreatethe variationsacrossthe differentethnocultural communities. Philippine Muslim architecturehas neverbeen givensingularfocusas a subjectof empiricalresearch until Lico did in thislandmark textbook. The wealth of in for mationthathe has amassed confirmsthe Muslims’nghtfulplacein Philippine architecture. As earlyasthethirteenthcentury, the in digenouspopulationinwestern Mindanao had alreadyembraced Islam. Muslims designspacesinthe lightof the Koran but retainthemultifunctionalmode of Filipinospaces. Our ancestorshad to grapplenotonlywiththeragingtyphoons, violentearthquakes, and searingsun, but alsowith for eignintruderswho triedto subjugatethem, the easiestway by to tallyerasingtheirculture. But our resilientancestorshave deluded those who wanted to subjugatethem by the irseeming meekness. The Filipino in dividualityismanifested by the architecturethatour ancestorshave created: overflowinginlightand air, generouslyembellished, and welcoming. Inthesixteenthcenturythe Spanish conquistadoresvanquished resistanceinthe archipelagothrough “the crossand the sword.” New forms of structureswere in troducedwhich were not essentialinthe early Filipinos’traditionalexistence. The new Roman Catholicbeliefsystembuiltsplendidchurches, conventos, and belltowers. Fortifications, codificationof town planning, civicstructures, lighthouses, bridges, and portoshoned ourancestors’constructionvocabularyto articulate Filipinoarchitecture. The lifestyleofthenew colonialmastersofworking and relaxingindoorswas so contraryto the Filipinos’preferredoutdoor existence. So even the new multiroomed bahay na bato, ceramic roof tiles,“stone and mortar” constructiontechniques, which createdwhat was calledarquitectura mestiza, emerged as Filipinoarchitecture. The naming of the colony as Filipinasafterthe King of Spain Felipe IIdealta strongerblow than the establishmentof the reduccion, the encomienda, and the cuadriculaplanning in alteringthe socioeconomic and culturalenvironment in the Philippinearchipelago. Three hundred yearsofcontinuous in teractionwith Spain and Mexico have leftan in delibleimprinton Filipinoarchitecture, and yet the Spanish colonialperiod churches are localarchitecturalimprovisations embellishedwith neoclassicor baroque Philippineflowers, fruits, and crocodiles. This book, a landmark achievement in the quest for Filipinoarchitecture, exhaustivelydetailstown planning milestones, achievements in domestic architecture, civicarchitecturetypologies, and Filipinointerpretationsofclassical European typologiesand architecturalstyles. The Filipinoinstitutions: the sabungan, san-sanstore, and turo-turoor carindena, arearchitecturallydissected as wellas commercial and recreationalstructuresthatsustainedthe livelihood XIV ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO and sociallifeofthatperiod. By then the populationwas a blend of Easternand Western cultures: Indio, mestizo Indio, Insulares, Peninsulares, Sangley, mestizo Sangley. Beforethedawn of the twentiethcentury, triggeredby landtenureproblems, the Filipinonationalistsfinallyclamored for reformsfrom the Spanish government. The martyrdom of patriot Dr. Jose Rizalprovokedtherevolutionagainst Spainand in 1898, the Philippinerevolutionaryforcesdeclaredindependenceofthecountry from Spain. By a “quirkof an in ternationalaccident,”the Spanish-American War was resolvedwiththepurchaseofthe Philippinesfrom Spain by the United States. Intheraceforsupremacy among the colonialpowers, the additionofthe Philippines to the colonialcoffersofthe United Stateswas an opportunitytoassertdominance in the region. Asocietaltransformationand architecturaluniformitywere about to happen with the United Statesimposing the American Neoclassicstyleand Daniel H. Burnham’s built-environmentprescription. Plansfornew citiesand architecturewere for mally crafted. The Filipinoi/ustrados, some of whom were sent to study abroad as pensionados, worked with American architects. There were tremendous opportunitiesto launch projectsineducation, resourcedevelopment, publicworks, sanitationand publichealth, communication, transportation, and conservation. The ilustradosand the hacenderos were able to consolidatetheirresourcesto continue the irinfluenceas wellas the irpoliticalpower. Eventually, the enlightened Filipinonationalists, realizingthedisparitycreatedby colonialism, clamored for balance in nationalinterests. The strongpetitionfor in dependence was addressed with the US Congress passage of the Philippine Independence Act of 1934"

Cave Dwellings as the Early Human Shelter Prehistoriccave shelterswere the earliestform of human habitation. The use of naturalcaves predated the emergence of Homo sapiens. Constructing cave dwellingsonly required minimal site-workand modification as the shelters conformed to the structuralpropertiesof rockor earthinsitu. The shelterswere made viaexcavationratherthan construction. Cave spaces were hollowed out eitherby extendingcavesor burrowing in to the recessesofthe cliffs, yieldingforits occupantsa livingspace protectedfrom heat, rain, and wind. In the Philippines, the earliestdwellersof caves were the Pleistocenepeople, of fspringsof the Ice Age. They had come on foot by way of land bridgesthat emerged when the seasubsidedbecause of the for mationofglaciersand the polar icecaps some two to halfa millionyearsago. The most antiquated, and perhaps the largest, cave periodicallydwelt in by prehistoricfamiliesforthirtythousand yearsisthe Tabon Cave complex, situated on Lipuun Point, southwestof Palawan. Itcovers 138 hectaresofrugged cliffsand deep slopes. Ahuman bone fossiltentativelydated from 22,000 to 24,000 years ago was discoveredin Tabon Cave in the 1960 s by a team of National Museum archeologistsheaded by the late Dr. Robert B. Fox. The cave’sportalisabout sixteenmetersinwidth and eightmetersinheightand extendsto an in teriordepth of forty-one meters. Verifiedthrough findingsfrom archeologicalexcavationsand carbon-14 datings, the cavewas found to have been suitableforhuman habitation. Infact, the cliffsand slopesaround the area are punctured with more than 200 caverns. Twenty-nineofthese caveswere fullyexploredand found to have been idealforhabitationor burialby ancient Filipinos. The cave was named “tabon” afterthelarge-footedbirdthatlayseggsinhuge holesitdigsintocavefloors, many of which have been found in the cave.

Nomadism and Ephemeral Portable Architecture Ephemeral architecturewas one of the firstartifactscreated by humans. The primitivelifestylewas essentiallynomadic, needing a form of temporary shelter thatutilizedreadilyavailablematerialswith limitedinvestmentintime and energy. As nomadism entailedconstant movement, materialsthat were portableand demountable were requisitesindesignand construction. BETWEEN THE EARTH AND Sky 9 Inthe Philippines, the fundamental actof buildingwas practicedby nomads in the form of the windbreak (lean-to), windscreen, or windshield. Itwas setup for shelterbeforecommencing a huntingor food-gatheringjourney. Early Filipinos constructeda wind-sun-and-rainscreenanchoredby a poleorstickatan angleon the ground. The lean-to isthe early dwelling of the Aeta. This transient architecture isan in alienableaspect of their nomadic lifestyle. Itisstillvery popular among Aeta groups, although the acculturated Aeta of Pampanga and Zambales, not as nomadic as the irancestors, have chosen to settlein more permanent abodes, like the irstilthouses—structures raised above the ground on wooden posts with thatched roofs and walls.

Arboreal Shelter: Dwelling High on Trees While the firstto be in habitedby people were the caves, the firstsheltersto be constructedwere made of in terlockingbranches. L’Abbe Laugier(1713-1769) providesan account of man’s searchforshelterinhis Essaisurl’Architectureof 1753: Some [branches] broken off in the for est are materials for his purposes. He chooses four of the strongest and raises them perpendicular to the ground, to form a square. On these four he supports four others laid across them. The illustration, which accompanied this account, showed that these latter branches laidacross the fork of trees were stillrooted to the ground. Inthe nineteenthcentury, arborealsheltersreinforcedthe racialstereotypesof post-Darwinianevolutionaryconceptsas“climbingdown from trees,”representing the transitionof man from ape to sentienthuman being. Frenchman Paul de la Gironiere, alsoin 1854, providestheearliestwrittendescriptionofthe treehouse in the Philippines. Investigatingthe houses and settlementconfigurationof the Tinguianof Palan, northwestof Abra, he observedthatthe Tinguianhad a separate daytime and nocturnalabode.

Inthe Philippines, the treehouse isan old in stitution, builtand used by the Gaddang and Kalingaof Luzon, the Manobo and Mandaya of Mindanao, and by the Maranao of Lake Lanao, accordingto Alfred Louis Kroeber (1928). Tree houses areusuallyfound in areaswhere violentintertribalconflictsand nocturnal raidsare frequent. These houses are perched on the for ked branchesoftrees, six, twelve, or even eighteen meters above the ground. Kroeber stressedthattreehouses arehighlyelevatedto protectfamilieslivingin isolatedcommunities from the at tackof animals and human enemies. The treehousesof the Manobo of Southern Mindanao aremade witha rectangular frame, hipped roof, and paneled walls. The floorsarebuiltwith strongjoiststo form a platform.

Although the historicalgenesisand age of the terracesare subjectto debate, modern datingtendsto support archeologist Henry O. Beyer’scontentionthatthe terraceshad existedat leastby 1000 BC. From 1964 to 1967, Robert Mahler, chairman of the Department of Anthropology, West Michigan University, collected charcoalspecimens of ricechafffrom a house terracein Banaue, which revealed the date 2950 BP or roughly 1000 BC.

The stone walls, canals, dams, and reservoirsof the Cordillera can also be considered as types of megalithic architecture, or, at least, of stone engineering. The amount of stones used by the Ifugao in the irhydraulic engineering works is estimated to farexceed in bulk those used in building the Pyramids or the Great Wall of China. Many of these walls and canals are thousands of years old and have with stood countless typhoons and the effectsof sun, wind, and time.

Majorityofvernacularbuiltforms aredwellings, whether permanent or makeshift, constructedby the irowners or by communities, which assemblethebuildingresources, or by localspecializedbuildersorcraftsmen. Granaries, for tifications, places of worship, ephemeral and demountable structures, and contemporary urban shantiesbelong to the vernacularlineage. The pervasivephrase “primitivearchitecture”in the 1980 s has unwittingly disseminateda pejorativeimplicationemphasizingthedualisticdistinctionbetween “primal”and “cultivated,”“barbarism”and “civilization,”and “nonwestern” and “western.”Similarly, the category“in digenousarchitecture,”used by otherwriters seemed to bracket off the nonformal architectureintroduced and builtby immigrant and colonialistpopulation in or derto privilegethose buildingforms constructedby the in digenes. The category“anonymous architecture”reflectsthe biastowards buildingsdesigned by named and canonic architects, while“folk architecture”istingedwith issuesofclass differentiation. The same privilegingis of feredby “ethnicarchitecture,”a term thatreflectsan exoticizationofthe residual ethnolinguistic Other by the dominant cosmopolitan culture.

Allforms of vernaculararchitectureare builtto meet specificneeds, primary of which isthe accommodation of values, economies, and ways of livingof the culturethat produced them. The construction of vernacular buildingsalso demonstrates the achievements and limitationsofearly technology. Relatedto the irenvironmentalcontext, the yarehandcraftedby the owner or by members of the community, requiringno assistancefrom designprofessionals, such asarchitects and engineers, utilizingtechnologieslearnedonlythrough tradition. Indubitably, thistradition, dictatingtheoverallform and tessellationofstructuralcomponents, has been perfectedthrough an evolutionaryprocessinvolvingtrialand error. Once the dwellingsare built, minor adjustments to compensate for the changing environmental conditionscan easilybe made. Modificationsto the irform or materialscan effectivelybe executedas long as the changing socialrequirements or seasonalclimaticvariationoftheir respectiveregionalsettingsarenot too great or sudden.

According to a writtenaccount, Jenny was so “impressedby the possibilitiesofframed constructionwhen he spent three months in Manila, in the Philippines, followinga voyage on one of his father’swhaling ships”(Condit 1964, 81). Snatching the structuralprinciplehe singledout from the vernacularsource, he then appropriatedand transcoded the tectonicprincipleinsteeland ironto replacetimberand bamboo.

Austronesian Building Heritage and the Aquatic Cultural Network of Asia-Pacific Notwithstandingregionalvariationsinform, style, and constructiontechnologies, a shared architecturaltheme and common designprinciplecan be discernedin vernaculararchitectureinthe Philippines. These correspondencescan be traced to the ancient Austronesianbuildingtradition, which can be found throughout most of the islandsin Southeast Asiaand the shorelinesof Asia Pacific. PHILIPPINE VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE 19 2.7 and 2.8 Variationsof a coastal Tausug house. Both featurea slightlysaddle-back roof outlineand a plaincross- gable finial. The archetypal Austronesianhouse consistsof pileconstructionon stilts, a raised livingfloor, and a pitchroof with extended ridges. Variantson these general architecturalthemes occur throughout the archipelago, at testingto the gradual diffusionofthis ancientarchitecturaltraditionfrom a common pointofcultural on gin. These common architecturalfeaturesevolved as a resultof the monsoonal and aquatic-based way of life sincesettlementpatternshave a directconnection to bodies of water. Communities were usuallysituatedalong shelteredbays, coastal areas, and mouths of rivers. Interiorsettlementswere establishedattheheadwaters and banks of riversand the irtributaries. Inthe Philippines, thistypeof settlement can be found in Cebu, Leyte, Bohol, Panay, Cagayan, Agusan, Lanao, Manila, and others. The bodies of water provided food, such as fish, shrimp, and shellfish, which were easilyharvested around the communities. Transportation on and along the riversand streams was alsopractical. Much more, riceculturesinthese placeswhere wetlands prevailedalsoconditioned the house typesto be raisedon stilts. The term Austronesianrefersto a familyoflanguages, believedto have or iginated in Taiwan some 6,000 yearsago, numbering some 1,000 to 1,200 languages spoken in the vast geographicalarea between Madagascar, Taiwan, Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand. Although many peoplesconstitutethiswidely scatteredlanguagegroup, the ircommon culturalbackground can stillbe perceived. Inadditionto linguisticaffiliation, distinctiveattributes, definedby a world-view linkedto an aquatic-basedviewoflife, and translatedintoarchitecturalterms, are found throughout the Austronesianregion.

This movement can be reconstructed chronologicallyfrom archaeological and linguisticsources. These sources suggest that Taiwan was settledaround 4000 BC. From Taiwan the Austronesians seem to have spread south into the Philippinesvia Batanes about 3000 BC and Borneo, Sulawesi, and eastern Indonesia a thousand years later. The colonization of Oceania to the east did not begin untilafter 2000 BC and the Malay Peninsula and Vietnam were colonized by the Austronesians sometime after 1000 BC. Madagascar was not reached untilabout 400 AD. At roughly the same time New Zealand was colonized by other Austronesian-speaking peoples travelingfrom Tahiti. The Austronesianexpansionrequireda sophisticatedsystemofopen seanavigation, which differedgreatlyfrom sailingalongthecoastlineor to visiblelandmarks.

The lexicallyreconstructedforms of these varioushouse terms are:(1) rumagq;(2)balay,(3)lepaw;(4) kamalir, and (5) banua. The term “rumaq” isthemost widelydistributedterm for“house,”which isincluded in the Iban, Gerai, and Minangkabau (rumah) and Rotinese(uma) vocabulary. The similarform isused to designatethe Badjao stilthouse (/uma) thatislocated in the waters of the sea near the shorelineand elevatedfrom the water by a number of major and minor posts, poles, and stilts. “Balay”takesa varietyof form in the Malayo-Polynesianand Oceanic languages. Inthe Philippines, reflexesofthisterm (Isneg, balay; Cebuano, balay)referto a “house,” while in Malay languages, the term balaisignifiesa “publicmeeting house.”Inthe Pacific, the reflexesofbalaydenote the same meaning astheydo in the Philippines(Fijian, vale; Samoan, fale; Hawaiian, hale). The thirdterm,“lepaw,”alsorefersto a house but assumesa varietyofmeanings: a “storehouseforgrain”(Ngaju,/epau); a “hut otherthan the longhouse” (Uma Juman, /épo); and a “back verandah or kitchenverandah of a Malay house, booth, or shop” (Malay, lepau). Inthe Philippines, the Badjao word /epadenotes a “long, slow-moving houseboat withno outrigger’; the structureofwhich isloose and detachable, with long polesattached in alldirectionsas a framework over which a nipa roof may be unrolled. The house term “kamalir”isadapted in the Philippinesas kamaligorkamarin that generallyrefersto a “granary, storehouse, or barn,”whereas in Oceanic language, itdenotes a special“men’s house.” Finally, the term “banua” occursinthe Malayo-Polynesianvocabularyinreference to the “house” (Toraja, banua; Banggai, bonua; Wolio, banua; Molima, vanua; Wosi-Mana, wanua). Farmore of ten, reflexesofbanua denote a terntorialdomain, such as “land, country, place, settlement, in habitedterritory, village.” PHILIPPINE VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE 23 Naga, an Austronesian Water Symbol The naga, Sanskrit for serpent, represents the cosmological model’s waveform as well as the universalityof water in the daily lifeof Southeast Asia. The said creature is aquatic in character, but also appears in hybrids. The Thai sang isa cross between a snake and a lion, and the Chinese and Japanese dragon isa flyingamphibian. However, the basic forms are primarilywave-likein nature, as seen in architecturalomamentation and building motifs where the naga is best exhibited in itswater element.

This phenomenon stimulated on the Asian waterfronts a host of in terpretationsin terms of urban planning and architectureand in almost every art form and ritual, both sacred and profane. The naga motif predominates artifactssuch as Islamiccarvings in boats, musical in struments, grave markers, protrudingbeam ends, and designpatternsfound in woven textilesand wallornaments produced by Maranao, Samal, Tausug, and other Philippine Islamicgroups.

As describedby the Englishtraveler William Dampier in 1687, the earlylvatanhouses were builtsmalland low, the irsidesmade of smallposts not more than 1.4 meters high. These houses had ridgepoles, which were about 2.1 or 2.4 meterslong. A fireplacewas builtatone end of the house. The occupants had simplewooden boards placedon the ground to lieon. The houses were builtclosetogetherin smallvillageslocatedon the slopesor peaks of hills. They appeared to be stacked one on top of the other sincethey occupied varyinglevelsofsteeprockfaces.

The hutswere low, partlybecause highstructureswould have been easilytoppled by verystrongwinds with ninemonths of rain and a constantonslaughtofcyclones and partlybecause Batanes did not possess enough timber resources nor appropriatetoolsforlargerconstruction. Cogon grass(Imperatacylindrica)was the main roofingmaterial. To closethe sidesof the hut, cogon and stickswere used. Occasionally, the wallswere made of stones heldtogetherby fango, a kind of mortar for med by mixingmud with bitsand piecesofcogon. The more familiarlvatantraditionalhouse of stone and mortar (known as caly canto)made the irfirstappearance in the lateeighteenthorearlynineteenthcentury when the Spanish government and the missions were founded, and public architecturelikechurchesand tribunales(town halls), for tifications, and bridges necessitateda much sturdiermaterial.

Inthe succeeding decades, steelreinforcementswere used. However, sincethese new materials, usuallyshipped from the neighboringislandof Luzon, were costlyand scarce, the productionofnative limeinkilnscontinued, and the Ivatanchose cogon overthe rust-pronegalvanizedironsheets. The use of cogon minimized the useofnails in the woodwork because the latterproved to be lessdurable because of eventual corrosion. Cordillera Houses William Henry Scott (1966) classifiedhouses in the mountain ranges of the Cordillerasin Luzon in to the northernstrainand the southern strain. According to Scott, the northern strainconsistsofhouses made by the Isnegand Kalinga. The southern strain, on the other hand, arethose constructed by the Ifugao, Bontoc, Ibaloi, and Kankanay. The northernstrainischaracterizedby houseswitha rectangularplancoveredby a highgableroof.

The house isa box supported by posts, reachingno higherthan the floorjoists. An example isthe windowless Ifugaohouse, with itslow wallsand roofs, which keep the in habitantswarm. The floorsare, however, raised 0.9 m above the ground. Although houses in the Cordillerasvaryinsizeand shape, the yallhave common functions. Primaryistheprovisionofshelterfrom the cold. Houses alsogiveenough protectionfrom dampness and humidity, which may destroythe grainsstored in sidethehouse or alang(granary). The structuresmust alsoofferdefenseagainst hostiletribesmen, wild animals, and vermin. To avoid landslides, the sehomes must be designed in relationto the terrainof the mountains.

The Isnegone-room abode, the binuron, with itslargeconcave- shaped roofresemblesan in vertedtraditional Isnegboat. The adoption of boat architectureto the designof the house may be at tributedto the factthat Apayao istheonlyregioninthe Cordillerawitha navigableriver, and among the mountain people of the north, on lythe Isnegspossessa boat-buildingtradition. The boat, known as barana’yor bank’l, ismade up of three planks: a bottom plank, which getsthinneratboth ends, and two plankson both sides, carvedand shaped to fit alongsidethe bottom plank.

Kalinga The Kalingasettlementsare situatedalong the Chico riverinthe north central regionof northern Luzon. These communities arestrategicallylocatedon steep mountain slopeswhere villagerscan easilybe alertedagainstinterlopers.

Despitethefactthatpresent-dayhouses have been in fluencedby nearbylowland communities—that is, the house being made of concrete, galvanizediron, and lumber—two typesoftraditional Kalingahouses remain extant: one isthefamed octagonalhouse (binayonor finaryon), which assumesa curvilinearform rather than polygonalatfirstglance; the otheristhesquare-shaped Kalingahouse known as for uyin Bangad, buloyin Mabaca, fuloyin Bugnay, phoyoyin Balbalasang, or biloyin Lubuagan. Wealthy familiesinthe pastlivedinoctagonallyshaped houses. At the coreof the eight-sidedhouse, a four-post-, two-girder-and three-floor-joistsystemforms the foundationof the house supportingthe 1.2 meter-highcentralfloor, which in turn PHILIPPINE VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE 37 isflankedby raisedfloorson eitherside. This ismade possibleby two beams restingon the end of the floorjoist. The sidefloorsreachto the outerwalls, which have eightsides. William Henry Scott(1966) providesa lengthydescriptionof the octagonalhouse of the Kalingain Bongod: the threefloorjoists, two girders, and four posts, which form the foundation of the house are called fat-ang, oling, and tuod, respectively, and ridingon to pof the joists aretwo beams or stringers that run from frontto back calledanisilor fuchis.

Bamboo Bamboo is found in large quantitiesnearly everywherein the archipelago. There are around thirty-twospeciesof bamboo in the Philippines. The commerciallyimportant bamboo speciesin the country are kauayan tinikor spiny bamboo (Bambusa lumeana); kauayan kiling(Bambusa vulgaris); Bayog (Dendrocalamus merrillianus); (Schizostachyum Iumampao). Among the five the preferred species for building, furniture making, and making boat outriggers. Bayog is used for tyingand making ropes. Bamboos are tall, tree-likegrasses. Mature bamboos are cut during dry season, or when the sap flow issluggishand sugar content islow—a condition where powder-post beetles,(Lyctus brunneus), locallycalledbukbok, are no longer drawn to itscane. To eliminate all in sects, bamboo canes are soaked in riveror lakewater or buried in the sand for some sixmonths priorto application. Bamboos can be used as fullcanes or splitlongitudinallyintohalvedor quarteredstrips or segments. The bamboo issplicedin thisway to maintain itsstructuralproperties. In the constructionof the bahay kubo, the bamboo performs as a structuralelement in the form of canes (for post, beams, and rails)or stiffeningframes (lattice), and as cladding material(for floors, walls, and fences)in the form of planks and latticepanels. The components can be easilyprefabricated, assembled, and replaced. Depending on the age and species, the bamboo can have variablediameters. Bamboos having diametersof fiveto twelvecentimetersare commonly utilizedfor building. Aside from being cheap, readilyavailable, and easilymanipulated with basictools, a variable cross-sectionaldiameter and an abilityto grow fastmake bamboo a popular building material. Cogon (Imperata cylindrica) Cogon isa perennialthatgrows in dense clusters to a heightof 1.8-2 meterswith narrow, rigidleaf- blades. Although in fenorto nipa, it Isefficientfor thatching and iswidely used wherever nipa is unavailable. Notwithstanding itsarchitectural application, cogon isused for soilerosioncontrol, mulch in coffeeplantations, fodder, papermaking, packaging, fuel, and or namental purposes. The rhizomes and root extractsare used medicinally. To make a thatched roof, the cogon Isfirstmade to dry. Bundling the dried grass follows aftera few days.

A pairof smoke vents can be placed in the roof fiftycentimetersbelow the ridge. Smoke coming from the firewood stove in the kitchenadds to the durabilityof cogon thatch as the smoke makes itsway through the beams and goes outsidethrough a hole on top of the roof.

From the nipa’sstalk, sap isextractedand made into alcohol, vinegar, wine, and sugar. Kernels of young nuts of nipa are made into sweets and preserves. The nipa palm isbelievedto be one of the oldestand most extensivepalms of the world, Found in India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and in some other Pacific islands, nipa isadapted to muddy soilsalong rivers and estuaries. In the Philippines, nipa isplanted in the months of May and August, at the heightof the rainyseason, when the soilissaturatedwith moisture. When mature, thisplant grows to about 3-3.5 meters in heightand itslong pinnate leavesacquire a richgreen color. Nipa as thatching materialisgenerallyregarded as superiorto coconut or cogon thatch because itperforms betterin repellingrainwater and of fershigherresistanceto rotting. Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera) The coconut palm may have or iginated in South America or Oceania, but itiswidespread throughout the Philippines, Malaysia, and India.

Rattan (Calamus) The rattan is a climbing palm that provides raw matenal for vernacularbuildingsand the cane-furnitureindustry. Itisthe most important for estproduct in the country aftertimber. In the Philippines, rattanisrepresentedby sixty-twospecies, of which twelveare of commercial value. Rattan has long and very flexible stems that need support. It is harvested every fifteen years when the stems have grown to an average length of twenty-five meters and a diameter of 1.5-3.5 centimeters. Afterwards, selective cutting of mature canes is done at a three- to four-year-gap. Rattan gatherersneed to pullthe canes down from the for estcanopy and remove the spinysheaths, leaves, and whips, leavinga bare cane. Rattan harvestingis, thus, a ratherdangerous undertaking—dead branches can be dislodgedas the rattanispulledand ants and wasps can of tenbe disturbedinthe process. The bare canes are carried out of the for est and partially processed; small-diametercanes are dried in the sun and of ten smoked, while largecanes are boiledin oil (of ten a mixture of dieseland palm oil)to remove excess moisture and natural gums and to prevent at tackby wood-boring beetles. Rattan isthe widely used materialfor lashing, binding, and knotting where structural materials, such as bamboo are to be joined. Slender, peeled rattan may be dried of the irresidualsap and then coiled, ready for use as a binding material, while thickerrattan, whose stems are solid, are used to make household items and furniture.

Postwar slummification is best captured in Lamberto Avellana’s classic Anak Dalita (1956). The story revolves around a Korean war veteran and a prostitute trying to survive poverty in the war-ravaged slum of Manila. Using a style derived from Italian neorealism, Avellana’s film takes us to the world of the walled slum of Intramuros, in the bombed-out shell of the church where each shanty at taches itselfto the brick wall of the church ruins for structural support. Malvarosa (1958), directedby Gregorio Fernandez, underscores a visualmotif of the railroadtracksthat run, not justthrough the community, but alsothrough the livesof itscharacters.

When Muslim tradersand missionariescame via the nearest Southeast Asian outpost, they eventuallysettledand systematically in troduceda new cultureto ourancestors in the Southern Philippines. The earliest evidenceof Muslim presencein Sulu, and possiblyof a Muslim settlementthat can be found isthe tomb of Tahun Maqbalu (Muqbalu) who died in 710 AD or 1310. Spain, beingunder verystrong Arabic in fluencefrom 732 to 1492 AD, the Spanish colonization of the Philippinesadded another dimension to the propagation of Muslim in fluencein Philippineculture, allowingaspectsof Ibero- Islamiccultureto graftitselftothe Christianizedcolonialculture. The Islamizationof Southeast Asia commenced between the eighthand nineth century, a period when Arabs were extensivelytradingwith the Chinese. These tradersestablishedtradingcentersin Southeast Asiaas the irregularcommercial stopoverson the irway to China. But with the politicalupheaval in South China during the laterperiod of the T’ang dynasty, for eignmerchants, in cludingthe Arabs, were expelledfrom China. They sought asylum in variousareasof Southeast Asia, principallyin Malaysia, awaitingthe restorationoforder in China and the resumption of normal commercial tieswith the Chinese. In the in terim, these tradersestablishednew economic routesin the adjacent islandsof Insular Southeast Asia. As tradebecame firmlyentrenched, the stations of commerce developedintoportsand businesshubs. Soon after, the Arab traders for gedeconomic relationsamong the wealthy nativepopulation. Marriage with the richnativesand localheadmen guaranteed the permanent consolidationof the irbusinesspartnership, of tentakingthedaughterofthe localchiefwho himself convertedto Islam. In these trade centers, the need for Muslim education was soon felt. Muslim teachers and missionaries were also among the firsttransmitters of Islamic religion. They came from the Arab region, such as Baghdad. Duringthelastquarterofthe thirteenthcentury, ifnot earlier, a Muslim community in Sulu alreadyexisted. Historically, the in troductionand diffusionof Islam in the Philippinesisattributedto Tuan Masha’ika and laterto Karim ul-Mahkdum, the leadingfiguresinthe Islamizationof Sulu, who came to ment or the childrenofthe richmerchants of Suluand assimilateallthe people in the areato the message of Allah. Infact, the firstto convertto Islamwere the tradingpartnersof the Muslim merchants. With the arrivalofmore Islamicteachers, the faithspread rapidlyand reached as faras Luzon. There isno historicalevidencethat the nativepeople resistedthecoming ofa new religion. Through the supportof the affluentand newly convertedbusinesspartners, the spreadofthe new religiongainedan unprecedentedmileagethroughoutthearea. One explanationforthe rapid Islamicexpansion in the Philippinesmay be the conversionofcommunity leaders. Thiswas crucialinthespreadofthe religionas the localleadershipcompelled the populationto embrace Muslim beliefs. Some scholarsargued, however, thattheindigenouspopulationthemselveswere simply and spontaneously at tractedto Islam because of the beautifulrituals, stories, and art.

The Sultanate of Sulu was the firstto be for mally established in 1450, with Abu Bakr as its first sultan. The second consolidation occured within Maguindanao; and the third was within Lanao. Communities which responded favorably to the ways of Islam were gathered to getherunder the mosque, the locus of communal spirituality. Islamacculturated the people to a novelway of life. With itcame the allianceofeconomic and social in fluencesinto politicalpower and authority. In Sulu, the oldest mosque isin Tubig; Indangan, Simunul islands.

Philippine Muslim Concept of Space As one religio-culturalgroup bound to getherby Islam and common historical experience, the Philippine Muslims belongto a larger Islamicand Southeast Asian grouping.

The choiceof Koranicversesmay be dictatedby a building’sfunction. Forinstance, the followingverseismost commonly in scribedon mosque doorways: “The mosques of Allah shallbe visitedand maintained by such as those who believe in Allahand the Last Day, establishregular prayers, and practiceregularcharity, and fearnone (at all)except Allah.

Forone, the sahn or wide enclosedcourtyardfurnished with an ablutionfountainisgenerallyabsent; in stead, a seatingareawith benches isprovidedoutsidethemosque where worshippersmay sitand talkwhilewaiting for the nextprayer. Similarly, the mimbar (elevatedpulpit)isnot highunlikethose of Africaand Western Asia. An elevatedplatform, a chairor any similarfurniture can replaceand function as a mimbar in some mosques. Here, the preacher deliversa sermon during Fridaycongregationalprayers. Furthermore, the callto prayerisusuallydone not on tallminarets, but in sidethe mosques. Hanging drums, variouslycalledtabo, jabu-jabu, or dabu-dabu, are beaten to summon the worshipper from afarto the mosque. Among the Yakan, abamboo drum is used for callingpeople to worship. But thispracticeisdiscouragedby the Ulama, a body of religiousscholarsand leaderswho havejurisdictionoverlegaland social mattersforthe people of Islam, becauseof its Jewishorigin. While minarets may be present in most Philippine mosques, they are not functional unlike those in the Middle East and India. With the advent of electronic sound amplifiers, minarets are in stead reduced to mere decorative vertical appendages, but they remain an essential iconic element of the mosque.

This representedan at tempt of the Spanish Crown to establisha uniform and extensiveurban plan of the colonies. King Philip’s compilationreinforcedtheunilateralobjectivesofconquest, emphasized the urban character of Spanish colonization, and clearlyspecifiedthe physical and or ganizationalarrangements thatwere to be developed in the new citiesof the Spanish empire. The Royal Ordinance encapsulated, in additionto the actualplanningexperience encountered in the Americas, the classicisttheoriesofurban designproposed by the Roman architect Vitruviusand the Italian Renaissancearchitect Leon Battista Alberti. The urban prescription, likethatof Vitruvius, exhibited“a keen awareness of the functionofopen squares as essentialarenas of economic and sociallife, as wellas placesforthe exposure of monumental edifices”(Reed 1978, 41). The lengthyurban statutesprovided overseascolonialadministratorsusefulmodels for the design of town and urban sitesforboth in landand coastalgeography. Colonialcitiesinthe Philippineswere, hence, builtaccordingto rulescodifiedin the Laws of the Indiesof 1573, specifyingan elevatedlocation, an or derlygridof streetswith a centralplaza, a defensivewall, and zones for churches, shops, government buildings, hospitals, and slaughterhouses. The “plaza complex” evolved, which consistedof a grid patternwith the main plaza at the center surrounded by the church-convent, the tribunal, and otherimportantgovernment buildings, and the marketplace. Houses of varioussocialclassesare usually hierarchicallydistributedaround thiscomplex. As the settlementsexpanded, secondaryplazaswere establishedindifferentareas. The main plazawas or dained to liecloseto the waterfront, the secondary plazaswere found in land, where growth naturallygravitated.

Spain’simmediate objectives in the Philippineswere to use the islandsas a base for furtherexpansion, to establishthe colony as a centerforthe production and exportoftropical spices, and to convertthe nativesto Christianity. Geographer Robert Reed (1978, 16) reports: The Adelantado (Miguel Lopez de Legaspi)was to ldto considera number of potentialsitesbeforemaking a choicebecause strategies of efficientexploration, balancedterritorialexpansion, and profitable trade ultimatelyhinged on the selectionof a strategicallylocated headquarters. In addition, Spanish authoritiesoffered advice concerningthe proper layoutof the proposed colonialcapital. They envisaged a substantialfortressas the nucleus of the imperial outpost. Hence, the foundationofa well-garrisonedpoliticalcenter, an adjoiningspace of residencefor Spaniards and Christianized Filipinos, and the constructionof a church designedtofunctionasthefulcrumofthe socio-religioustransformation of the emergent colonialcommunity were in the making.

In 1570, Legaspisent his lieutenant, Martin de Goiti, on a mission to Manila who returneda year later. Soon afterbeingelevatedtothe rank of Governor-Generalby King Philip Il, Legaspi was or deredto immediatelybegintheprocessofsystematicterritorialcolonization and sailedwithout delay to Manila to setup the administrativecenterof the colonialgovernment. Legaspilanded on the northshore, razedthedefensesofthe settlement, and eventuallyconquered Manila. Manila was captured with out a fightbecauseitshead, Rajah Sulayman, had evacuatedhisfortaftertheinhabitants setfireupon the irown settlement. On May 19, 1571, Legaspilaidthefoundation of Manila from the charred remains of Sulayman’s palisadedkingdom. By June 24, 1571, Legaspi of ficiallyinaugurated a municipal counciland proclaimed Manila as the capitalof the new territoriesunder the Spanish Crown. The newlyconquered settlementwas describedby Legaspiina letterto the Kingof Spain dated April 20, 1572: The villageof Maynilad issituatedon the to ngue of land extending from eastto west between the riverand the sea, and a for thad been builtat the extreme western end of the peninsulaat the entrance of the fort. The sea makes a verylargeharbor about thirtyleagues in circumference. Around the fort, a hundred and fiftyhuts for the Spanish of ficerswere builtby nativelabor, and the land around the citywas apportioned to men of the colonizingparty (Filipiniana Book Guild 1965, 195). Despitetheimpermanent and flimsyphysicalappearanceofthe earlycolonialcity of Manila, new activitieswere in troducedwhich necessitatedthecreationof novel in stitutionscharacterizingurban life. Slowlya citywas createdinaccordance with Hispaniclaw and urban heritage. The cityof Manila was a modest one: barracks for soldiers, residencesforofficers, and a chapel, allofwhich were made of light materials—bamboo, wood, and nipa thatch. Covering lessthan a mile in area, spreadingout from the pointofa triangleformed by the riverand the bay at Fort Santiago, Manila was envisionedas the Spanish almacen de lafe(displaywindow of the Faith), and bestowed the title“E/Insigney Siempre Leal Ciudad” on June 24, 1574 by a decreeby Philip II. As the ytook fullpossessionand administrationofthe city, the Spaniardsventured in land, spreadingthecrossand the reignof the Spanish Crown to the surrounding countryside. Capitalizingon the geographical endowment of Manila, they systematicallyextended the authorityof the Spanish colonialofficialdominthe archipelagoby means of militaryforce, the encomienda, and religiousconversion. While the in tramuralcitywas being builtand rebuilt, the friarstook itupon the mselvesto evangelizethe nativesand to implement the reduccion policies throughout the archipelagiccolony.

The Great Urban and Architectural Transformation A decade afterthefounding of the city, Manila could layclaimto the possession of urban elementscommon with most established Hispaniccities. The cityquarter was surrounded bya spikedlogpalisade. There was a centralplaza, a cabildo(a municipal building), and a generalmarket. As a portcity, Manila had a wooden portand a garrisonofsoldiers. The residencesof the Governor-Generaland of the Bishop were alsolocatedin it. The cathedralwas under constructionand was made of wood boards. The houses of the to wnsfolkoccupied the restof the area followingthegridstreetsystem. Manila was not spared itsshareofdisastersand tribulations. Forone, the citywas persistentlypreyed upon by piratesfrom the sea, such as thatwhich Limahong launched in 1574. Itsinternalpeace was threatenedby a sequence of Chinese in surrections, which began in the Parianquarter. Earthquakesand conflagrations took a heavytollon lifeand property. Fortheearlyarchitectureof both privateand publicedifices, the colonialauthorityused readilyavailableorganicmaterialsand traditionalmethods of construction.

However, a devastatingearthquake in 1645 shattered the ambitious plansof the Spaniards. Arquitectura Mestiza To avoid the consequences of both fireand earthquake, a new hybrid-typeof constructionwas in vented—the arquitecturamestiza—a term coinedby Jesuit Francisco Ignacio Alcinain 1668 to refertothestructuresbuiltpartlyofwood and partlyof stone (Merino 1987). This half-breedarchitectureused wood in the upper floorand stoneinitsground floorto make itresistantto earthquakes. Thus, alledifices, except the cathedrals, rarelyexceeded two floorsand had wallsof about threemetersthicksupported by but tresses. Asidefrom this, the in digenous framework, which reliedon in terlockingbeams and house posts, was in tegrated to support the house effectively. Inthistype of construction, the house postsor haliguessupported the second floor, whilethe stone wallsat the ground floor merelyacted as acompact curtainforthewooden framework of the house. Although the characterof the arquitecturamestizawas furtherinfluencedby amateur artisansand builders, the actualbusinessofbuildingwas executedby the maestros de obrasor master builders.

These areasremained astheywere, even by name, and grew with Manila in itsfirst century. But duringthisperiod, the Spaniardsbegan to buildtheirresidencesinthe suburbs or arrabales, and the Church authoritiesbegan to expand itsmissions into Binondo, Quiapo, Ermita, and Malate. While the districtsof Japanese Dilao and Chinese Parianwere conceivedand developedassegregatedquartersdesigned to controlthe potentiallymutinous aliens, the other arrabalesproximate to Intramuros emerged unstructured, receivingno of ficialdirectivesfrom the Spaniards. Malate became the home of ambitious maharlika (noblemen), tradesmen who amassed the irwealth from the new imperialorder, while the arrabalof Tondo was identifiedwithunderpnvilegednativeswho regularlyprovided freshfoodstuffsforthe markets of Manila and could be readilymarshaled for major publicworks or privateconstructions(Reed 1978, 63). Mechanical tradesand serviceswere zoned outsidethe walls. The trade names were reflectedinthe streettoponym in the areasof San Nicolas, Binondo, Santa Cruz, and Quiapo.

Virtuallyallweapons were obsolete and were either destroyedby the Americans or turned in to decorativepieces.

Charged with the missionto evangelizethe islands, the religiousordersfilledthe archipelagowith ecclesiasticaledifices— churches, monasteries, and convents—in newlyfounded parishes. The architecture thatresultedwas an artifactofculturalencounter, allowingunique architectural stylesto flourish, nativelaborgivinginterpretationand tangibilityto the friar’s blurredmemory of European baroque churches.

Friarsinthe sixteenthcenturybuiltplainchapelsof bamboo, thatch, and other lightindigenousmaterials. These worship structureswere no differentfrom the nativehouses—simple in plan and structure, with a rectangularnave and high pitchedroof. The floormay have been raisedabove ground, or may have been on ground levelorthebareearthitself. Friarchroniclesdescribedtheseearlychurches as de cana ynipa (of bamboo and nipa). Because of the material, the sestructures were easilydevoured by flames. Later, the sechurches evolvedintomonumental stonesanctuariesfusing European styleswith in digenousinfluencesbut retaining the simple rectangularplan. Thus, the single-navecolonialchurch owed the provenance of its form not from a European archetypebut from an in digenous precedent. Intraditional Western architecture, rectangularorlongitudinalchurches, as a rule, abide by the basilicanplan, which featureda centralnave with an aisle on each sideformed by two rows of columns and, typically, a terminalsemicircular apse.

Instudyingthegrammar of colonial governance, one willneed to readthrough the idiom of empire buildingthat can be gleaned in architecturalreferences. King Philip II, writinginthe 1573 “Prescriptionsforthe Foundationof Hispanic Colonial Towns,” makes itperfectlyclearthat the edificeof the church must demand at tention, ifnot enthrallingastonishment: In in land to wns, the church isto be on the plaza but at a distance from it, in a situation where itcan stand by itself, separate from other buildings, so that itcan be seen from allsides. Itcan thus be made more beautiful and itwillinspiremore respect. Itwould be builton high ground so that, in or der to reach itsentrance, people willhave to ascend a flightof steps (Reed 1976, 72).

In Palazon’saccount, colonial subjectsdepictedarefarfrom the image of anunquestioningbelieverwho gained spiritualsatisfactionfrom the buildingof a holystructure. Ultimately, the historian uncovers how colonialsubjectsingeniouslyattempted to avoid the task of constructingthe“house of God.” Palazon(1964, 16) thusdescribedthe in dio’s cunning strategyto evade labor: One of the most common practicesresortedto by the to wnspeople was to disappear from the to wns in or der to avoid carryingout those obligationsthatthey consideredtoo heavy for them to bear. We note from a decree issuedin 1621 by the Audiencia that the to wnspeople of Majayjaywere continuallyrefusingto be counted as citizensofthetown.

This practicebecame so widespread thatthe Audiencia was compelled to or der the provincialgovernor to tear down the houses erectedby the nativesintheirfieldsso as to compel them to liveinthe town. Architecture for Colonial Administration Monumental civicarchitecture, such asthe Palaciode Gobierno, the Ayuntamiento, and the Aduana, epitomizedthecolonialinstitutionsunderthe Spanishgovernance. Borderingthe Plaza Mayor of Manila were two of the most importantadministrative structuresin the archipelago. The firstwas known by various names: casa del ayuntamiento, casadelcabildo, casaconsistonal, casareal. Thisbuildingoccupied an entireblock on one of the sidesof the plaza mayor. As a seat of colonial governance, it housed several administrative of fices and archives. The Ayuntamiento isbestremembered for itselegantescaleraand portaland itslarge hallwhere state banquets and dances were celebrated. Itunderwent several modificationsand reconstructionworks. In 1845, the main facadewas refashioned ina styleinspiredfrom the Renaissance. Across the Ayuntamiento was the residenceofthe highestofficialofthe land: the Palaciodel Gobernador General or Palacio Real. The Real Audienciaor Tnibunal (trialcourt)was housed in anotherareauntilitsabolitionintheeighteenthcentury. Both the Ayuntamiento and Palaciowere European-in spired, two-storeystone structureswithspaciousinnercourts. They sharplydeviatedfrom the architectural genre of the bahay na bato. Unfortunately, these important examples of civil architecturewith distinctarchitecturalfeaturesdid not lastlong enough. The Palaciowas to ppled down in the earthquake of 1863, prompting the transferof the governor-generalroyalresidenceto Malacafiang Palace, for merlya vacation house of the governoralongthe Pasig River. The Ayuntamiento, afterstandingfor eightdecades, was alsoreduced to rubblein World War II. Other importantcivicstructures, were the Aduana (Customs House) and Hacienda Publica (Treasury), which furtherlavishedthe magisterialatmosphere of Intramuroswith classicistarchitecture.

In 1705, the Corps of Engineerswas establishedin Manila to takechargeofall constructions, in cludingthe erectionofchurches, government buildings, and otherstructures.

He alsodrew up the engineeringplan for the remodeling of Fort Santiago in 1714 to make it worthy of being a defensestructure. The earlychurches were builtunder the directionof architectsor maestros de obras (masterbuilders), many of whom were priests. These friararchitectswishing to buildor repairachurch were requiredto presentto the bishop a presupuesto, a proposal detailingthe drawings, plan, and cost estimates.

The actualconstructionor repairofbuildingswas sometimes contractedto builders, many of whom were Chinese. Thiscontractualsystemwas calledpaquio (pakyaw in Filipino)and managed to persistto thisday.

As the colonialsociety’sneeds expanded and socioeconomic progresswas at tainedthrough the galleontrade and cash-cropagriculture, the simplehouse of nipa y cafiacould no longersatisfy the demands of the new urban elitesand the provincialaristocracy. The urgent need was to acquirea new domestic prototypeexpressiveof the owner'scultural at tainmentand affectations. Despiteregionalvariationand centuriesoftransformation, the bahay na bato has retaineditsessentialfeatures. Generally, ithas two storeys, at times, three.

Houses builtof stone were fire-resistantbut caused more damage duringearthquakes, astheaccountsof the 1645 and 1658 tremorsclaim. Sinceit was observed that structureswith wooden frameworks proved resilientto any movement of the earth, the logicalsolutionwas an architecturalcompromise which combined stone with wood, a hybridearlierreferredto as arquitectura mestiza. Again, the designprinciplesof the bahay kubo became the in spirationindeveloping a similarhouse havingthe same featuresbut on a grander scale. Retainingthe bahay kubo’sbasiccharacteristics, such asthesteephiproof, elevatedquarters, post-and-lintelconstruction, and maximized ventilation, the new domestic form was similarlyframed in wood with an elevatedlivingspace of hardwood. The entirehouse was supportedby haligi(wooden pillars)in keepingwiththeendemic buildingtradition.

With the wide doors leadingto the rooms open on most occasions, the house virtuallyhad the essence of beingone bigspace. Accordingto architecturalhistorian Fernando Zialcita, the bahay na bato may be stylisticallycategorizedintotwo: the geometricstyleand the floralstyle. Between 1780 and 1880, the geometricstylewas widespread. Inthisstyle, the flyingwooden gallery, now calledeitherthegaleriavoladaorthecorredor, extended along the exteriorwalls, accentuatingthe horizontalityof the buildings.

Surfacedecorationswere keptto a minimum: translucentcapizshellsinsquares, diamonds on the window panels, and friezeswith simple, neoclassicalmotifs. During the nineteenthcentury, the use of enormous pillarswas minimized; false ceilingsand wooden wallswithgeometricfretworkon the irupper partdefinedthe livingquarters. The floralstylegained popularityduringthe lastthirdof the nineteenthcentury when the volada turned into an open gallerydecorated with vegetalmotifs.

Where brickwas not readily available, the house postsstood alongsidethewallsso as not to fracturethem. Another decree prohibitedthe use of curved tilesand, in steadrecommended eitherflattilesor imported galvanizedironorzincsheets. Because itwas cheaper and easierto in stall, the metal roof became more popular than flattiles. Unfortunately, the absence of ventilatorscaused the metal rooftoheat up easily, thus in creasingthe heat in sidethe house. But sincemetal roofswere light, they could projectbeyond the wallsto createwide eaves, which had soffitventsto provideoutletsforwarm airaccumulating under the roof. Windows were further screened by tapancos or media agues (metal awnings) made of sheet metal cutouts. With the seinnovations, which protectedthe house wallsfrom rainand sun, the volada was abandoned, making the in teriorof the house more spacious. Moreover, the upper storeywas almost entirelymade of wood. Wall sidingswere sometimes of wooden panelsadorned with ovalor rectangular, tray-likeforms calledbandejado. The caladoswere broadened and extendedfrom postto post, and the irfretworktook the form of but terflies, flowers, or lyres, which, with a play of lights, could castdecorativeshadows. Floralmotifswere abundant alloverthe exterior, enrichingthesurfacesofsoffitvents, corbels, and irongrilles. Hence, this styleof the bahay na bato, which appeared between the 1880 s and 1930 s, was aptlytermed the floralstyle, typifiedby the houses of the Pamintuans (Angeles), Tecsons (San Miguel de Mayumo), Bautistas(Malolos), Tanjosoy-Bautistas (Malolos), and by the in teriorsof the houses of the Pastors(Batangas City)and Avenidos (Alaminos, Laguna).

The allocationof urban space along the linesof land use and socialor ethnic divisionswas a crucialissueintheurbanizationprogram of the colonialauthority duringthe nineteenthcentury. The competitionoverurban space between stone edificesresidentsand those in nipa dwellingsbecame more apparent with the mass exodusofthe elitepopulationfrom the confinesof Intramurostothenearby suburbs, which in effectdroveaway the nipadwellersfrom the iroriginalsite. The rootof the urban discordbetween the two was simple: the structuresmade of botanicalmaterials, especiallynipa shingles, were highlyflammable.

Itstipulated thatstone buildingsshould, at allcosts, be protectedfrom the dangers posed by the nipa houses. Areas zoned for stone edificeswere delineatedas zonas de mamposteria. In areas designated as such, the flimsynipa structureshad no place. The colonialgovernment considered each stone edificea significant in vestmentby the owner and an important source of tax revenue, which filled municipal coffers. Moreover, the absence of nipa houses in land parcelswith stone houses was expectedto fetcha highermarket value. Land speculation, for in stance, fueledthe idea of making Binondo an exclusiveareaforstone houses. Thus, from the 1830 sonward, nipa houses were transferredto San Jose,(Trozo) and a demarcation linesixty-fivemeterswide between Binondo and Tondo was establisheda kilometerfrom the shore.

Colonial Waterworks and Utilities Beforetheinstallationofa piped-in watersystemofferedbythemunicipallyoperated Carriedo waterworks in 1882, Manila’spopulation were entirelydependent on surfacewatersupplies, such as riversand superficialwells, which were dangerously polluted. As water coursed through denselypopulated riverbankcommunities, it was subjectto frequentand dangerous contamination. Potable water could be obtained by channeling rainwaterfrom the roof to household cisternscalledaljibe. These cisternswere usuallybuiltofbricksor adobe and contained enough water to lastforweeks. The water for dailyconsumption was drawn by means of pails and keptinsmallerearthenjars(tapayan)to which small alum crystals(tawas) were added for purification. This water was used chieflyfordrinking. But thissystem was not always dependable and could not guaranteea constantsupplyofwater as itwas heldhostagetotheunpredictability of meteorologicalphenomena. The Pasig Riverreadilyprovidedthecitywithcopiouswatersupply. The waterwas used directlyintheriverforwashing clothesand bathing, or transportedto houses for drinkingand domestic purposes. From the riverto the houses, water was conveyed through variouscumbersome methods. Those who residednear the brinkwould merely filltheirbanga (earthenwater vessels)with water from a significantdepth, afterwhich they would coverthe mouth of the vesselwith a cleanpieceof cloth. Those who livedfarfrom the riverhiredprofessionalcargadores (water carriers). Inthedistrictof Tondo, particularlyamong thosewho residedon the for eshore, the riverwater was distributedamong itsresidentsby means of a smallwatercraft called Junday. This nativeboat was brought in to the Pasig Riverfrom upstream, where the water was supposedly clean, then filledwith water. Then itwas pulled down the stream in to the Manila Bay by an empty boat runby one or two paddlers. Upon reachingthebeach of Tondo, the waterwas loaded in to cargahan (wooden SPECTACLE OF POWER 175 cans)to be distributedamong the houses. One carga(two cans)was paid two centavos. Initsunpurifiedstate, the waterwas used for general washing, cleaning, and bathing. For drinkingand cooking purposes, the water underwent some technique of purification: filtrationand applicationofalum and sulfur. Filtrationwas done by tyinga pieceofdrycleancloth, usuallyundershirtortablecloth, around the mouth of the vessel; waterwas then poured, sievingthevisiblesedimentsand impurities. But even afterfiltrationthe water remained turbid. To make the water clearer, alum was added to the filtratecontainedinlargevesselsresultingintheprecipitation of suspended impuritiesatthebottom of the vessel. Aftersome time, the resulting supernatantliquidwas deemed fitfordrinking. For storagepurposes, the alum- treatedwater was in fusedwith sulfur.

Parsons,1911 Architectureand Urban Design in the New Tropical Colony of the United States (1898-1946) Framing the Imperial Imagination The demise of the Spanishempire at the end of the nineteenthcenturyenabledthe United States, through the Treatyof Paris, to acquirethe Philippines, along with otherislandpossessions. Such shiftofcolonialpower signaledtheadventofpseudo- Hispanic Mission styleand the Neoclassicstylein the Philippinearchitectural scenography. This stylisticalliancegave continuity, ratherthan disruption, to a form of government thathad changed from Spanish to American colonialrule. The neoclassicstyle, in particular, servedasa visiblenarrativeofimperialambition and culturalattainmenttranscoded in America’smodern and imported building material—the reinforcedconcrete. Colonial Mission Revivaland Monumental American Neoclassicismwere declared by the United Statesas itsofficialstyleinitsimperialenterpriseinthe Philippines at the beginningofthe twentiethcentury. The Mission Revival, a stylethatswept America in the 1890 s, manifested itspresence in itiallyin the works of Insular Architect Edgar K. Bourne through the romanticevocationof America’s Hispanic heritagefrom Southwesternfrontiers. Thisstylewas furtherarticulatedby William E. Parsonswithinassociationistaestheticcredo thatspawned hybridarchitecture in the Philippines. Thiswas, of course, in compliance with Daniel H. Burnham’s architecturalprescriptionto profuselyuse localbuildingmotifsinthe designof statearchitecture. Adhering to Burnham’s classicisturban master planfor Manila and Baguio, pensionado Filipinoarchitects, like Juan Arellano, Tomas Mapua, and Antonio Toledo, upon finishingtheirarchitecturedegreesabroad, went on to design public buildingsin the grammar of Beaux Arts. They were the same personalitieswho would eventuallytakeoverprominent positionsinthe Bureau of Public Works as architects. From the drawing boards of the searchitects, there emerged a reformationofspatialecologyand perpetuationofstylisticconcoctions that take the visiblepoliticsof architectureto the highestordersto declarethe ascendancy of America as a new world power, itscivilizingpresenceand itspledge to spread democracy acrossthe globe. Corollaryto this, an imperialself-image became more evidentwith the on slaughtof architectureand images mimicking European and Roman descentthatwas developedforthefairsthatsubsequently bombarded the American popular consciousness.

Inthewords of architecturalhistorian Gwendolyn Wright: Administratorshoped that preservingtraditionalstatus-hierarchies would but tresstheirown superimposed colonialorder. Architects, in turn, acknowledging that resistanceto new forms isoften based on affectionsforfamiliarplaces, triedto evoke a senseof continuity with the localpastintheirdesigns(1991, 9). Similarly, in the manufacture of American colonialarchitecture, an associationist stylewas sought by Parsons as a responseto Burnham’s recommendations to 198 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 5.2 Daniel H.

Such stylisticcrossbreedingwas no mere accidentinthe creationof an of ficial architectureof the colony, as the buildingassumed an ideologicalpositionthat made colonialismappear as the continuityof localcultureratherthan a rupture.

Itisa strategythatdisruptsthevisibilityofthecolonialpresence and makes the recognitionofits authorityproblematic. The Roots of American Imperialism Inretrospect, the United Statesby 1898, likethe nationsof Europe, was caught in a wave of imperialism. With itsvictoryinthe Spanish-American War, the United Statessuddenly became a colonialpower and laiditsclaim to the status of world power. Priorto the war, the United Stateshad taken an isolationistapproach to world affairs. However, the ideology of Manifest Destiny, the desireto demonstrate itsstrengthand power, and the desireto in creaseitswealth prompted the United States government to commence itsown imperialistregime at the turn of the century. IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 199 Territorial expansionism was not new to America, but ithad always limited itselfto the North American continent until the federal Census Bureau announced the closing of the western frontiers in 1890. The census made certain that the United States had filled out the entire continental domain, compelling the nation to search for new lands overseas. The spiritof Manifest Destiny, which had remained pervasivesincethefounding of the American Republic, reacheditspeak duringthe lastdecade of the nineteenth centuryto rationalize America’soverseasexpansion. The phrase was coined by New York journalist John O’Sullivanin 1839, when he wrote that “itwas the nation’smanifestdestinyto overspreadand to possessthewhole of the continent which Providencehas givenus for the development of the greatexperiment of libertyand federatedself-governmententrustedto us” (O’Sullivan 1839, 426). Democratic republicanismwas feltto be the bestform of government and God’s plan for mankind, and so itwas believedto be an obligationto in troduceitand “freedom” to as broad an areaas possible. Manifest Destinyprovidedan idealistic and benevolentrationaleforexpansionthan mere ambition for land. Moreover, itwas alsoduringthisperiodthatpowerfuladvocates of imperialism began to surfacein America’spopularimagination. In The Law of Civilizationand Decay, Brooks Adams calledupon the idealsof Social Darwinism, assertingthat “not to advance isto recede”and, the refore, in or der to survive, America must expand. Thus, America’snationalsurvivalwas equated with the triumphant march of the whiteraceacrossthefaceof the earth. To expand isto thrive; to stayhome isto exposeoneselfto be unfitfortheglobalcontest. The United Statesfeltthatit had to partakeinthe European raceforempire. Asidefrom a sourceforcreating mercantilistempires, colonieshad become a symbol of nationalstature.

Afterdefeating Spain in 1898, America was uncertainas to what to do with the Philippines. The debate ragedbetween the expansionistsand the anti-imperialists asthe Treatyof Pariswas beingsignedin December 10,1898. Leaningtoward the impenalistpersuasionand imploringdivineguidance, President Mc Kinleyexplained publiclyhisdilemma as to how to proceed with the Philippines: | didn’twant the Philippines, and when they came to us, asa gift from the gods, |did not know what to do with them...|went down on my knees and prayed to Almighty God for lightand guidance more than one night. And one night lateitcame to me thisway... that we could not give(the Philippines)back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable; that we could not turn them over to France or Germany—our commercial rivalsinthe Orient—that would be bad businessand discreditable; that we could not leavethem to the mselves—they were unfitfor self-government—and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over the reworse than Spain’swas; and thattherewas nothing leftforus to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and upliftand civilizeand Christianizethem, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellowmen for whom Christalso died. And then |went to bed, and went to sleepand sleptsoundly” (Rusling 1903, 17). Inthisbriefstatement, Mc Kinley had summarized the motivatingideasbehind imperialisminthe Philippines: nationalhonor, commerce, racialsuperiority, and altruism. What began asa heroicprojectto liberatethe Philippinesfrom the tyrannyof Spanishimpenalismsoon changed in toa struggletoquellthe Filipinoindependence movement. The United Statesfacedstrong, armed resistancefrom the supporters of the Philippine Republic. In February 1899, the Republicdeclaredwar on the United States, fightinga conventionalwar for severalmonths and then resortingto guerillawarfareinresponseto major lossesagainstthe Americans. By April 1902, the war had ended, with the United Statesvictorious, but unable to quellthe nativediscontentthatfueledguerillawarfare. In the Aftermath of the Philippine-American War Afterdefeatingthe Filipinoguerrillas, the American occupation regime began the massive rebuildingofthe Philippinesalong the American model and planned an entirebatteryof in frastructureto facilitateventuresin militarycontrol, public health, education, and commerce. The establishment of the colonial administrationand of the in frastructureof American rulein America’snew tropical IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 201 possessionwas implemented through two Philippine Commissions. Initially, a militarygovernment was establishedto conduct variousmodes of pacificationin the region. The American troopspledgedfreedom and a more civilizedway of life. The Filipinos, with the exceptionof those who rebelled, responded with great optimism. However, to actualizethiscivilizingscheme, Americans had to supplant the existingculturalsystemthroughtheestablishmentof new sociopoliticalcntena under the persuasivetheme of“benevolentassimilation.” On August 15,1898, allpublicworks were placedunder the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The corpstook chargeofall publicworks under the military government of General Arthur Mac Arthur. The in frastructureand buildingsof Manila and otherurban centerswere appraisedand thosethatincurreddamage from the aftermathofthe war were repairedimmediatelytomake them serviceable. The Philippine Commission, headed by Judge Howard Taft, was in controlofthe development and improvement of the islandsand eventuallytook overthe civil administration. Taft was appointed as the firstcivilgovernor-generalof the Philippines. Soon, the commission generouslydeployeditsresourcestorehabilitate the colonialcity, restoreand improveexistinginfrastructure, and in troduceurban strategiesthat assured a comfortable, healthy, and securesettlementfor the anticipatedinfluxof American population.

Camp Wilhelm in Lucena, Quezon, and Camp Daraga (laterrenamed Regan Barracks) in Legaspi, Albay, rounded out the American militarypostsin Luzon. Inadditionto headquarters, of ficers’housing, and enlistedmen’s barracks, the camps also had armories, warehouses, messes (sometimes locatedwithinthe barracks), of ficersand enlistedmen’s clubs, hospitals, commissaries, post exchanges, recreationalfacilities, and a chapel.

The constructionof permanent structuresin Fort William Mc Kinley in 1905 was hailedasthesecond largestmilitarycantonment in the world (nextto the British cantonment in Aldershot). It“heads the listofgreatmilitaryreservationswhich accommodate troops continuously, and in the matter of modern facilities, buildings, etc., itissaidto be faraway the greatestof allreservationsof this character”(Far Eastern Review, October 1905, 124). The wooden buildingson the reservationwere designedby Harry Allyn, the Supervising Architect, ina style that bore resemblance to American Swiss cottagesor chalets. The structures, to taling 198, were “plannedforthecomfortand physicalwell-beingof the troops, and to meet the climaticand otherprevailingconditionsinthesetropical Islands” (ibid.). The wood-builtstructuresprincipallyutilized Oregon pine, excepttheposts, which were of nativehardwood. The militaryarchitectureof Fort Mckinleywas essentiallycharacterizedbytheabundant useofgalleries, balconies, largewindows, and clapboards.

The firstactapproved by the Philippine Commission on September 12, 1900 was the appropnationof $1 millionfortheconstructionofroadsand bridgesinthecolony to open up new territory. Initially, alaw was passed and adopted that required “everyable-bodiedman in the Islandsto givefivedays of laboreach yearon road constructionand maintenance, or, in lieuofthat, to pay a sum equivalentto the localcost of such labor”(Forbes 1928, 199). In the cityand quaint suburban districtsof Manila, overnightchanges and improvements had taken place since 1898. The citywas mapped and public works were startedfornew citystreets. Some of these urban in terventionsby early architectswere misdirected, such astheplanto demolish the Intramuroswallsto use the stonesforpavingthenew streets. The colonialauthorityinitiallydevalued the Walled Cityof Intramurosas an “obsoletefortificationof the middle ages, the wallsofgraystonewith parapetsand bastionsimposing enough and picturesque, but utterlyvaluelessagainstmodern artillery.”Moreover, the healthauthorities singledout the stagnant moats surroundingthe edges of the wallas a breeding ground for malaria-carryingmosquitoes and recommended thatthe moats be filledwithearth. In 1902, the Municipal Board petitionedthecivilgovernment for permissionto open suitablegatesintotheold Walled Cityasthenarrownessofthe approaches caused greattrafficcongestion. Plansfortheseopenings were drawn by Major Sears and Captain Mc Gregor of the Corps of Engineersand were authorizedby the Philippine Commission by virtueof an act. The partof the wall that was torn down was, according to authorities,“the leastpicturesqueand obstructivetocommerce and itsremovalwas regardedasa necessitytotheprogress of business.”The portionremoved was along the riverfront, extendingfrom the Fort Santo Domingo Gate to ward Fort Santiago. Thissection“obstructedtheuse of the riverfor wharf purposes and additionalwharf facilities... regarded as imperativeby the Commissioners” (New York Times, May 19, 1903, 8). IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 207 The effortto demolish the historicwallsand drainthe moats of Intramuros was alsoprompted by a healthimperativedictatedby Manila’scolonialsanitarians, whose convictionsresounded by virtueofa historicallyuninformed argument: “The wallsare historicallynot of greatimportance, beinga littleover a hundred years old, and sentiments should not be allowed to in terferein the course of progress, and in the matter which affectsthe health of tens of thousands of people” (Ballentine 1902, 72). The move to wreck the wallsof Intramuros stirredmuch controversyto a point necessitatingpresidentialarbitration. To resolvethe matter, President Theodore Rooseveltrequestedlandscape architect B. R.

A militaristicsanitarysurveillanceinthecitywas dispatchedthrough the Bureau of Health. With a high degreeof efficiencyand frequency, thissanitary battalionwent on a house-to-houseinspectionand arrestedsuspectedcarriersof the pathogen for quarantinedetentionat the San Lazaro. Plague houses and buildingsincapableofthorough disinfectionand rehabilitationwere seton fire. The burningofinfectedhouses resultedinthecompleteeradicationofthe plague.

The Insular Ice Plantwas directedto in creasethe outputofdistilledwater to the maximum, whilethearmy distributedwater in districtswithout citywater supplyand closed wells. The nativepopulationviewed the situationwith contempt and “imagined thatthe healthauthoritieswere at temptingto poison them.” But the irfearswere soon dispelled.

The burningofthe nipashacksto contain the epidemic, in most in stances, provoked greatresistanceand hostilityamong. the poor nativepopulace. The secretaryofinterior, in hisreportto the US Secretary of War, remarked of the cholerasituationinthecity: For weeks the presence of cholera was denied by the ignorant, misinformed, and ill-in tentionedperson. The more ignorant Filipinos refusedto believeof itsexistencebecause the dailydeaths did not reach up to the thousands. The minds of the common people were poisoned by talesof horribleabuses in the detentioncamps and the deliberatemurder of patientsat the cholerahospital. The storywas widelycirculatedthatthe houses of the poor were burned in or derto make room for futuredwellingsand warehouses for rich Americans. These absurd talesgave credence among the populace, and to gether with some actualabuses committed by ignorant, in experienced, or overzealous health in spectors, produced a state of popular apprehension, which proveda veryseriousfactorinthe situation, as itledto the concealment of the sick, the escape of contacts, and the throwing of dead bodies into the esterosand the Pasig River, the pollutedwaters of which were fruitfulsourcesof in fection(Secretary of Interior 1902,19).

Bubonic plagueand cholerawere foughtby the American proconsuls with paramilitaryfirmness. Ordinances were issuedto regulateand modify vernaculardwellings. Thisbroughtmany technologicalchangesto Filipinodomestic spaceforthematerials, layout, construction, and servicesofthenipahouseswere found by the colonistto be in consistentwithcolonialsanitation. Buildingswere made ratproofin responseto plague-carryingrodents. In 1905, the city’s Building Ordinance, which brimmed with provisionsagainsthouse in fectionswas passed. Thisstringentlyfixedtheminimum standardsand stipulatedmedicalizedguidelines for house density, illumination, ventilation, and waste disposal. The concept of the to iletwas in troducedin 1902 among dwellersof the bahay kubo in Manila by way of the pailsystem or cubeta. In the absence of metropolitansewers, the systemprovidedeach householdwithwooden buckets, which were collecteddaily by the municipal excrement wagons. Publictoiletsheds were also in stalledin congested nipa districts. A latrinesystem for remote areaswas alsodeveloped based ona vernaculartoiletstructurefound in Antipolointhe Provinceof Rizal. IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 211 To put an end to the unsanitarypracticeofbathingand washing in the esteros, the authoritiesestablisheda new type of communal architecturethatcombined the functionsoftoilet, bath, and laundry, with a continuous supply of clean water. The firstpublicbath and laundry, a one-storeystructuremade of concrete, was builtin 1913 at Calle Lipa in the districtof Sampaloc. As a measure againstovercrowding, filth, poorventilation, and fire, the Americans in troducedin 1908 the neighborhood concept known as “Sanitary Barrios”which permittednipa houses to be builton highlyregulatedblocksof subdividedlots. Each sanitaryblock had a built-in system of surfacedrainage, publiclatrines, publicbath housesand laundry, and publicwaterhydrants, which could be availed of by the residentsfreeofcharge. Imprintsof the sebarrioscould stillbe seen in Sampaloc, San Lazaro, and Vito Cruz. With the successofthe sanitarybarrios, the American authoritiesfocused their effortsto modernizing the Filipinohouse.

While expressions in in teriordesigncontinued to some stylisticvariantsderivedfrom either Greek Revivalist Neoclassicismor the long, curving, dynamic, floralrhythmiclinesofthe Art Nouveau, domesticarchitecturewas a productofa closecollaborationbetween the architect/maestrode obras and the sculptor. As an alternativeto the bahay na bato, the Americans in troduced a new domestic typology—the “tsalet”—to createa lessformal dwelling design. As stated earlier, the tsalet’sdistinguishingfeature was the extended veranda. Inside, bedrooms were laidout on a row on one side perpendicular to the front while livingand dining rooms and the kitchen were laidout on the other. In 1912, the Bureau of Healthdrew up the plansforsanitaryhabitationsusingthe tsaletprototype. These plans, draftedby George H.

The Pasig Riverwas alsowidened to seventy-sixmeters up to the Bridgeof Spainand the river’sintermediatearterialcanalswere deepened to 5.5 meters. The placesfrom above the Ayala Bridgeto Laguna de Bay shoal were dredged to a two-meterdepth to allowfor lowwaternavigation. The highlight of this plan, which was neverrealized, was the constructionof at hroughdrawbridge overthe Pasig River, nearitsmouth. Thissteelbridge, witha double-trackrailway, two wagon roads, and two footwalks, was to reston threeconcretepiersand two abutment piers. The construction of two breakwaters as part of the port improvement project transformed Manila’s in famous reputation as the worst major port for freight in the Orient. The harbor metamorphosed from an open roadstead into a secure closed harbor. An area within the breakwaters was dredged; the refuse material from the process was used to fillinground for anew commercial districton what were, before the arrivalof the Americans, shoals in frontofthe shoreline of Manila.

The rigorousinventory of Manila’sstreetnames, which tracedtheirtoponymic or igins, was undertaken by Col. H. O. S. Heistand of the US Army when he was stationedinthe Philippines between 1902 to 1903. The Military Information Divisionin Manila issuedthe listingin 1903. The firstconcretesteptoward suburban expansionwas taken in the firstdecade of the American occupation when the in fluxof American migration, mostly of businessmen, militarymen, and civilservants, became more remarkable. The creationof new residentialenclavesoutside of Intramuros was undertaken by Henry M. Jones, an American entrepreneurwho founded the American Hardware and Plumbing Company. Jones saw the potentialof the swampland south of Luneta. Inthisarea, the rewere a few permanent structuresalong Calle San Luis, Calle Real(M. H. del Pilar), Calle Alhambra, and otherstreetsalong the bay, while the restwere mainly nipa districtsbuilton undrained land. Jonesbought most of the areas of Paco and Malate and did hisown reclamation. Jones filledthe low partsand subdivided the area into lotsforsalefrom P 1.00 to P 2.00 a square meter and of feredthem on in stallmentbasis. Asidefrom Americans, Jones’buyers in cluded wealthy familiesfrom the provinceswhose childrenwere enrolledin privateschoolsin Manila and Filipinoprofessionals, many of whom were doctors, dentists, and lawyers. To in scribethe subdivided space with the nimbus of American presence and to underscore the enclavistbearings of the new neighborhood vicinity, Jonesnamed the streetsafter American statessuch as California, Carolina, Colorado, Dakota, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Vermont—names of home statesof army volunteerswho fought in the Philippine- American War. These streetnames are stillbeing used to day in the districtsof Malate and Ermita. The districtsoon became Manila’s fashionable residential center. IMPERIALIMAGININGS 225 Edgar Ketchum Bourne, the Insular Architect On May 11,1901, the pressureofarchitecturalproduction and rehabilitationof buildingsprompted the Philippine Commission via cablegram to requestthe Secretaryof War to appoint a competent architectto head the Bureau of Architecturetobe createdbythe Commission (Reportofthe Philippine Commission 1902, 422). Incompliance with thispetition, the Secretaryappointed architect Edgar Ketchum Bourne, who arrivedin Manila on October 10, 1901.

Furthermore, he went on to developa stylepredicatedon the extant Spanish built-heritageof Manila in or derto dispensea senseofimperialnostalgiaand in stilldomestication of the localstyles. To shelterthe novelgovernment programs, the American colonialgovernment generatedmany new buildingtypesthatnecessitateda “new architecture.”Inthe American architecturalschema were public school buildings, sanitariums, schoolhouses, universities, municipalhalls, hospitals, in dustrialplants, prisons, slaughterhouses, publicmarkets, publicbaths and laundries, and many other publicbuildings. Bourne’s Supremacy and the Colonial Mission Revival A number of the architecturalrevivalspopular in the United Statesproliferatedin the Island. The in itialarchitecturalproduction was exposed to a broad arrayof stylisticinfluences, but on lytwo had surfacedasthemost in fluential. At the outset, 226 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO the rewas the Mission Revival, a stylethatoriginatesfrom the irpreviousexploitsin continentalexpansion. The architectureof Mission Revivalbecame widespread in the 1890 s, takingthe American Southwest by storm. Itsessentialelements—clay rooftiles, adobe, concrete, stucco, gables, arches, and to wers were mimicked in countlessschools, trainstations, of ficebuildings, and residencesthroughout Southern California. Such stylecreatesa visualspringboardthatdaresto reimagine the irvictoriousadvance in the American West where nostalgic Hispanicbuilding iconography and in fatuationwith ruinsprevailed. The American adoption of the Mission Styleinthe Philippineswas fedby the assumption thatthe Philippinesas a for mer Spanish colony shared the same Hispanictraditionwith the American Southwest, thus perpetuatingthe logicof an architecturalanalogue. American architectsintroducedthe Spanish Revivalinterlacedwith vernacularforms as an effectivemeans to createa convincingarchitecturalparadigm thatconveyed the sensitivityand responsivenessofthe colonizersto localculture. Such an established architecturalassociationfurtherlegitimizedthe operationsofcolonial cultural mediations. This venerable architecturesoon became an object of recollectionto be romanticizedand beckoned a returnto the simple, authentic, and pedigreedpast. Buildingsthat embodied the Mission Revivalhad successfullyrummaged, mimicked, synthesized, and adapted architecturalforms and detailsinto a contrivedarchitecturalidiom, superimposing Spanish, Italian, Moorish, and Byzantinemotifson the conditionthat the ygeneratea solarand heat resistive architecture. The Mission Stylewas a readilyexportablearchitecturalstyle, which could easily be replicatedsinceitsessentialcharacterwas expressedstraightforwardly. Itsbold, arched openings and expansive, plain, unadorned, whitewashed stuccosurfaces, which to a certainextentevade finelydetailedcraftsmanship, renderedthestyleto uncomplicated reproduction. Terra-cottatilesorshingleson the roofofa building seemed an appropriatefitfora unique architecturaldesignthatapproximated the builtforms of the American Southwest. The stylisticessentialsof the Mission Revivalinclude: curvilinear, parapeted, or scallopedrooflinesand gabled roofs thatrecalled Spanish Baroque designs; round arched entrances; whiteor slightly tinted, smooth, plasteredwalls; pyramidal terra-cottatiledroofs; exposed roof rafters; arched arcadesand corredors; and, a dominant mirador to wer. Taking rootfrom thisaesthetictrajectory, Edgar K. Bourne designeda number of buildingsthatcharacterizedthe Spanish Revivallineage.

The in itialworks of Bourne in Manila consistedmostlyof extensivealterations, repairs, and additionofexistinggovernment structures. His renovationwork had a strong affinityto Hispanic designs, boldlyexpressedin government buildings, such as the Malacafiang, Ayuntamiento, Intendencia, Audiencia Building, Postigo Building, Oriente Building, Bilibid Prisons, Exposition structuresatthe Expositiongrounds in Ermita(the sitenow occupiedby Robinson’s Place Ermita), San Lazaro Hospital, Santa Mesa Detention Hospital, and a Semaphore Station, as wellas in severalwooden resortcottagesin Baguio. The for ward-looking Bourne seemed to anticipate Burnham’s associationist architecturalphilosophythatsoughtto prescribetropicallyresponsivearchitecture and considerablytook design cues from olderbuildingsof Manila. Burnham recommended: The beautifulroofs of Spanish tileare losingground before the in vasionofgalvanized iron... the reisno doubt thatforpermanent buildingsthe long-lived Spanish tilewillprove more economical... Spanish traditionsaredeservingof acceptance. Ina tropicalclimate costlystructuresput up with granite, marble, or otherbuildingstones, in the manner of publicbuildingsin Europe and America, would be out of place... The old Spanish buildingswith the irrelativelysmall openings, the irwide-arched arcades, and largewall spaces of flat whitewash, possessendlesscharm, and astypesofgood architecture for tropicalservice, could hardlybe improved upon. To ment ion a few examples in Manila: the Ayuntamiento, the Intendencia, the Cathedral, the to wer of Santa Cruz, the circularcemetery at Calle Nozaleda, [and]the in nercourtof the presentconstabularybarracks at Paranaque areespeciallynoteworthy (Burnham 1906, 17). In addition, Burnham advised the use of overhanging storiesfor maximized ventilationand the utilizationof Spanishtilesforroofsnotjustto addressissuesof urban contextualismbut maintaincontinuityand mitigatepotentialresistanceto alienforms as well. Architectshave acknowledged thatresistancesto new forms were of tenbased on the long-standingaffectionand establishedaffinitytofamiliar places, and strivedto in duce a sense of continuitywith the localpast in their designs. They extolledthe virtuesof traditions—of tenresortingto what Eric Hobsbawm (1990) describedas the “in ventionsoftraditions,”which reliedon pageantry or other symbolic expressionsof a rigidsocialorder and concocted artificialrevivalstylesto providea semblance of continuity. Inessence, the apparent respectforotherculturesinvolvedinthe Euro-American imperialventuresaimed to legitimizecolonialpower while preservinga sense of locality in the colonial urban or der. Bourne’s corpus of work was responsive to the culturaland environmental context of Manila. He in troduced the application of concrete and lime masonry and the use of cast concrete or naments which mimicked the familiarlocal building motif. But cement was in short supply and was only used for the important edificesof the colonial government. Cement was then imported from Macau, China, and from IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 229 Japan. A largenumber of his works were builtusing Oregon pine and California redwood, which were shipped from the United States. Sincemany of his structures were constructedusingthesetypes of wood, which were prone to termiteattacks and easilydeterioratedintropicalweather, none of them had survivedto thisday. Even hisiconiccement buildings, such as the Bureau of Science Buildingand the Customs House were reduced to rubbleduringthelastworld war. The Customs House, an L-shaped structureatthecornerof Calle Numamcia and Muelle del Rey, was “an honor to the city”(Manila Times 11 July 1903,1). The constructionofthe edificeexacted$75,000 from the Insularcoffers. Itwas a two- storeystructuretopped by a dome overwhich was a cupola with another gilded dome, which functionedasan observationpointtwenty-sixmetersfrom the ground for sightingsteamers and reportingdepartures.

The citygovernment purchased and completed a half-finishedhospital structureon filledground at Calzada de Vidalleftabandoned as a consequence of Philippine Commission Act. No. 247 which calledforthe creationofa largecivil_ hospital. From the existingframework, Bourne designed a three-storey, Oregon pinestructurefittedwithan electricelevator, electriclighting, sanitaryconveniences, and aseptictank. The cityhall’siconographywas modeled on the basicbahay na bato, except that the ground levelwas constructedof wood fashioned in the American clapboardingtechniqueinsteadofheavystonemasonry. Itwas of ficially occupied on March 7, 1904, and for for tyyears, the said building, which was in tendedfortemporary use, servedasthe Manila City Halluntilitdeterioratedand was replacedby the more familiarneoclassicalstructureof reinforcedconcrete with an iconicmonumental clocktower in 1941, a buildingdesignedby architect Antonio Toledo. Perhapsthelargestof Bourne’sdesignswas the Insular Ice Plantand Cold Storage (1902). So huge and expensive, itwas criticizedas an “unnecessarilyhuge refrigeratingand icemaking plantforthearmy commissary” in or der“to provide suppliesand comfort for Amenicanofficersand troopsnot regularlyappropriated forby [the US] Congress” (Le Roy 1914, 292). The buildingwas constructedto house the Bureau of Cold Storage and Ice Plantcreated under the Philippine Commission Act No. 315 on December 10, 1901. The Insular Ice Plantand Cold Storage, builton the southern sideof the Pasig River, was considered the first buildingof apermanent natureto be erectedby the Americans. Itsmassivebrick masonry was fashionedinthe Mission Revivaliststyle, with low-relieffalsearches and pedimented portalsbearingtheinsigniaofthe Insulargovernment.

Bourne’s Insular Ice Plant was demolished to make way for the superstructureof the Light Railway Transit (LRT 1) in the early 1980 s. Another outstandingwork of Bourne was the Bureau of Government Laboratories Building, which was founded under the Philippine Commission Act No. 156 dated July 1, 1901. Ironically, the Mission Revivalistedificewas devoted to modern scientificresearchand colonialtechno-science. Finishedin 1904, the structure consistedofbiological and chemical laboratorypavilionsoccupying the 24-acre siteof the old Exposition Grounds. The buildingservedas an architecturalset- pieceina largetractthatwas destinedto become a Science Complex and University Town, which would extend from Calle Faura to Calle Herran (now Pedro Gil)in Manila. The Government Laboratory, whose masonry component was joinedby a composite of lime-and-cement mortar, was smoothly plasteredby hand. The foundation wallsof the buildingwere made entirelyof poured solidconcrete. The structural system was radicallynew, usinga method in which, postsdo not extend in to the foundation wall, but, in stead, areto be set on a 9 by g inch sillplate, running continuously around the foundation walls, the foot of each post being letinto the sillby a small tusk and both sillsand post bolted to the foundation with anchor bolts, extendingfour feetintothe concrete foundation wall (Report of the Philippine Commission 1902, 1012).

Bourne’sdesignforthe Government Laboratory, which necessitateda new method and styleof construction, servedas the benchmark for succeedinggovernment buildingsand a testingground for in dustrializedbuildingtechniquesand new materialapplicationscombined with the extensiveuse of nativehand crafting. The handcraftingofornaments usingconcrete, a technique unknown to native skilledworkers, were learnedby the nativesunder the closesupervisionof American master builder David E. Graham. Insupportof the government’smedico-sanitaryagenda, Bourne planned Manila’s hospitalarchitecturealongthepavilionscheme. Thiscan be seeninbuildingssuch asthesingle-storey Contagious Disease Hospitalon the San Lazarogrounds and the Santa Mesa Detention Hospital—wooden buildingsseton masonry foundations. The pavilion-typehospitalwas an American in novationinthe Philippines. The pavilionsystem, asconceivedand advocatedby colonialhealthofficials, consisted of single-storey, ifnot, two-storeyward blocks, placedorthogonallytoa connecting corridor, which might eitherbe straightorenclosingofa largecentralsquare. The pavilionswere amply separated, usuallyby open-airdevices, such as gardens or lawns. Inthewards, naturalcrossventilationwas achievedby oppositerows of tall, narrow windows whose heightreached from floorto ceiling. The pavilion design, which placed emphasis on spaciousnessand naturalventilation, was consistentwith the logicof aerialconveyance of disease upheld by the miasmic the or yofdisease. Also in San Lazaro, the Manila Board of Health commissioned Bourne to design a modern and hygienic morgue with a crematory. This one-storey structure with concrete floors had fitted tables for laying the corpses and autopsy tables with IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 235 5-48 San Lazaro Morgue 5-49 Drawings for the Cholera Hospitalof San Lazaro fn. oy ae -tee Goris fro Cretetite Yousane Fe.

The plans were laterrevivedand redesigned, becoming the Philippine General Hospital.

Ruppel for the great Hamburg-Eppendorf?” in Germany (Philippine General Hospital Medical Center 1986,30). Sincethisbuilding was part of a medical sciencecomplex in the Exposition Grounds where the Government Laboratory was, ittook on the same Mission Revivalaesthetics establishedintheareaby the latter. The main centralstructurehad or nateparapets; the facade design placed emphasis on the planarityof the centralvolume by flankingitwith a pairof protrudingcylindricalvolumes surmounted by a dome which servedas sideentrances; the cylindricaldrum, in turn, was sandwiched by two rectangulartowers capped by a pyramidaltiledroof. The fourpavilionswere zoned for the following: acombined maternityand women’s ward; a general surgicalward; a generalmedical ward; and a ward for nativemen and women. The fourpavilionswere linkedto a two-storeybuildinghousingtheadministration of fices, operatingroom, emergency ward, at tendant’squarters, and a one-storey kitchenand diningroom extension. The hospital, made of Philippine hardwood, was estimatedto cost 240,000 pesos. Due to shortageof funds, plansforthis colossalhospitalbuildingwould be temporarilyshelvedand turnedoverto William Parsons who radicallyalteredand to ned down itsornate Mission Revival architecturebut preserveditspavilionarrangement for what was to become the Philippine General Hospital.

Perhaps, Bourne’s model Filipinohouse servedas progenitorofthe Bureau of Health’ssanitarymodel houses. To maintaina senseofstylisticcoherence, the municipalengineeringdepartment cladtheirdesignsolutionsforthesanitaryarchitectureand publicinfrastructureof Manila with elements of Mission Revivalto harmonize with the works of the Insular Architect. Thus, new buildingtypes, suchassanitarymarkets, publicschools, slaughterhouses, policestations, and prisons, among others, were produced ina IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 239 stylethatwas unerringlya revivalof Spanish Mission designs.

Inprivateconstructions, the aestheticlanguageof Spanish Revivalismpropitiously flourishedinthearchitecturalclimateimagined and craftedby Bourne. One such work was the Episcopal Cathedral of St. Mary and St. John (1905) locatedon Calle Isaac Peral(now United Nations Avenue). Designed by architects Sturgis and Barionof Boston in the Mission Styleand executedby the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Company, the cathedralwas the firstof itskind to be builtentirelyof reinforcedconcrete.

Bourne’spositionas Insular Architectsoon ended in controversy. In July 1903, he was charged before the Office of the Secretaryof Public Instructionwith 240 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 5-54 Episcopal Cathedralof St. Mary and St. John 5-55 Floorplanofthe Episcopal Cathedral of St. Mary and St. John in competence, and the plaintiff, agroup of contractors(Jones, Smith, Grant, and Bryan), representedby Attorney Sutro, pleaded for Bourne’sremoval from of fice “by reasonofhis arroganceand by reasonofhis arbitrariness”(Manila Times, July 17, 1903,1). The government probe into Bourne’scasemade headlinesin Manila’s broadsheets. An American newspaper describedtheinvestigationas“a sensational event”(Manila Times, July 23,1903, 1). But no factualevidencewas presented to substantiate the complainant’s “vague” allegationsthat Bourne was “in competent to hold hisofficeby reasonofhis unfairnessboth to Government and privateindividuals”(Manila Times, July 17,1903, 1). In 1905, with the reorganizationofgovernment agenciesengaged in in frastructural deliveryand architecturaldesign, Bourne fellout of favor, resultingintheabolition of the Bureau of Architectureand Constructionof Public Buildings. This was, perhaps, catalyzedby the submission of Burnham’s reportearlythatyear, which shiftedthe at tentionof the colonialgovernment to a much more auteur-centric and grander urban vision. The positionof Insular Architectwas abolishedand replacedby Consulting Architect, a high-profilegovernment positioncreatedto accommodate Burnham’s favored architect, William E.

In May 1906 by virtueof Act No. 1495, the of ficeof Consulting Architectinthe Department of Commerce and Policewas established. Within the same month, William Parsonsassumed the responsibilitiesleftby Bourne in the newlyorganized Officeof Consulting Architect. Thisgovernment positionmay have been created to fit Parsons’credentials, stemming eitherfrom the recommendation of Daniel Burnham or from an in itiativeby Commissioner Cameron Forbes, head of the Department of Commerce and Police. The new Consulting Architectwas in charge of preparingallthedesigns, drawings, specifications, estimates, and documents for allpublicconstructions. As a supervisorygovernment position, he was also mandated to “exercisegeneralsupervisionover the architecturalfeaturesof Government constructionand of the landscape gardening of publicspaces of recognizedprominence” (Dakudao 1994, 9).

The Bureau of Public Works was soon afterreorganized with fourprincipaldivisions: the Administrative Division; the Designing Division; the Constructing Division; and the Divisionof Architecture, placedunder the direct supervisionof the Consulting Architect. Within thisinstitutionalmatrix, which lasted untilthe outbreak of the Pacific War, American-in fluenced modes of architectural production remained pervasiveamong Beaux Arts-trained pensionado architectswho in heritedthe administration of the Bureau from the American colonial architects.

Exemplifiedby the White Cityat the 1893 Columbian World’s Exposition, the City Beautiful Movement emphasized classicalarchitecturefor public buildings builtaround parks and lawns, the most successfulapplicationof which was the 1901 Plan for Washington, DC. Originsof the Neoclassical Style The styleof neoclassicismwas based on a precisestudy of ancient Roman and Greek buildings. At the heartof thisstylewere the or ders: Doric, lonic, Corinthian, and two other Roman variations, Tuscan and Composite. Each had itsown system of or ganization, composition, and proportion. During the Renaissance, architects rediscoveredthese systems, rigorouslyinventoriedthem, and carefullyappliedthem in new ways to alltypesof Renaissancebuildings. Inthemid-eighteenthcenturyitreemerged as a resultof archeologicaldiscoveriesof the ancientruinsand a renewed in terestin Greek and Roman architecture. Architectsand in tellectualsof the time went on grand to urs, which brought them through the major citiesin the European continent, North Africa, and the near East and into directcontact with the cultures, art, architecture, and artifactsof Greco-Roman civilizations. In the United States, to wards the closingof the eighteenthcentury, Thomas Jefferson, in hisroleas architectand tastemaker, advocated a directreturnto the architectural principlesof Republican Rome as the true course for a new democracy—a classical revival. This shiftin tastecoincidedwith the American Revolution, and the Neoclassical stylebecame closelyidentifiedwith the politicalvaluesof the young republic. This is seen in the civic, in stitutional, and religiousarchitectureof the period. Thomas Jefferson was both a promoter and practitionerof thistype of architecture, as seen in his Universityof Virginiacampus complex. For a time in the mid-nineteenthcentury, the stylesaw competition from variousother architectural“fashions,”such as the Gothic Revivalof Richardson and a nascent movement in a truly American “style”that saw honest expressionof materialsand structurein mainly high-risebuildings.

Burnham romanticallylocated Manila along the linesof Western civilization, and declaredinhisreportin 1906: Yet stillsmallinarea, possessingthe bay of Naples, the winding river of Paris, and the canalsof Venice, Manila has beforeitan opportunity unique in the historyof modern times, to createa unifiedcityequal to the greatestof the Western world with the unparalleled and pricelessadditionof a tropicalsetting(Hines 1972, 46). 246 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO Approved on June 20, 1906, by the US Congress, Burnham’s recommendation in cludedthe establishmentofa centralciviccore with streetsradiatingfrom it, cleaningand development of canalsand esteros(waterways)for transportation, constructionof a bay shore boulevard from Manila to Cavite, the provisionof zones for major publicfacilities, such as schoolsand hospitals, the development of parksand open spacesforrecreationalactivities, and the development of summer resortsnear the capital.

Ithad a centralciviccore; radialsemanating from thiscorewere laidovera gridironpatternand largeparkswere in terconnectedby parkways, allofwhich recommended an architecturalstylefrom which futurebuildingswere to be patterned. A scholarremarked that “ifthe plan had had a chance to be fully executed, Manila would have become the most beautifulcityinthe East.” American historian, Thomas Hines, remarked:“Despite Burnham’s pro-imperialist politicalsentiments, and generally‘imperial’manner of his and all City Beautiful planning, the Manila plan was remarkable in itssimplicityand itscognizance of the Philippineconditionsand traditions. Conciseand straightforward, itstechnical recommendations for streets, parks, railroads, and publicbuildingsechoed much of Burnham’s ideasfor Washington, Cleveland, and San Francisco”(Hines 1972, 43). Burnham’s Manila plan borrowed elementsfrom the Washington, DC plan, as evidencedinthecentralciviccore, where government buildingswere arranged ina for mal patternaround a rectangularmall. The imageryofthe Philippinemall was reminiscentof the nationalmallin Washington, DC and overtlymanifesteda buildingsilhouetteof a capitolakinto that of the American Capitol. Completing the civicensemble were the Hall of Justicecomplex, locatedsouth of the mall, and semipublic buildings, such as libraries, museums, and permanent expositionbuildings, allalong a drivetowards the north. To directlyquote from the proposal: Among buildinggroups, the firstinimportance, the Government or National group, which would in cludethe Capitol buildingand the department buildings, islocatedon the present Camp Wallace and the adjacent land back of Calle Nozaleda. Grouping itselfclosely about the capitolbuildingat the center, itforms a hollow square, opening out westward to the sea. The gain in dignityby grouping thisbuildingsina singleformal mass has dictatedthisarrangement, the beauty and convenience of which has been put to the testin notable examples from the days of old Rome to the Louvre and Versaillesinmodern times (Far Eastern Review March 1907, 326). The easternfrontof the Capitolgroup faced a semicircularplaza, from whose centerradiateda streetsystemcommunicating with allthesectionsofthe city—an arrangement entirelyfittingforboth practicaland sentimentalreasons: practical, because the centerof government activityshould be readilyaccessiblefrom all sides; sentimentalbecause everysectionof the capitolcityshould look with deferencetoward the symbol of the nation’spower. The plazaallowsspace at its centerfora nationalmonument of compact plan and simplesilhouette. Radiating from this Government Center was a seriesof radialboulevards superimposed on an efficientgridironstreetsystem.

While hisarticlefocuseson the urban modificationsthatwere to be performed in Manila, itinadvertentlyexposed hisstrongimperialistpredisposition. At the in itial passages of the essay, Burnham observed the absence of an urban plan in the previouscolonialregime: In Manila, in the time of Spanish dominion, was an old walled city situatedon the shores of Manila Bay, at the mouth of the Pasig River. There was no plan by which the citywas built, and, as a result, the placewas i/l-suitedfortheabode of whitemen (emphasis mine). The plans for the development of the cityshould make it, not only healthful, but beautifulas well(Burnham 1906, 7). Inthispassage, Burnham brieflydeclaimed hisversionof Manila’shistory. The lack of planning during the previouscolonialera led to an urban accretion, renderingthecityinhospitableto “whitemen.” Itcan be surmisedthat Burnham’s plan was generatedfrom an imperialistdesireto transformthe Philippinespace in toa placewhere “whitemen” can feeldisease-freeand reimagine America ina tropicalmilieu.

The greatenthusiasm to develop Baguio as a place of American refugeand recuperationmotivatedthecostlyconstructionof Kennon Road, undertakenfrom 1901 to 1905. This two-milliondollarroad leadingto a ten-room sanitariumin Baguio exacted hundreds of human livesfrom Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese road laborers. Baguio was declaredby the Philippine Commission on June 1,1903, asthesummer capitalof the archipelago. Inaccordance with the declaration, Baguio would be transformed in toa new cityconceived, planned, built, and maintained by the Americans for the comfort and enjoyment of Americans. Burnham’s Baguio plan provided for thisfunction, with emphasis on the city’s tripartiterole—asa healthsanitariumfor American servicemen, as a largemarket center, and as a hub of recreationalactivities. The proposalfor Baguio had three objectives: 1. To provide a streetsystem adapted to the changing contours, allowingeasy communication, and avoidingeast-westand north- south or ientationof buildinglines; 2. To provide suitablelocationsfor public, semipublic, and private in stitutionsof importance; and, 3. To providerecreationalareasinthe shape of playgrounds, parks and open esplanades, and parkways. Inessence, the Baguio Planwas dominated by an ellipticalspace approximately 1.6 kilometersinlengthand 1.2 kilometersinwidth, an expanseofnatural level land in the urban reservation. Along the perimeterofthe ellipse, Burnham siteda commercial districtand a government center. The centralportionof the areawas reservedfora publicpark.

Burnham and Anderson admitted thatthe Baguio Planwas fragmentarydue to the absence of surveys. Nonetheless, throughout the earlydecades of American ruleinthecolony, the planprovidedan in fluentialurban templateintheorganization of space within Baguio City. Baguio was a hillstation, a siteof refugeinventedby the colonialistitself. Hill stationswere smalltowns carvedfrom the rockymountainsidesor nestledinthe meadows of high-altitudeplateausand whose genesiscouldbe tracedassanitanum or convalescentcenters. Baguio, in itstransformationas a colonialhillstation, to a certainextent, recreatedthe aura of the mother country in architecturaland urban planningterms asan antidotetothecolonists’longingforhome. The style and at mosphere of an American mountain resort, particularlythe Adirondacks, was consciouslyreplicatedin Baguio. The relativelyhigh-altitudehillstationwas designed to be more than justa reinvigoratingmountain retreat. To justifythe expensesforitsdevelopment, Baguio had to havesome medicalfunctionsofsorts to substantiatean of ficer’stakingrecuperativeleave, however unconvincingthe excuse or in effectualthe cure. Some Europeans, in buildingtheircolonialhill stations, believedthat tripsto the cooleruplands strengthenedtheirimmune systemsagainstinfectioustropicaldiseasesand decreasedtheirsusceptibilityto depression.

William Edward Parsons was born in Akron, Ohio, on June 19, 1872. He graduated from Yale in 1895 where he earned an arts degree and entered the School of Architecture of Columbia Universitywhere he received his master’s degree in Architecturein 1897. At Yale, one of hisclassmates was Francis Burton Harrison, who became a governor-generalofthe Philippines. Parsons was awarded a Mc Kim fellowshipwhich enabled him to study for threeyearsat the Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris. Parsons returned to New York Cityin 1901 where he was employed as head draftsman in the of ficeof architect John Galen Howard. Parsons arrivedin Manila on November 17, 1905. But itwas only on May 26, 1906 thatthe Philippine Commission Act No. 1495, establishinghispositionand defininghisdutiesas Consulting Architect, was promulgated by the Philippine Commission. The position of Consulting Architectwas created under the Department of Commerce and Police. He was to receivean annual salaryof 12,000 pesos. Under the law, Parsonswas tasked“to advisethe Governor-General, the Philippine Commission, the Directorof Public Works, and the Municipal Board of the City of Manila on matters pertainingto the architecturalfeaturesof construction, repair, or alterationof a materialnature of publicbuildingsand 256 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO monuments of permanent character, in cludingthetreatmentofwalls, approaches the reto, the moats, and the areabetween the saidmoats and the boundary streets of Intramuros, and to performsuch otherworks as may be directedby the Secretary of Commerce and Police.”The Consulting Architectwas alsoheldresponsiblefor the for mulationofguidelinesregardingthegeneraltypeand styleofbuildingina particularlocalitywhen publicdesigncompetitionswere to be held. Inaddition, he was to exercisegeneralsupervisionoverarchitecturalfeaturesand landscape designofgovernment and prominent publicplaces. Another importantstipulation of the Actwas thathe was chargedwiththeinterpretationof Bumham’s preliminary plansfor Manila and Baguio and the preparationofthe detailswhere architectural effectsand monumental featureswere required. Section 4 of Act No. 1495 of ficially endorsed the Burnham plan as the canon on which the futuredevelopment of Manila and Baguio would be based. The Burnham plan was, the refore, a law which Parsons’sfuturedesignsmust strictlyobserve. Itwas with in thislegalclause that Parsonsbrought many aspectsof Burnham’s imperialurban visiontofruition. Laterin Parsons’scareeras an urban plannerinthe Philippines, he would draw up hisown urban visionfor the citiesof Cebu and Zamboanga that undeniably resonated Bumham’s planningcntenaasthetwo provincialcitiescalledforshoreline boulevard development, for mulaicciviccoreswith diagonal avenues radiating from the centralhub, and maintenance and in tegrationofold for tsand plazasas urban parksand publicareas. Under the terms of Parsons’sappointment, he was vestedwith the authorityto exercisegeneralsupervisionoverthearchitecturaldesignofall buildingsand parks throughoutthearchipelago, in cludingworksintheinsular, provincial, and municipal spheres. He was alsoallowed to engage in privatepracticeprovided that such would not in terfereinthe dischargeof hisofficialfunction. He maintained an in dependent of ficeduringmost of his yearsin Manila. Parsons’sforemost contributionto localarchitecturewas the improvement of the qualityof constructionmaterialsand techniques. Of course, thiswas achieved through the importationofbuilding technologiesfrom the United States, such as the Kahn Truss System and concrete hollow blocks (Cody 2003, 39) and the adoption of standardizedplansand modularized systemsforbuildingtypes(i. e., markets, schools, dispensaries)to bringdown constructioncosts. Upon hisarmval, he observed thatgovernment standardsof constructionwere poor. Inexpensive Oregon pinewas the basicconstructionmaterialand the beautiful, old tileroofs were beingreplacedbyglaringgalvanizedironsheets. He persuadedthegovemment to discontinuethe practiceof using Oregon pine, which was prone to termite at tacks, and encouraged the useoftermite-resistingtropicalhardwood. He then moved to advocate the use of reinforcedconcreteas the standard construction materialforallgovernment-sponsored architecture. Consistentwiththecolonialgovernment’ssanitaryobsession, the firstbuildingof the government to be executedentirelyofreinforcedconcrete(with the exception of wood window frames and rooftrusses)was the Insane Ward at San Lazaro, completed in 1907. However, Parsons noted the difficultyin expeditingthe constructionofreinforcedconcretebuildingsintheabsenceofskilledlaborfamiliar with concrete’smaterialplasticityand the for mwork itrequired.

The largestindividualstructures Parsonsdesignedwere the government capitol buildings. These were for the provincesof Albay (1907), Pampanga (1907), Iloilo (1907), Capiz, and Laguna (1908). A study presentedinthe Bureau of Public Works Quarterly Bulletin(Vol.2, No.14) in 1914 outlinedthe philosophyof the colonialadministrationregardingthedesignand the locationofthese important civicstructures. Hisconcept and designofthe Lingayen Capitol Building, possibly the most impressiveof allthose builtduringthatera, was an excellentexample from which hisphilosophycan be deciphered.

During this period, methods of constructionwere greatlyimproved through the adoption of new building technologies promoted by the American authoritiesin the Philippines. Improvements in constructiontechnology translatedto largerand tallerstructures that allowed applicationof complex forms of articulationand or namentation. Steel-framedskeletonconstruction, reinforcedconcrete, and concrete hollow block constructionwere the primary constructiontechnologiesimported from the United States. This transferof technologyinthe Philippineswas on lypartof a larger, worldwide technologicaltransmissionof the United Statesthatstartedat the end of the nineteenth century. Catalyzed by the successfulconstructionof the Panama Canal in 1914, the American building in dustrygained world reputation, leading to an aggressiveand massive exportof American expertiseand technologiesto other partsof the world. In hisbook, Exporting American Architecture 1870-2000, historian Jeffrey Cody described the condition as “the first, most visibleexample of how assiduously US companies, planners, government agencies, and other ‘brokers’of American architecturalform and space positionedthemselvesto work in Asia and elsewhere”(Cody 2003, 3). The American colonialperiodsaw the riseof the use of concretein major in frastructure and civicworks in urban and provincialareas. Concrete isa highlyadaptable and plasticmaterial, which can be for med and employed in a range of applications, from massive structuresto the most exquisiteof architecturaldetails. Concrete’s plastic qualityrenders a smooth surfaceand crispplane as well as an in expensiveway to precastreliefornaments. The combination of concrete and _ steel reinforcements resulted in a medium known as ferroconcrete. The added reinforcement provided the needed strength for tensile for ces while the concrete countered compressive for ces. The use of this composite material in new construction meant that structures became taller, with longer spans, CCEMENT and largeropenings. New architecturalforms were “Bestby Test” made possible. The Insane Ward (1906) at San Lazaro, the firstgovernment building to be built of reinforced concrete, spurred the use of such material for privateconstruction. For the fiscalyear ending June 1, 1908, the to tal value of cement imported f ¥ amounted to 1,384,000 pesos (Report of the Cebu Portland Cement Company Philippine Commission 1908,32), and, despitethe yearlyincreasein use, not a kilogram had been manufactured locallyuntil 1915 when the firstrotaryplant for cement manufacture was erected in Binangonan, Rizal, known as the Rizal Cement Company. In 1910, the Municipal Engineerhad observed the remarkableincreasein the adoption of reinforced concretefor privateconstruction. That year, the valueof reinforcedconcretebuildings erectedreached 1,144,050 pesos, an abrupt in creaseof 607,050 pesos over the previous year (Report of the Municipal Board of Manila 1911, 46).

Initially, the demand for concreteforcivicconstructionwas suppliedby manufacturers from Macau, China, and Japan. By the end of the 1910 s, concrete was exclusively imported from the United Statesto the Philippines. Portlandcement, named afterthe quarryinthe United Kingdom from which the maternalonginallycame, was firstproduced in the US in 1872 and became verypopularthereafter. In 1876, duringthe Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, Portlandcement was shown as a viablebuildingmedium and was marketed aggressively. By 1897, US production of cement exceeded that of the importationof cement from Europe. Thus, the American constructionindustryby the 1900 s favoredand depended upon concreteas a primary buildingmaterial. Moreover, a number of American companies ventured into the production of time-saving Gr for the Hisien Race AGreet Bre i fe x 5 The‘Ideal’Hollow Concrete Building Block pean: hes pied ave Re? concrete. In 1906, the Ideal Concrete Machinery Company of South Bend Indiana developed machinery that manufactured concrete hollow blocks on the construction site, known as the “Hollow Concrete Building Block.”Essentially, the machine compacts a fe concrete mixture into a mold to form hollow -: blocks. The machine had vertical cores, fold- down mold sides, and a palletwith cutouts so it would fit over the cores. The pallet was placed at the bottom of the mold and was used to liftthe freshly molded block out of the mold after hand tamping. The company ae Sa aggressivelypromoted and marketed the IDEALCONCRETEMACHINERYco machine as demonstratedin a print ee advertisementdepictingthe global reach of the imported machinery that in cluded the Philippinesas one of itsclientbases. Concrete hollow blocks, as they were stillmanually produced but with the aid of a machine, were feasiblebuildingmaterialsinthe Philippines. The abundance of manual laborresultedin the in expensiveproductionof hollow blocks. These relativelylow-cost blocks became the fundamental buildingmaterialfor constructingwalls and other verticalcomponents. This technology isstillbeing used in the Philippinestoday as it has proven to be an economical buildingmaterialcompared to contemporary building materials, such as drywalls, curtainwalls, and other prefabricatedcomponents. Maciiae and Pios Another important applicationof concrete was in the production of prefabricated components and precastconcrete or naments demanded by the neoclassicaland the artdeco style. This was an important aspect of construction, as a significantamount of decorativefeatures(such as medallions, low-reliefsculptures, statuaries, in serts) were repetitive In nature and, thus, produced in multiples. Originalsculpturesand decorativepanelswere firstexecutedin plasterfrom which a mold was for med for the eventual concrete casting. The or namental components were fabricated in Manila by a specialcorps of fiftyto sixtysculptors and molders working under the supervisionof the Consulting Architect, then shipped to various buildingsitesin the archipelago. In such undertakings, the Bureau hired the master sculptorsand artisans, such as Isabelo Tampinco, Vidal Tampinco, Ramon Martinez, Vicente Francisco, Eulogio Garcia, and Inocencio de Leon among others, to designthe omamental components of the building.

In 1928, for example, the Philippinesimported 23,998 tons of corrugated roofing,11,474 tons of structuraliron and steel,16,316 tons of steelbars and rods plus other iron and steelproducts, such as pipes, fittings, nuts, bolts, washers, nails, and other construction paraphernalia. A report by Consul General Harrington in 1930 showed a considerableincreasein steelproducts imported by the Philippines. Steelbridgeswere erectedduring thisperiod, replacingworn down and deteriorating wooden and stone bridgesbuiltduring the previouscentury.

The British-owned Manila Club was acclaimedby The Far Eastern Reviewin 1908 as “one of the most modern buildingsofits kindinthe Orient.”Located between Calles Nozaleda and San Marcelino, the two-storey, reinforcedconcretebuilding covered an areaofforty-fiveby thirty-fivemeters, with the second floorcovering overone-thirdof the areaofthespreadfoundation. The floorsand in teriorfinishes IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 267 Rersntd 0 Ul a HE were made of local hardwood. The first floor was divided to contain a nine by twelve meter-dining room, ladies’ room, of fice, card room, bar, and billiard hall.

The second floorcontained a largereadingroom and a number of private rooms with a communal to iletand bath. A nineby twelvemeter-swimming pool was added aftertheconstructionof the building. The costof the buildingwas estimatedatabout 75,000 pesos. With the aim of “spreadingthe Christiancivilizationof the West among the, peoplesofthe Orient,”the International Committee of the Young Men’s Christian Association(YMCA) commissioned Parsonsto designitsbuildingin 1909. The YMCA Buildingwas builtatthecornerof Calles Concepcion and Carlos IV, at the rearof the Manila City Hall(presentlyoccupied by SM Manila mall). Parsons dividedthebuildingintothreeclusters: the at hleticbuildingon the right, the main buildingat the center, and the kitchenbuildingon the left. The centralmain buildingwas forty-fiveby thirteen-and-a-halfmeters. The planofthe ground floor was compact and well-maximized, accommodating rooms for dining, billiards, lectures, privateoffices, and a library.

Though Parsonsinitiallyplanned a roofgardenover the at hleticbuilding, he replaceditwith a more practicalhipped roofwith clay tiles. Overall, the projectwas estimatedtocostabout 170,000 pesos, a huge sum at thattime. One of the structures Parsons builtin Baguio was the Brent Episcopal Church for Boys thathe completed in 1909. While Parsons’swork in Manila stressedclassic forms molded in concrete, such as running arcades and pilasters, thisschool buildingwas a simplewood structurethatemployed classicelementsusinglocal materials. A Classical Revivalback porch, for in stance, with Doriccolumns carved out of wood, leadsstudentsinand out of what isnow known as Ogilby Hall.

These buildingswere popularly known as Gabaldon Schoolhouses, a name at tributedto Isauro Gabaldon, amember of the Philippine Assembly who authored 270 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 5-89 Manila Central School (now the Manila Science High School) 5-90 Tondo Intermediate School 5-91 University Hall of the Universityof the Philippinesin Manila 5-92 Standard School Building Plan no.2 5-93 Plan of a Gabaldon Schoolhouse tin]d apenaslst the billappropriating P 1 millionfor the buildingof modern public schools throughout the Philippines. The billwas passed in to law on June 19, 1908, and came to be known as the Gabaldon Law. Materials, forms, windows, doors, and even blackboards were standardized to decrease buildingcosts, save time and labor, and maximize constructionefficiency. Most of the schoolhouses were one- storey high, constructed of 100-millimeterreinforcedconcrete walls on 250- millimetersquare piersthatfunctioned likestilts, in or der to elevatethe flooroff the ground to allow easy in spectionoffloor timbers for possibletermiteattack (Rebori 1917, 433). Capiz windows were reinventedas pivotwindows rotatingon horizontalaxes. Intime, the seschoolhouses became an enduring iconofcolonial education and the program of assimilation. The school architecturecreated by Parsons was commended by Governor-General Forbes for itstropicalattributes and symbolic presence: No other tropicalcountry has at tempted to build up a complete school system with a distinctivetype of architecture... A type of permanent, concreteschool buildinghas been evolvedwhich isvery satisfactory. These permanent buildingsconform to the needsofthe IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 271 see = i 5-94 A standardschoolbuilding: designedby Parsons climate. Unless overcrowded with schoolchildren, they meet the standard setup for school hygiene in ventilation, lighting, and sanitation. They are simple and dignifiedin architecture. They are usually the most conspicuous, as well as the most artistically satisfactory, of the buildingsinany community (Forbes 1928, 192). Parsons’s University Hall(1913) of the Universityof the Philippineswas the first buildingto be erectedon the campus grounds at Padre Faura (Report of the Philippine Commission 1912, 186). The structure, costing 250,000 pesos, measured 58.35 meters long by 25.8 meters wide and consistedof threefloors and an at tic. The foundationwas made upofchain footingsofreinforcedconcrete. Dwarf wallssupported the frameofthe firstfloorand distributedthe load of the frame overthefooting. The University Hallmanifestedtheaestheticshiftofcivic buildingsfrom the austerecombination of Mission Revival, plain, classical Doric or ders with the obligatoryallusiveelements to localarchitecture(i. e., capiz windows) to a more or nate, precastneoclassicismrequiringa complicatedcasting processand moulding technique. This style, however, which architecturalcritic Andrew Rebon had renounced, came closetothe“stereotypedclassicarchitecture,” which stronglypersistedin Parsons’sprivatecommissions when he returnedto Chicago in 1914 (Hines 1973,324-25). Outside, the hallexhibiteda longcolonnade of loniccolumns—ten on the longitudinalsidefacing Padre Faura, and sixcolumns on both lateralfacesof the building. The columns were eighty-sixcentimetersin diameter at the base and taperedto seventy-fourcentimetersatthe capital. The columns were 7.6 metersinlengthfrom the irbase to the base of the cap and were 9.2 metersinlengthoverallfrom the baseofthe pedestalto the crown of the cap.

Fenhagen isbest remembered for the unbuilt Capitol Buildingin Manila. This structurewas supposedly the centerpieceof Burnham’s Capitol Group and a hallmarkof Fenhagen’scommitment toan architecturalstylethatevoked America’s federalpresenceinthe Philippines.

This magnificentvisioncame with an outrageous pricetag: the grand to talof the estimatefortheentiregroup, in cludingthecostofgeneral construction, plumbing, lighting, plansand specifications, and supervisionwas pegged at 6,113,606 pesos (Reportofthe Philippine Commission 1912, 188). Fenhagen, like Parsons, was allowedto engage in privatepractice. Togetherwith Fred Patstone and William James Odom, Fenhagen designed one of the first multi-storeyconcretebuildingsinthe Philippines, the Masonic Temple (1913) in Escolta. The Masonic Temple was a five-storeystructurethat displayed a Neoclassicfacade, with a colonnaded ground floor, arched centralportal, and divided, two-arched Horentinewindows typicalof amultistorey Italian Renaissance palazzo. IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 275 During thistime, Doane was actuallymanaging the of ficeinbehalfof Fenhagen, and soon after, he took fullcharge of the Bureau as Consulting Architectinthelasthalfof 1916. He heldtheoffice for two-and-a-halfyears, assuming management of the projectsthat Fenhagen and Parsons had left behind. He continued to oversee the implementationof the Manila and Baguio master plans. The MIT-educated Doane, like Parsonsand Anderson, was bred in the Beaux Artstradition. He was a Neoclassicistand sought to enhance the qualityofpublicbuildingsas wellas in creasethe richnessofornamentation and articulationforthe most significantstructures. He explained his dispositiontoward the decorativeinhis 1919 articlein Architectural Reviewaptly titled“The Story of American Architectureinthe Philippines.” Intheearlydays, the Americans enforceda bare, severe, undecorated architectureas an antidote for the prevalentgarishtastesof the nativepeople. Such a severearchitectureas isonly permissiblein conjunction with the finestbuildingmaterialswas at tempted in concrete, a materialwhich, though structurallyexcellent, isartistically bastard, and inno way expressesthe nativeluxurianceof the tropics or the prevalentcaseoflifeinthe Far East. Thisarchitecturalprocedure met with localdissatisfactionon every hand. The Filipinoswere willingto be shown a new architectureifitcould be richlydecorated, but were not willingthattheirpublicbuildingsshould be devoid of any embellishmentwhatsoever, littlemore, in fact, than warehouses (Doane 1919, 30).

IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 281 Session Hallofthe Legislative Building Castingthe Imperial Allegory: Sculpted Figuresin Architecture The colonizingpower has long made use of many devicesand agenciesto createan emotional bonding with particularhistoriesand geographies. The culturalmechanism and visualideology of the colonialauthorityhave been directedto nurture several iconicmetanarratives: the spiritof the land; the cultof a hero; the ethicof progress; the rhetoricof benevolentassimilation; and the nurturanceof democratic governance under a colonialorder. These metanarrativesare drivento ensurethe consolidationof the colonialsubjects’pluraland emotive identitiesand the in corporationof peripheral loyaltiesto the body-politicthatisconstructedthough hegemonic culturalconstruction of a collectiveidentity, socialmemory, and socialcohesion. Since places are defined by tangiblematerialrealitiesand spatialcoordinates that anchor identity, places, the refore, are essentialto spatializationof the imagined colonialmetanarratives. They are necessaryin providingemotive sitesof remembrance and in the cultivationof such metanarratives. Carefullychosen symbolic meanings, icons, and mythologies that serveas mnemonic devicesare in vestedin these places. Architecture, monuments, statuary, and public spaces provide venues to establish spatialand temporal referencepointsof remembering that prop socialcontinuityand collectivememory in the colonialcity. As Walzer puts it,“[t]hestate Isinvisible; itmust be personifiedbeforeitcan be seen, symbolizedbeforeitcan be loved, imagined before itcan be conceived”(Walzer 1967 in Zelinsky 1988). Anthropomorphic figuresintegratedin architectureand publicstatuaryserveas visual cues loaded with collectivememory that isgrounded in a mythic past, reifiedin the present, and projectedintothe future; they perform a didacticfunction, allegorically embodying the requiredvaluesthe citizenmust perform for the state; they signify nationalprogress; they are heroicfiguresof men who representfacelessmasses; they are symbolicof rights, liberty, and patrimony. From its classical or igins, monumental public statuary in the nineteenth century cities constituted a mnemonic system of identification transcoded in stone. Historical monuments and civic spaces were didactic urban elements. They were iconographically articulated to civilizeand elevate the aesthetic tastes and morals of the citizenry.

SU SSS The Classical Fenale Figures Cladiin Filipina Dress The conception of women as agents of civilization, education, and eine is” evidentby the in clusionof variousclassicalelementsinnearlyallof the personifications, such as the figures of Ramon Martinez’sfour variationsof La Madre Filipina commissioned for the Jones Bridgeor in hisrenditionof “Inang Bayan” (Mother Nation)surroundedby Greekdeitiesatthepedimentof the Legislative Building. The use of classicaldevices in this statuary proved an idealtoolby which to convey a sense of cultural achievement, since the Greco-Roman word, at that time, was perceivedto be the epitome of sophistication. For the viewerloolingat the personifications, accessories, such as to gas, tunics, sandals, thrones, daises, cornucopia, crowns of laurel leaves, helmets and/or triumphal arches, were in tended to evoke parallelsbetween the enlightenedachievements of the United States and those of the Greeks and Romans, creatingan image of America as the naturalheir to the ancient world. Such a comparison was also suggestiveof an impenal conceit that America’s reignas a world power and great colonizerwould be as successfuland in fluentialas that of Athens or Rome. Pedimentsculpturesofthe Legislative Building Classicaltriumphal devices likearches, elevated daises or crowns of laurelleaves, apart from actingas a kind of imperialfableby way of historicalanalogy, when combined with a background revealingvistasand elementsthatdeclaredprosperityand cultural achievements, were also in tended to revealthe success of the colonizingprocess. Raised or enthroned female figuresclutchingsymbols of fertilityor affluence, such as agriculturalparaphernalia, cornucopia, or commercial ledgers, were meant to draw statelylikenessesto classicaldepictionsof Fortuna (Lady Luck with her cornucopia of promises of richesand abundance). The Philippineswas firstpersonifiedin the 1880 s via Juan Luna’s academic painting Espanay Filipinas, alsoknown as La Madre Espafia Guiando a Su Hija Filipinasen El Camino del Progreso(Mother Spain Guiding the Philippineson the Road to Progress). To dramatizethe march to progresssought by Filipinoreformistsin the 1880 s, Luna used a slim canvas, a for mat that helped focus on the grand steps, scatteredwith palms of victoryand flowers, while also emphasizing the regalpose of mother Spain and daughter Philippineslookingupward to the sky to signifyboth the irhope and ententecordiale. Spain held her ward on the hips as ifguidingher on the irclimb to progress. This mode of figurationwas appropnated in a rotunda in Carcar, Cebu, built in the 1920 s. Here Spain was replacedwith the figureof America but stilldirectingthe Philippinesat the crossroadsto the metonymic road to progress. IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 283 _Ramon Martinez’s(1860-1950) rendition of La Madre Filipinaresonatesthe cultof motherhood, a figurationthat seems to ‘sanctionthe “pastoralpower” (a form of power exercisedby the stateapparatus that focuses on the salvationof subjects). This group of allegoricalsculpturesonce graced the portalsof the prewar Jones Bridge (c. 1930) designed by Juan Arellano for the Bureau of Public Works. Salvagedfrom the ruins of war, one of those in the figural group stands side by side with the Rizal Monument in Luneta, whilethe other now flanksthemain door of the Court of Appeals Hall along Maria Orosa Street. Perhaps, borrowing the personifiedimage of the Philippines from Juan Luna’s figuration, Martinez’smaternalfigure, clad in a Tagalog native costume, is seated on a throne to representthe imperialideals. _ Although clad in baro’t saya, the figure exhibits a discernable classical female facial feature and hairstyletraceable to the likenessof Aphrodite.

Previousto thiscommission, Martinezdid severalimportant publicsculptures, such as the Grito de Balintawak (Cry of Balintawak),1911, or iginallysituatedat the Clover Leaf Bridge, Caloocan City, going to the North Expresswayand now locatedin frontof the Vinzons Hall, Universityof the Philippines Diliman Campus. Martinez completed hisartistictrainingat the Escuelade Pintura, Esculturay Grabado in 1898 and later specializedin sculpture. He alsoexcelledin paintingso much so that his Coming From the Market won a bronze medal at the Universal Expositionheld in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904. Another important personalityin the fieldof architecturalornamentation was Vidal A. Tampinco, son of the great Filipinosculptor Isabelo Tampinco. His firstmajor commission was the Capitol Buildingin Tacloban, Leyte. In 1916, he was commissioned to do the statuary, or namentation, and woodwork for the Legislative Building, the foundations of which had alreadybeen laid. But the projectwas soon abandoned for lackof funds; he resumed work on the Legislative Buildingin 1922. In the in terim, he had been calledto do the statuaryforthe Jones Bridge, and to help in the renovation of the Malacanang Palace. The panelwork and carved ceilingsof the Palace were his work. With his father, he also designed a scalemodel for the proposed Philippine Capitol, which was to occupy the area behind the present Legislative Building. The domed scalemodel was exhibitedat the St. Louis Expositionwhere itwas awarded a medal. Together with Ramon Martinez, Tampinco designed the or namental sculptures of the Legislative Buildingpriorto World War Il. In the same aestheticfigurationof Martinez’s La Madre Filipina, he made the enthroned maternal icona centralfigurein the pediment of the Legislative Buildingwhile being surrounded by a group of Greek mythologicalfiguresin differentpositionsas her counsel, thus in vokingthe guidance of the greattwentiethcenturycivilizationof America. Represented as an archaicroyalty, she holds a scepterof power and isaccompanied by two seatedconsorts, a male and female, on both sides. The male figureisclad in tribalattireand holds a spear, while the female figureisdressedin to ned-down, Hispanizedbaro’tsaya. Here, the nation is depicted as a product of an unproblematic socialcohesion of the Christianized (Hispanized)and tribal, non-Christianizednativepopulation. At the end of the Pacificwar, the Legislative Buildinghad been completelydevastated. In 1949, the edificewas rebuiltentirelyfrom memory, with the aid of a blueprint lackingmeasurements, which had providentiallybeen kept by Tampinco. The architects of the Bureau of Public Works declaredthat the reconstructedbuildingisa replicaof the or iginal, except that itislessornate. Drawing upon the heighteneddictionof classicalfiguration, Vicente Francisco(1865- 1936), a founding facultyof the Universityof the Philippines School of Fine Arts, executed sculpturesgracing the entrances of the differentcollegesof the old UP universitytown in Padre Faura. Sincethe Universityof the Philippineswas the bastion of colonialeducation, hisworks not only sought the evocationof in spirationand a IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 285 5-111 One of the many allegorical sculptures surrounding the quadrangleof the Universityof the Philippinesin Manila circa 1930 senseof historicalcontinuitywith classiccivilizationsof antiquity, but also endeavored _ to communicate among the students a particularkind of colonialconsciousness, responsibility, and conformityto the colonialorder. | Francisco’s Education and Youth, Agriculture, and Law were allfemale figuresthat wore classicaltunics.

Known as the pensionado program, the firstrecipientof the scholarship for architecturewas Carlos A. Barretto, who receivedacademic trainingat the Drexel Instituteof Philadelphia.

Filipino Architects in the Bureau of Public Works Beginning in 1903, the Insulargovernment had launched a scholarship program that allowed Filipinostudents to pursue universityeducation in the United States. Known as the pensionado program, the firstrecipientof the scholarship for architecturewas Carlos A. Barretto, who receivedacademic trainingat the Drexel Instituteof Philadelphia. He worked with the Bureau of Public Works (BPW) from 1908 to 1913 and resumed hisservicein 1917. Due to the lossand destructionof many of ficialdocuments, very littleis known about the lifeand professional accomplishments of Barretto in architectureand civilservice. Joining Barrettoin 1911 was Antonio M. Toledo, who graduated from Ohio State Universityin 1910. Toledo rose from the ranks, and, in 1928, he became the Consulting Architect, a post he held untilhisretirementfrom government servicein 1954. Two other architectsfollowed: Tomas B. Mapua, a Cornell University graduate, in 1910, who worked at the BPW from 1912 to 1915 and from 1917 to 1927, and Juan G. Arellano, a product of Drexel Institutein 1911, who stayed with the BPW from 1916 to 1941. As the yreceivedacademic trainingfrom the US eastcoast, the bastionof Beaux Arts philosophyand pedagogy, itwas expectedthattheirhomecoming would signalthesurgeinthe number of structuresinthe Neoclassicstylethatdeparted from the straightforwardvolumes and sparsesurfacedecorationinitiatedby Parsons.

He startedworking with the Bureau of Public Works in 1911 as a draftsman under William Parsons. In 1915, he was promoted to the position of Superintendent Architectand became Consulting Architect in 1938, a position he held untilhis retirement from government service in 1954. Collaboratingwith Parsons, Toledo designed the Women’s Dormitory of the Philippine Normal School. With Parsons’sdeparturefrom the Bureau, Toledo assumed custody of implementing the designsforthe buildingsof the UP Manila campus, in cludingthe College of Medicine Annex and the University Library. His fidelityto neoclassicism yieldedmonumental and memorable edifices, such as the twin Corinthianbuildingsin Agniina Circlein Luneta, the Leyte Capitol, and the Manila City Hall among others, making him a legitimatemaster of the style. In 1947, he became a member of the Architectsand Engineersmission that to ured the United Statesand South America to prepare for the planning of the Capitol buildingsand the UP Diliman Campus in Quezon City.

Leyte Provincial Capitol(1917) was definedby a high and imposing lonic ten loniccolumns, which stretched building. The outer rows of columns carried the weight of a projecting entablature, whilethe in nerrows were at tached to the front wall. Ornamental detailsand reliefswere executedby sculptor Vidal Tampinco. The front of the structure was approached by a monumental flightof steps. Just behind the colonnade was a public lobby, with a vaultedceilingand arcaded walls, from which a broad staircaseleadsto the spacious Session Hall on the second floorthat extendsup through the buildingby means of a clerestorytreatment. Agricultureand Finance Buildings(1934) were identicalbuildingslocatedon opposite sidesof the Agri Fina Rotunda, which was or iginallyplanned by Burnham as a semi- circularplaza on the easternportion of the National Capitol Buildingsfrom where radialboulevardswere to commence. The concave facade was setoffby grand steps leadingup to the colonnade of sixcolumns with Corinthianmotifs. From there, four huge archways punctuated the facade. Manila City Hall (1941) The constructionof thisbuildingstartedin 1936 and was finishedbeforethe outbreak of war in 1941. Itoccupied a long and almost trapezoidal sitebetween the Legislativeand Post Officebuildings.

He then served as the commander of the main body of Filipino Engineers in the Philippine Revolutionary Army. Activeinpublic — service, he was a councilorfor the City of Manila from 1902 to 1907 and became a member of the Committee for the Revisionof Tax Assessments and Honorary Commissioner to the Saint Louis Exposition. He was reelectedcitycouncilorin 1917 until 1919, Because of Arguelles’familiaritywith local conditions, he was made President of the Board of Appeals of Real Estatein Manila. Afterhe receivedhis licenseto practicearchitectureunder the Engineers and Architects Law of 1921, he became a seniorpartner in the firm Arguellesand Magsaysay.

The eight- storey edifice was one of the major department storesof the period that stood on the corner of Escoltaand David streets. Scholars have establisheda strong similarity between the facade treatmentof thisstructure with that of Luna de San Pedro’s Insular Life Building. In this building, however, the protrudingand chamfered cornerwas plainer in articulation. This terminated in balconies with art deco grillworksand surmounted by bas-relief sculptural panels.

Priorto American colonization, the architecturalprofessionwas essentially embodied by the maestro de obras (literallytranslatedas“masterbuilder’). There was no actualtitleof“architect.”Instead, the maestro de obras was responsible for the constructionand supervisionover the erectionof public and private structures. The nearestform of architecturaleducationduringthe Spanish period was the Escuela Practicay Profesionalde Artesy Oficiosde Manila, which was establishedby the Spanishgovernment in 1890. Among the firstgraduatesofthis schoolwere Arcadio Arellano, Juan Carreon, Julio Hernandez, and Isidro Medina. Later, privateschools, such as the Liceode Manila, was establishedin 1900, grantingtheacademic titleofmaestro de obras. Francisco Agraran, Carlos Diaz, Antonio Goguico, Angel Tampinco, and Zoilo Villanuevawere among the first graduatesofthe Liceo. The Liceo, to getherwith the Academia de Arquitecturay Agrimensurade Filipinas, the firstprofessionalorganizationofarchitects, engineers, and surveyors, founded in 1902, of fereda four-yearcourseincivilengineeringand architecturein 1904. The Mapua Instituteof Technology (MIT) was a pioneerarchitecturalschool establishedin 1925 by Tomas Mapua afterhisreturnfrom the United States. MIT, or iginallya nightschool for working students, of feredcoursesleadingto 298 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 5-121 Pioneer Filipinoarchitects constituting the Philippine Architects Society, later renamed Philippine Instituteof Architects degrees in architectureand engineering. In 1930, the Universityof Santo Tomas (UST) establishedits School of Architectureand Fine Arts. Soon after, Adamson Universityopened itsarchitectureprogram in 1941. That same year, the Philippine College of Design was founded and itrecruitedthe luminariesof the design professionin the Philippinesas itsfaculty. However, the Pacific War halted its Operationand itneverreopened afterthewar. Other schoolsofarchitectureoutside Manila would alsoinstitutearchitecturecourses after World War II, such as the Cebu Instituteof Technology (1946) and Mindanao Colleges(1953). In 1921, the veryfirst Engineersand Architects Act No. 2895 was passed by the Philippine Assembly. Under thisact, two separateboards of examiners (one for engineeringand another for architecture)would be created to oversee the administeringoflicensureexams. Licensedmaestro de obras or “master builders” were alsoautomaticallygrantedthetitle“architect”under a grandfatherclausein the act. Through thislegislation, the practiceof architecturewas of ficially recognized as a professionsubjectto stateregulation. The for mation of the professionalorganizationalsoservedas a unifyingforceamong architectsof the earlytwentiethcentury. The Philippine Architects Societywas establishedin 1933 asa responsetothegrowing number of architectureprofessionalsinthe Philippines. The firstpresidentwas Juan Nakpil, with Tomas Mapua as Vice-President, Harold Keys as Secretary, and Sidney Rowland and Fernando Ocampo Sr. as directors. Some of the or ganization’sundertakingswere the draftingofits Constitutionsand By-Laws, the“Rulesof Charges and Professional Fees,”and the Canon of Ethicsof the Society. Apartfrom the trainingreceivedfrom an academic setting, anotherformoftutelage was the master-apprenticesystem thatexistedwithinthe of ficeof the Bureau of Public Works. As the BPW was basicallytasked to supervisethe design and constructionofpublic structuresand landscapesintheislands, itoperated likean architecturalfirm.

Odom, teaming with Fred Patstone, a for mer Manila City Engineer, and George Fenhagen, Consulting Architect, completed the imposing Masonic Temple in 1913. Odom got carriedaway with the building fever. Considered as the fatherof commercial concreteedificesin Manila, he embarked on a buildingspreeon the streetsof Escoltaand Dasmarifias, which resultedinthe Burke Building, Yangco-Rosenstock Building, La Estrelladel Norte Jewelryand Auto Palace, and the four Gibbs Buildings.

In 1906, William Parsonsrecommended the constructionofarcades oversidewalks in certainbusiness streetsfor protection against sun and rain and for the convenienceofwholesaleand retaildealersand the generalpublic(Reportofthe Philippine Commission 1906, 366).

For this distinction, Arellanowas posthumously awarded the Centennial Honor for the Artsby the Cultural Centerof the Philippinesin 1999. Juan Arellano (1888-1960) was born in Tondo, Manila. He was the son of Bartola de Guzman and master builder Luis C. Arellano. With hisfather’ssudden death when he was only thirteen, he quitstudying at the Ateneo to work at the Bureau of Lands where he eventuallybecame a draftsman. During that period, he studied painting under Lorenzo Guerrero afterofficehours. When he was eighteen, Arellanoran away and traveledto the United Statesto study architecture. There, he was able to findwork, firstas one of the numerous Filipinoswho were “displayed”at the Jamestown Exposition, and, later, as a photograph coloristin acommercial museum in Philadelphia. Propitiously, a coupletook in terestinhim and decidedtosponsor hiseducationatthe Philadelphia Academy of Art. In 1906, he enrolledat the Architectural School of the Drexel Institutein Philadelphia. Aftergraduation, he and histwo American friendswent on a tour of Europe. A year later, he returned to the United States, finisheda postgraduatecourseinarchitectureatthe Universityof Pennsylvania, and at tended the Beaux Arts School in New York, furtherenhancing the in fluenceof the Paris Ecolede Beaux Artstraditionon hisstylisticslant. Arellanoreturnedto the Philippinesto become one of Manila’smost important architects. With hisequallyesteemed brother, Arcadio Arellano, he worked on such projectsasthe Gota de Leche Buildingand the old Casino Espafiol. Afterward, he was employed at the Bureau of Public Works, risingfrom the ranks as an assistant, supervising, and, finally, consultingarchitect.

Arellano he steeredthedevelopmentof Philippinearchitecture, from itsneoclassicphase to itsprotomodern (artdeco and streamlinemoderne) and nativistphases. Arellano was also a painter, an aquarellistof note. His 1913 work Forestis considered as one of the firstimpressionistpaintingsdone bya Filipinoartist. Some arthistoriansbelievethathe was in strumentalinconditioningtheclimate for modernism to flourishinthecountry. Arellano’svirtuosoarticulationof neoclassicismassumed in ternationalstature, receivingworld acclaim ina competition heldin New York where he submitted a designforthe Bank of the Philippine Islands. Through hisfamous works, such as the Legislative Building(now the National Museum), the Jones Bridge, and the IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 309 Manila Post Office, hisespousal of monumental neoclassicisminthe Philippine architecturalscenography imbued the American form of government and civic culturewith presence and made unerringlypalpable itsimperialaspirationin ferroconcrete. To some extentthen, Pax Americana in the Pacifictranslatedintoa globalurbanism of a neoclassicalstandardand a civilizationaldynamic predicated on the marmoreal tradition of the ages. Thissaid, itmust at once be pointedout that Arellanointerpretedand appropnated the grammar of Beaux Arts in the contextof the tropicalmilieu, successfully conversingacrosstwo architecturalidioms in structuresthat hintat hybridity. Again, as with his predecessors, thisaestheticchoice was in cadence with Burnham’s urban directives, the spatiallogicinwhich the imperialisttimedwelled.

Artdeco was a synthetic form of stylizationmediating between the traditionaland the avant-garde.

Nativist iconography isexpressedintelltale Philippinedetails, such as bamboo banister railings, carved banana and mango reliefs, and batikmosaic patterns. Turning away from the classicists, decorativeindulgences, Arellanocollaborated, in 1934, with otherarchitectsofthe Bureau of Public Works and came up with the archetypalstreamlineddeco, the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Itsaerodynamic curves suggestedspeed, efficiency, and, most of all, modernity. Thisstructure, considered a precursorof the Modern Internationalstyle, was a horizontal, rectangular container, with aspects in timating mass production: rounded corners or semicircularbays; mechanically smooth buildingskin; punctured porthole windows; tubularsteelrailings; and projecting, thinroofslab. Arellano’sromanticnativiststancewas exemplifiedby hisproposalsforgovernment buildingsin Banaue, Ifugao, and in Glan, Cotabato.

The Second-Generation Architects and the Shift to Art Deco The so-calledsecond-generationarchitects, such as Andres Luna de San Pedro, Pablo Antonio, Fernando Ocampo, and Juan F. Nakpil, flourishedamidst the struggleforpoliticalindependence from America. Liketheirpredecessors, they were trainedin American universitiesand had traveledextensivelyto Europe, exposingthemselvesto a new stylethatquicklyswept the Western hemisphere— the Art Deco. Armed with the new aestheticfrom Euro-America, the yreturnedto the Philippines to challengethe dominance of the neoclassicstyleinthe localpractice. These architectscould be seen as culturalagents in the shifttoward the new, stylistic phenomenon. With in novativeideasand novelways of utilizingornaments, they designed structuresthat departed from the Beaux Artsidiom, and propagated among the publicthe mantra of art deco. Andres Luna de San Pedro, the most seniorof the group and the most European in or ientation, returnedto the Philippinesin 1920. Fernando Ocampo graduated from the Universityof Pennsylvaniain 1921, but was sentto Rome as a student fellow. Juan Nakpil received his Master’s degree at Harvard in 1926, and supplemented hisknowledge by at tendingthe Ecoledes Beaux Artsforone summer. Pablo Antonio returned, in 1930, from the Universityof London, aftercompleting the five-yeararchitecturalcourse ina span of three years. @ L IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 315 Andres Luna de San Pedro and Fernando Ocampo in itiallyutilizedthe revivalist styles, but by, 1930, they had produced some of the most modern buildingsin Manila. Juan Nakpiland Pablo Antonio, on the otherhand, were vanguards of art deco modernism from the veryoutsetoftheir designpractice. As pioneersinmodern designinthecountry, the fourarchitectswere notablefor the ircontributionsthat representeda new directionin Philippinearchitecture. Luna de San Pedro in troduced new architecturalforms in the Philippinesby in corporatingmodern and exoticdesignmotifsthrough the grammar of art deco. Likewise, Ocampo designedbuildingswithstraightforwardsimplicity, synthesizing traditionaldesignswith artdeco or naments typifyingthe moderne styleof the period. Nakpilworked largelyinthe artdeco style, combining stylizedfloraand angularforms. Nakpil’sprewararchitecturewas marked by the presenceof rounded corners, round columns, plainsurfaces, continuoushonzontalwallsand windows, and minimal or namentation. These structureswere archetypalof an artdeco strainknown asstreamlinedmoderne. Some of Nakpil’sworks were protomodern, which seemed to anticipatetheemergenceofthe International Styleofmodernism in the postwaryears. Insimilartrailblazingconceptsinarchitecture, Antonio veered away from the traditionalistand academic stylestoembrace moderne streamlining with hisuseofbold, cleanlines, straightforwardsurfaces, and spare, rectangular masses. From thisgeneration, Juan Nakpil and Pablo Antonio were to emerge as the country’s National Artistsfor Architecture, the highesthonorgivenby the Philippine government to artists. ANDRES LUNA DE SAN PEDRO (1887-1952) The son of the great Filipinopainter Juan Luna and himself a highly-acclaimedpainter, Andres Luna de San Pedro served as an architectof the Cityof Manila from 1920 to 1924. He laterwent in to privatepracticeand trained Filipinoarchitects who worked under him. Although schooled in the academic and revivalist Beaux Arts style, he was one of the pioneers of modern design in the Philippines. His works in the revivaliststyleinclude the Legarda Elementary School and the Rafael Fernandez House, which was used by President Corazon Aquino as her of ficialresidenceduring her term. Works in the artdeco and modem styles in clude the Perez-Samanillo Building and the Crystal Arcade, which was regarded as his masterpiece and considered as Manila’s most modern building before World War II. The neocastilian Perkin’s House, as ment ioned in pre- World War Ilpublications, was saidto be the most modern in the countrywhen itwas builtand was awarded firstprizein the 1925 House Beautiful Contest. Major Works: Alfonso Zobel House, Basa Residence, Crystal Arcade (1931), Evangelista Residence, Fernandez-Martinez House, Insular Life Building, Plaza Cervantes(1930), Jacobo Zobel House, Legarda Elementary School (1922), Perez-Samanillo Building (1930), Perkin’s House, Rafael Fernandez House, Regina Building(1926), San Vicente de Paul Chapel (now Church), St. Cecilia’s Hallof St. Scholastica’s College, Sy Cong Bieng Mausoleum. 316 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO JUAN FELIPE DE JESUS NAKPIL (1899-1986) Juan Nakpil startedas an assistantarchitectat the Bureau of Public Works in 1926. He then became a partnerin the firm of architect Andres Luna de San Pedro and structuralengineer Jose G. Cortes in 1928 and with them designedthe Perez- Samanillo Buildingin Escolta. From 1928 to 1931, he was a designer of Puyat and Sons where he in troduced art deco motifs into the furniture in dustry. In 1930, he won the second pnze in the Bonifacio Monument Competition. He taught at the Mapua Instituteof Technology (MIT) from 1927 to 1931 and at the Universityof Santo Tomas (UST) from 1931 to 1938. Nakpil took part in various in itiativesto upgrade buildingstandards and improve the condition of architects. He designedmore than 200 buildings, in cludingoffice buildings, movie houses, schoolbuildings, churches, and residences. The range of hisstyleisrepresentedinthe neobaroque Quiapo Church; the artdeco Nakpil-Bautista Pylon; and the Manila Jockey Club done in the International style.

FERNANDO HIZON OCAMPO (1897-1984) Fernando Ocampo began working for the architecturedivisionof the Bureau of Public Works in 1923 and was named assistant architect in 1926. In 1928, he startedhisown privatepractice and for med a partnershipwith Tomas Arguelles. He latercofounded the UST School of Fine Arts and Architecture, which was establishedin 1930. From 1929 to 1930, Ocampo was a member of the Board of Examiners for Architects and, in 1933, was among the founders of the Philippine Architects’Society, laterrenamed the Philippine Instituteof Architects. Although presentlybetter known for having designed the Manila Cathedral, Ocampo was, in fact, one of the pioneers of modern architecture in the Philippines, a contemporary of Andres Luna de San Pedro and Juan Nakpil.

IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 317 PABLO SEBERO ANTONIO (1902-1975) _ After becoming a registeredarchitectin 1932, Pablo Antonio was appointed as the architectof variousinstitutionsand corporations, such as the Philippine National Bank, Manila Railroad Company, and the Far Eastern University(FEU) where he designed severalof itsbuildings. Aside from school and government buildings, Antonio also designed the at ersand apartments. Among hisworks, he considersthe Manila Polo Club as one of his best. His buildingswere characterized by cleanlines, plainsurfaces, and bold rectangular masses—a strikingdigressionfrom the traditionalist and academic style prevalent at the time. Moreover, hisworks have been imparted with a distinctiveform and character, as he avoids anything that might be seen as a trademark. Antonio also became presidentof the Philippine Instituteof Architects. Major Works: Boulevard Alhambra (now Bel-Air Apartments), Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building, FEU Administration and Science Buildings, FEU Building, Galaxy Theatre, Ideal Theater (1933), Manila Polo Club (on Roxas Boulevard), Ramon Roces Publications Building, White Cross Preventorium. The Aesthetics of Art Deco Sleek, exotic, and modern—these were the hallmarksof Art Deco, an in ternational stylethatoriginatedin Europe and in fluencednearlyeveryfacetof artand design in the firsthalfof the twentiethcentury. The word artdeco was a recentterm coinedonlyin 1966 to describetheaestheticand stylisticsystem emanating from the 1925 Exposition Internationaledes Arts Decoratifset Industriels Modernes, held in Paris. The Parisworld fairshowcased more than a hundred pavilions representingtwenty European, African, and Asian nationswiththeaim to catalyze a widerapplicationofdecorative artsinlightoftechnologyand mass production. The group of artifactsfrom the expositionwas seen as a progressivedeparture from previousstyles, thus, the term modern or modernistic to describethe antihistoricalstandpoint of art deco aestheticsand the search for “new” approaches to the decorativearts.

Motifs of Art Deco Inhergerminalbook The World of Art Deco, author Bevis Hillier(1971) provided a listof recurringmotifs in artdeco imagery. One such motif was the frozen fountain, which symbolizedvitality, life, and dynamism. Initsdifferentmutations, the fountain motif would of tentimesbe the centralicon in a composition or repeatedina pattern. Forskyscraperdesigners, the frozenfountainwas a conscious designmetaphor. Claude Bragdon, in his 1932 book, The Frozen Fountain, said, “Intheskyscraper, both for structuraltruthand symbolicsignificance, the reshould be upward sweeping linesto dramatizetheengineeringfactofverticalcontinuity and the poeticfancyof an ascendingforceinresistanceto gravity—afountain.” 320 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 5-144 The motifs of art deco may in clude: geometric and abstractdesigns, stylizedforms found in nature, natural and man-made energy, fountains and gushing water, stylized human and zoomorphic figures, and exotic and or ientalist motifs. 5-145 Floralcornucopia designs found above the front balcony of the Emralino Mansion, built 1927, in Sariaya, Quezon 5.146 A seriesof medallions lavishedwith reliefsof fruits, flowers, and leavessuggesting profuse tropicalgardens and for ests at the Metropolitan Theater “ ‘L _ 5-147 Ornamental panels at the Metropolitan Theater.

IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 321 ay Uh a Ue 5-149 The liberalapplicationof stylizedand geometricizedflora gave art deco structures a playfulaura, charm, and grace that contrasted with the severityof the architectural proportions of neocastilian residencesof the 1930 s, such as this house in Sariaya, Quezon (oppositepage). 5-150 Boomerang-likechevrons layeredwith spiralsand lancet archesfound on the lamp of the Perez-Samanillo Building in Escolta 5-151 The straightforward arrangements of basic geometric shapes—squares, circles, and triangles—of the decorative screen of the Quezon Bridgein Manila closely resembledthegeometricmotifs of Frank Lloyd Wright. Another persistent pattern was the sun ray or sunburst motif. Sunburst patterns were expressed eitheron metalwork, terra-cotta, or concrete reliefwork as architecturaldetailsto again evoke the notionofvitality. The provenance of such solardesigncould be tracedto the sun worship ntualsofancientcultures, such as in Egypt and Peru. Other pervailingthemes in the artdeco styleincludedfloraland botanicalmotifs, animal forms, celestialmotifs, mythologicalcharacters, and anthropomorphic figures. Stylizationofflowers, animals, and evenhuman figuresgravitatedtowards fragmentation, simplification, and cubisticgeometry. Zigzagmoderne focusedon angularizingrounded cornersand figures; whilestreamlinedmoderne rounded off angularcornersand sharp edges. In Manila, the period between the 1920 s and 1930 s brought in two building typologies—the movie house and the apartment block. Both were mostlybuiltin the artdeco style. The artdeco apartmentswere builtin Ermitaand Malate, both enclavesofexpatriatesand the localupper class. By the 1930 s, the seareaswere gettingcrowded, so the solutionwas to expand vertically. About a dozen of these apartments arestillextant.

Insuch in stances, the use of art deco appliquéscould be seen as a convenientway to redressexistingbuildingtypologyforamore fashionable, modern, and updated look. The extantresidenceof Tomas Mapua, along Taft Avenue in Pasay, stands as a proud testamentto Mapua’s virtuosityinthe Philippineartdeco stylereflectedin itsresidentialarchitectureand in teriordesignof the 1930 s. The house combined neoclassicand artdeco aesthetics, asevidentinitsflamboyantarchitecturaldetails and elements—wood and plasterbas-reliefsofstylizedfoliageand floraldesigns, geometric irongrillworks, stylizedcarvingand in lays, and hand-rendered faux veneers. Another manifestationof Classical Deco was Stripped Classicism, as epitomized by the lloilo Municipal Hall (1930 s), Bulacan Provincial Capitol (1930), and Tayabas Provincial Capitol(1933), allattributedto Juan Arellano, and the Cebu Provincial Capitol (1937) by Antonio Toledo. From a distance, the overall symmetrical composition would seem to in dicatea neoclassicpedigree, an architecturalimage setby William Parsonsforcapitolcomplexesinthe Philippines, but, upon closerinspection, the simplifiedcolumns, pediment, and friezesreveal artdeco aesthetics. The Cebu Provincial Capitolrepresentedthe in teractionof classicallybalanced masses with emphasis on symmetry and horizontalityas demonstrated by itsinward-curvingfacade thatsupported a dome raisedon an octagonalbase, which tendsto dissimulatetheflatartdeco or naments.

Moreover, the economic recessionof the 1930 sdiscouraged the applicationofostentatiousdecorativeelements in buildingsinfavorofcost- effective, straightforward, and austerestructures, making artdecoa suitablepretext for strippingaway the classicalfeaturesor replacingthem with a more stylized breed of or nament. Another explanationmight leadto the factthatartdeco was a mediatingstylein the shiftfrom Beaux Artsto Modernism. Art deco structuresadapted classical references, such asthestrongsymmetry in the massing, planning, and composition of structures, and the in corporationofclassicaldetails(suchas columns, friezes, and acroteria)in decorativeelementsand motifsinstylizedrenditions. Meanwhile, the columns on porticoshad simplifiedincarnationsin the form of flattened flutingson the surfacesbut stillmaintained the familiaraura of a colonnaded, neoclassicbuilding—anarchitecturalimage which the publicwere well-acquainted with and could easilyrelateto.

Zigzag Moderne, as itflourishedbeforethe 1929 Great Depressioninthe United States, leaned to warda flashier, more opulent, luxurious, and generous decorativeexpression.

The useofgeometricpatternswas prominentincommercialstructuresthataspired to be modern and progressive, yetsuch structureswere not entirelyapatheticto civicand in stitutionalbuildingsmaneuvered in the classicalvocabulary. The Geronimo Reyes Building(1930) in Plaza Cervantes, Binondo, designedby Juan Nakpil, was predominantlydecoratedwitha combination of chevrons, octagons, rectangularblocks, recedingstepped bands, and othergeometricpermutations on the parapet, colonnade, and windows.

Includedinthe arrayofthe “zigzag”idiom was the pylon motifthatappeared in severalcommercialand in stitutionalstructures. The Eucharistic Monument (1937), designedby Juan Nakpilasa centerpieceforthe International Eucharistic Congress of 1937, was a tall, slenderstructurecomposed of threecolumns to pped by a circularbeam and a cupola. The soaringcolumns of the pylon were decorated with stylizedhuman figuresina gestureofprayer thatservedascapitals. Thiswas akinto his Bautista-Nakpil Pylonatthe North Cemetery in Manila, builta decade earlier. The funerarypylon, a tributetothe Bautistaand Nakpilfamilies, employed the maiden figuresnearthetopofthe structure.

The steppedtowerswere similarlymanifestedon the piersofthe Quezon Bridge, Perez- Samanillo Building, the Universityof Santo Tomas Main Seminary, the Capitol Theater, and the prewar Saint Anthony Parish Church (in Singalong, Manila). Thissenseofverticalityhad been apparent at the 1925 International Expositionin Parisaswellas in the 1933 Art Deco Expositionin Chicago and the 1939 World’s Fairin New York. The ideaofverticalityembodied in the sepylonswas the same notion of verticalitythat skyscrapersexpressed.

The steppedtowerswere similarlymanifestedon the piersofthe Quezon Bridge, Perez- Samanillo Building, the Universityof Santo Tomas Main Seminary, the Capitol Theater, and the prewar Saint Anthony Parish Church (in Singalong, Manila). Thissenseofverticalityhad been apparent at the 1925 International Expositionin Parisaswellas in the 1933 Art Deco Expositionin Chicago and the 1939 World’s Fairin New York. The ideaofverticalityembodied in the sepylonswas the same notion of verticalitythat skyscrapersexpressed.

The dense treatment of low-reliefsculptures, the geometricscrolls, and the stepped forms adorning many of these Philippineart deco structureswere drawn from the stockof artdeco motifspopularizedduring the 1925 Expositionor the apogee of Le Style Moderne. Edgar Brandt’sfive-panel screenentitled“Oasis,”exhibitedat the Parisfair, launched severalimitations across Europe and the United States.

Several imitations were launched across Euro-America and even the Philippines. 5.168 Zigzag Moderne aestheticsof Bauan Municipal Buildingin Batangas buildings as the Metropolitan Theater and the Santos House were undeniably descendants of Edgar Brandt’swrought ironworks thatfeaturedwater spouts and were linkedto such motifs as those in Rene Lalique’s Parfumerie Francaisepavilion at the Paris Exhibition. Some of the patterns and motifs might not be necessarily new or radical, sincea lot of the motifs were also derived, in one form or another, from classical Greco-Roman sources, but the difference was more in the geometricized treatment. French or namentations were presentinthe earlyversionsof Filipinoartdeco. Among the desiredmotifswere the pylons(asinthe Bautista-Nakpil Pylonatthe North Cemetery in Manila), frozenfountains(found at the Metropolitan Theater, Santos House in Malolos), sunburst motifs (Santos House in Malolos), and exoticized maidens (Metropolitan Theater, Bellevue Theater) as well as geometricizedflowersand foliagepatterns(Mapua House, Metropolitan Theater).

A prevailingsenseofexoticism and primitivismforms the underlyingtheme of motifs from ancientcultures, such as Assyrian/Babylonian, Egyptian, and Mayan/Aztec. Easilyidentifiedwith the Zigzag Moderne strainofart deco, the stepped massing from the Assyrianand Mayan zigguratsand steppedpyramidsappeared consistently in several Philippineartdeco structures. The Capitol Theater (1935) and the Metropolitan Theater (1931) in Manila, the Jaro Municipal Building(1934, now the Jaro Police Station)in lloilo, Bauan Municipal Building(1930) in Batangas, and the Sariaya Municipal Building(1930 s) in Quezon are decidedlyzigzag because of the stepped silhouettesthatpredominate the volumetricmassing of the facades.

A kind of abstractionwas thus achievedthrough the simplificationofform. Occupying the for efrontofthe artdeco styleinthe Philippineswas Juan Arellano’s Metropolitan Theater (1931) in Plaza Lawton which marked hisdeviationfrom his Beaux Artslineage. Forthisproject, Arellanowas sentto the United Statesto study under the tutelageof Thomas Lamb of Shreve and Lamb, then one of America’sleadingexpertsintheaterdesign. Ina styleobservedby A. V. H. Hartendorp as“modern expressionistic,”Arellanotook in spirationfrom the phrase“On Wings of Song” to design a rectangular-shapedauditorium bounded on each sideby pavilions. Stylizedfrom Philippinevegetationand wildlife, the motifswere executed with the assistanceof Arellano’selderbrother, Arcadio, and Isabelo Tampingco, the leadingdecorativesculptorofthe day. The facadeof the Metropolitancould be likenedto a stagewhose focalpointwas a framed, proscenium-likecentralwindow of stained glassthatcorresponded in scaleand shape to the the aterproscenium in side.

Adaptinga scientificdefinition, streamlinesare definedas “lines whose localdirectioncorrespondswithlocalflowspeed.”Indesign, streamlining means the “aestheticof minimized drag,”which means the achievement of an aerodynamic form with the leastwind resistance. The architecturalvocabularyof the streamlinedmoderne was relativelylimitedto a particularsetofvisuallexicon. Semicircularbaysattachedto rectangles, rounded corners, flatroofs, cantilevered ledges, extended parapets, and narrow horizontalbands were mainstaysofthis idiom. New materials, such as Vitrolite, Formica, Lucite, Carraraglass, porcelained enamel, metal alloys(suchas nickel, aluminum, chrome), stucco, plywood, and variousformsofveneeringwere utilizedextensively. Sheathingand surfacecladding were more importantthan showing the actualstructure. Thus, unsightlybuilding materials, such as pipes, conduits, structuralframes, and allthe other“messy” buildingcomponents were hiddenfrom viewby coveringthem with sleeksurfaces. The main characteristicsofstreamlineddeco were cleanlinesachievedby having verythin concrete slab protrusionswith emphasis on the horizontalityof the massing, sunbreaksor brisesoleiloverwindows, mechanicallysmooth wallsurfaces implyingmass production, and, sometimes, by usingflatroofs, speed stripes, curved edges, rounded corners, and the prolificapplicationofglassand metal. Alsofound in thisvariationwere maritime motifs, such as portholewindows and ship-in spiredtubularrailingsofthin, horizontalmetal stripesor bands. Included in thiscategoryaresuch examples asthe Far Eastern University Building(1935) in Manila, designedby Pablo Antonio, which exhibitedrounded cornersand smooth surfaces, and Arellano’s Rizal Memorial Stadium (1936), with itsoceanliner imagery. Initsarchetypalform, the streamlinedmoderne buildingwas a honzontal, rectangularcontainerwith rounded cornersor semicircularbays and smooth buildingskinand to pped by a parapeted or projectingthinslabroof.

Buildingsresemblingboatsand ocean linersalsobecame popularinthe Philippines. Fernando Ocampo’s renderingof maritime buildingiconography resultedinthe Lopez House (1936).

As the characteristicsof these two stylesoverlapand lacka clear-cutdelineationto separatethem, there Isdifficultyindistinguishingstreamlineddeco from the early moderniststructures. Consider, for in stance, the Manila Jockey Club designed by Juan Nakpilin 1936. The glass-enclosedmain staircaseof the clubwas similarin form to the staircasesof the factorydesigned by Walter Gropius for the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Atfirstglance, the machine aestheticembodied in the use of highlyindustrializedmaterials, such as glassand metal, was expressiveof the functionalqualitiesofmodernism. However, on closerinspection, some partsof the buildingwere, in fact, highlydecorative. The horizontalbands at the balconies, the stripesatthelightingrod, and the rounded edgeswere not necessarilya response to pure function; ratherthey were part of an aestheticchampioned by the burgeoningstreamlinedmethod. The MERALCO Building (1936)at San Marcelino, Manila, builtinthe late 1930 s, belonged to thiscategory. A highlyasymmetrical composition was achievedby a to wer on one sideand a long horizontalmass on the other. The buildinghad a rounded corneratitsbase, juxtaposedwithwindow projectionsrunning along the lengthof the buildingon the second level. A low- reliefsculptureatthe leftsideof the structureindicatesitsalliancewith artdeco ratherthan the International Style. The Crystal Arcade (1932) was the for erunnerof ourmodern-day shopping mall architecture. The buildingearned distinctionas the most celebratedbuildingof the earlytwentiethcenturybeforeitsannihilationinthe lastdays of the Pacific War. Itsname was derivedfrom Joseph Paxton’s London Crystal Palace(1851), as both buildingsmade an abundant useofglass as a major buildingcomponent. Asidefrom beingan excellentspecimenofstreamlining, itwas the firstcommercial edificeto in troducea concoursewalkway leadingto the glass-walledshops on the firstlevel. Designed and partlyowned by Andres Luna de San Pedro, the or iginal plan proposed a seven-storeybuildingwith a ten-storeycentraltower but was partiallycompleted as a three-storeymall.

In 1936, the buildingwas soldto L. R. Nelson for 1.5 millionpesos. The buildingwas destroyedbeyond repair duringthe lastdays of the Second World War. The streamlined Rizal Memorial Stadium (1934) was a resultof a design collaborationamong a team of architectsof the Bureau of Public Works, headed by Juan Arellano.

State Theater Ticketsto Deco Fantasy The technology of the cinematograph in the earlytwentiethcenturyspawned a new breed of architecture, a new building type that combined the traditionalplanning scheme derived from classic the ater design with compellingdoses of fantasyplayed out in the realm of darkness—a space litonly by a streak of light projectedonto a fourthwall. The design of cinema palacesreacheditspinnaclebetween the 1920 s and 1940 s, a periodwhen watching movies establisheditselfasthe Filipinonational pastime. For a mere priceof a ticket, one can engage in an exotictrance facilitatedby the materialityof art deco architectureand the potentialmyth createdby Hollywood’s dream factory. The or iginof cinema houses as a buildingform can be traced through the firstexhibitionof film in the Philippines. Such a cinematic encounter was made possible by the construction of the firstelectricpower plant in the country in 1895.

More importantly, the entire experienceinsidethe cinema house was framed in such a way that the experiencewas potentlysuffusedwith a sense of “suspension of disbelief.”With thistechnique, the audience was conditioned to be more receptiveand in terested, as they were cut off from the realitiesoftheirmundane existenceoutsidethecinema premisesand transported into a richand self-containedauditorium where the irminds were emancipated from the irusual preoccupations and freedfrom the ircustomary lives. Typologically, Philippinemovie housescould be likenedto thatof a box witha decorated facade, Exteriorsof cinema buildingsresortedto architecturalgimmickry and fantastic IMPERIAL IMAGININGS 349 or namentation, but only at the frontfacade. These frontalindulgenceswere designed to lureaudiences in sidea contrastinglydark and sparselyornamented main viewing hall. Theater owners realizedthat the cuttingedge design of architecturesold tickets and gave the the ater a unique identity. The Philippinesinehan had to assume the diverseschema of art deco whimsicalityin itsrichlyarticulatedfacade, a far detour from the early Filipinomovie house of plain wooden or reinforcedconcrete with a restrainedneoclassicfestoonedfacade in trompe l’oeil. The designof artdeco cinemas gave film audiences a new experiencebeyond the mere visualappeal of the facade appliqué, The circulationof the at ergoerswas or chestratedin a sequence of spaces, a progressionthat approximated the basicstructureof a narrativefilm—exposition, rise of conflict, resolution, climax, and dénouement. Upon enteringa the ater, a moviegoer would pass through a seriesof spaces: the entrance vestibule, foyer, lobby, lounge, upper levelpromenade, and waitingroom, allof which were meant to providecomfort and escape from reallife. Among these spaces, the lobby was considered the most monumental event to stimulatethe imagination of the crowd. Thus, the lobby was embellishedwith stainedglass, reliefsculptures, or nate fountains, and statuary. Within the premisesof the cinema space, slow but effectivemeans of channelingthe great American Dream were being played out. Movie the at ers, to gether with the Hollywood cinema in dustry, would playan in dispensablepart in the Americanization _ofthe Filipino. When monumental publicbuildingsof the neoclassiclineagerosein the architecturallandscape to projectan image of American benevolence and civilizing presence, so did motion picturepalacesthat tapped exoticarcheologicalsourcesfor the irthemes and motifs, but on a lessgrand scale. Not to be outdone, the the ater's modest sizewas countervailedby itspolychromaticfacade that contrastedwith the black-and-whitemovies and the comucopia of stylizeddecorativeelementsemanating from a myriad of Orientalistinfluences that in terpret Indo-Islamic, Chinese, Mesopotamian, and South Seas familiarculturalicons, or even a Hollywood filmset. The art deco craze coincided with the nse of the cinema house as a democratized architecturalspace where a largenumber of people from allsocialstrata, at a given time, were accorded the same sorceryframed by a common architecturalexperience. art deco as an aestheticmovement was valorizedfor itsmass reproducibility, so was cinema’s engagement with mass reception. The art deco stylewas keenly received through the architectureof movie houses and sparked the popular imagination in the in terwar architecturalmilieu. The omateness of artdeco combined with judiciousinterpretationof Philippinemotifs was expressed in the Juan Arellano’s Metropolitan Theater (1931), where Filipinized forms were found in the details, such as Philippinefloralmotifs, bamboo banister railings, carved banana and mango ceilingreliefs, South Sea masks, and Batikmosaic patterns. In preparationfor the project, architect Arellanowent to the United States to study with Thomas W. Lamb, then one of the for emost expertsin the at erdesign. Incidentally, the proportionsof the facade, the huge square concreteframe that played host to a centralwindow of stainedglass, and the two South Sea masks in reliefwere elements derivativeof Shreeve and Lamb’s design for the Ziegfeld Theater in the US. However, a low, segmented arch witha seriesof finialsat the summit of the facade distinguished Arellano’sdesignfrom the latter. Sponged paintbrought out the textural qualitiesof the exteriorwalls.

Other cinemas which Juan Nakpil designed were the State Theater (1935) and Avenue Theater (1939). State Theater followed the art deco contoured silhouette highlighted by a decorative parapet with a central medallion and art deco stylizationof a carabao head. State and Avenue were rebuiltin 1946. Bellevue Theater (1931), a small the ater in Paco, Manila, adopted Philippine Islamic imagery as itsart deco theme (perhaps borrowing in spirationfrom the tradition of moro-moro the at rical scenography or from the setdesignof LVN Studio’s Arabesque swashbucklingmovies). The the ater was symmetrical, with a centralplane of elaborateconcretepierced work dominating the building’s composition and flanked by two rectangularvolumes to pped with domes on both sides. At ground level, the cinema opened to a small foyerthat led to a pseudo-grand staircase, which was guarded on both sides by sculptures of harem maidens. At streetlevel, two emergency doors emphasized the facade with pointed arches on opposite sides. In the 1930 s, the design of cinemas gave way to the “smooth curvesand the aura of precisionand exactitudesof the streamlinedstyle, with itssignificationof the power of machinery.”Designersresponded to the economic constraintsof the time by eliminating from the structurethe abundance of applied or nament in favor of a more austere variant of art deco known as “streamlined moderne.” Inspired in part by great transatlanticocean liners, the new stylefeatured aerodynamic curves, smooth wall surfaces, and steelrailings, and was of ten marked by the signaturetrioof horizontal speed stripesthat were meant to suggest motion. The streamlined moderne in the Philippineswas considered the precursor of the International Style. Itsarchitecturaltranslationwas based on horizontallyoriented buildingswith aerodynamic curves, flatroofs, glassblocks, banded windows, tubular steelrailings, speed stripes, and mechanicallysmooth wall surfacesand in teriorsthat were far lesssumptuous. Itparalleledthe imagery used in airplanes, ocean liners, locomotives, automobiles, and household appliancesby in dustrialdesigners. The archetypalstreamlinedbuildingwas simply a horizontal rectangular container with rounded corners or semicircularbays, smooth buildingskin, punctured porthole windows, and surmounted by a parapetedor projecting thin slab roof. Pablo Antonio’s Ideal Theater (1933) and Luis Ma. Araneta’s Times Theater (1941) exemplifiedthe adaptationof the streamlinedmoderme. Pablo Antonio’s firstarchitecturalwork for cinema was the Ideal Theater (1933), or iginallybuiltof wood in 1908, on Rizal Avenue. The Ideal Theater was a statement in streamlined art deco aesthetics. The entrance to the the ater was flanked by two massive pillars between vertical bands. During the Japanese occupation, Ideal was made into an exclusive the ater for Japanese movies. IMPERIAL IMAGININGS Bellevie Theater Ideal Theater 351 The Lyric Theater (1935) in Escolta was Antonio’s deviationfrom artdeco’smachine aesthetics, Here, he abandoned streamliningin favorof an exotic Middle Easterntheme.

As a firststep, in 1935, the Philippine Commonwealth was establishedas a transitiongovernment, autonomous in domestic affairs, with Manuel Quezon swom inas itsfirstpresident. The Philippine economy continuedto prosper, at tributedtoa sizablefund builtfrom taxescollected from the Philippinecoconut in dustrythatthe US government turned over to the Quezon administration. The funds were used for in frastructureand other development projects. The Philippines’traditionalexport commodities—abaca, coconut and coconut oil, sugar, and timber—were also doing very well as the breakout of the war in Europe in 1939 in creasedthe demand for these products, especiallycoconut oiland timber. In 1937, Manila was no longerjusta bigtown as itlaidclaim to the statusof a world citywhen ithosted the International Eucharistic Congress. To projecta modern image of asoon-to-beindependentnationstate, Juan Nakpil, the architect of the in ternationalevent, employed the grammar of art deco in the designof the Euchanstic Monument and itsancillarystructures. The thirty-meterhighmonument, builton the Luneta grounds, housed an altarand was supported by threecarved columns symbolicof Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Philippineidentity, achieved through the use of in digenous materials, was alsoshowcased in the design of Processional Arches and Pilgrim Arches, which combined bamboo and salakot designs. As Manila rapidlygrew in toa hub of in ternationaltradeand commerce, the city was for cedto expand to accommodate itsever-in creasingpopulation.

President Quezon consideredtransferringthecapitalfrom Manila to a new and improved sitewith sufficientcontiguouslanddirectlyaccessibleto Manila.

Fresh from the success of his design of the Bonifacio Monument, Guillermo Tolentino was chosen to allegoricallyinterpretthe ideals of the new Commonwealth. In due time, Tolentino presented the maquette of the arch to the President and the National Assembly for their approval. An act was passed that authorized the construction of the arch in Manila. The design, havinga dimension of 27 m tallx 22 m wide x 8 m deep, featureda flatarch with streamlinededges typicalof art deco. Supporting the arch on both sideswere classicallyproportioned bodies in a heroicgestureof carryingthe massive structureto allude to the spiritof bayanihan in nation-building.

Quezon’s dream of a blissful“Barrio Obrero”(Laborer’s Village)was to become the nucleusofthe city.

Barrio Obrero: Communities for the Working Class The demand for housing in the 1920 s createda constructionboom of tenement houses and apartments such as “acessorias”or “posesiones”for lease. Privately owned estateswere in the hands of a few wealthyfamiliesand religiousorders. The grievancesand conflictsover land were in creasinglyfeltinthe urban slums, along with the deplorablehousing conditionsofthe laboringclass. The period’s laboragitationresultedintheestablishmentofbarrios obreroor laborer’svillages. In 1915, labor leader Isabelode los Reyes launched the veryfirstworking-class district. The Barrio Obrero scheme became a stapleitem in the listof labor demands, which the colonialadministratorsof the Cityof Manila addressedinthe 1920 s. The Barrio Obrero aimed to promote the welfareof the laboringclassand to freethe poor laborersfrom rapaciousand racketeeringlandlords.

To spare the cityfrom damage from the advancing Japanese Imperial Army, General Douglas Mac Arthur declared Manila an “open city”on December 27, 1941. Inhiscommuniqué, he explained: In or der to spare the Metropolitan area from ravages of at tack, eitherby airorground, Manila isherebydeclaredan open citywithout the characteristicsof a militaryobjective.

Citizens are requestedto maintain obedience to constitutedauthoritiesand continue the normal processesof business(GHQ, USAFFE 1941). The citizensof Manila were caught in a stateof shock as they realizedthat the Americans had abandoned the cityto the Japanese. Yet, Manila’sopen citystatus did not stop the in vadersfrom assaultingthe defenselesscityand the firstbombs were dropped the followingday. Fivewaves of bombers in for mations of eight to nine aircraftflew leisurelyover Manila’s waterfront.

As earlyas February 11, 1942, the educationaland culturalprogram of Japan for occupied Philippineswas delineatedin Order No. 2 of the militaryadministration, which setthefollowingguidelines: 1. To make the people understand the positionof the Philippinesas a member of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the truemeaning of the establishmentof a New Order in the Sphere, and the sharewhich the Philippinesshould takeforthe realizationof the New Order and, thus, to promote friendlyrelationsbetween Japan and the Philippines to the fullestextent; 2.

Manila was stillburning as the lastcorner of Japanese resistance—the Finance Building—wascrushed. When the fightin Manila was over, most of the citylayin ruins, sufferingthe worst damage nextonly to Warsaw, Poland. As General Mac Arthur drove to in spectthe ruinsof Manila, he keenlyobserved: As |passed through the streetswith the irburned-out pilesof rubble, the airstillfilledwith the stench of decaying unburied dead, the tall and statelytreesthat had been the mark of a gracious citywere nothing but ugly scrubs pointing broken fingersto the sky. Once- famous buildingswere now shells(Reportsof Gen. Mac Arthur, 1944). The bombed-out shellsofbuildingswere physicalremindersthatlifeafterthewar would neverbe the same again. As Filipinosmoved on to postwar reconstruction, they would be gripped by a nostalgiafor the nation that was and a sense of mourning for thingslostduringthewar. Risingfrom the ashesofwar, itwas time to build a new nation.

Despite the seeminglyimpossibletaskof rehabilitatingwar-ravaged Manila, the cityrose again. Out of the ashes, makeshiftstructuresbuiltfrom the debrisitselfandother salvagedmaterialsemerged as the period’sarchitecturalsymbol of survival. Inthe midst of postwar destitutionand economic limbo, shantytowns mushroomed sporadicallyin the urban areas in response to the shortage of housing. The residentialarea southofthe Pasig Riverwas transformed earlyin 1945 from an almost unpopulated countrysideto ad hoc communities for med by quonset huts and sheltersoflight materialto addressmassivehomelessness. Financiallybroke, physicallyexhausted, and facinga massive housing crisis, the Filipinos, in the aftermathofwar, found an opportunityto builda new nationand to rectifythe worst mistakesofthe past. Although modernism possessed a symbolic allureof a new architecturefor rebuildinga brave new world ravaged by war, itsexpressioninarchitectureand fearlessavant-gardismtook quitea whilebeforereachingthe Philippineshores. Its localflorescenceinthe latterhalfofthe 1940 s was held in abeyance due to the shortageofbuildingmaterials, the absenceofknowledge in new buildingmethods, the lackoftechnologyand equipment, and, most of all, the postwar austeritythat placedarchitecturalproductiontoa standstill. Modemism had to waitforthe 1950 s when the economic and culturalclimatewas auspiciousenough for itsdevelopment. The Commonwealth government was immediately reconstitutedby President Osmefia on March 7, 1945, and Congress reconvened afterwardto addressthe problems of rehabilitation. Againstthe backdrop of postwar rehabilitation, the last American designerto directlyinfluence Philippineurban architecturewas Louis P. Croft, a Harvard-trainedlandscape architectand engineer. Brought to the Philippinestwo yearsbeforethewar by President Quezon to establishnational parks, Croftvisitedvarioussitesinthearchipelagoand preparedpreliminaryreports on twenty scenicsites.

Collaboratingwith Filipinoplanners, such as Antonio C.

The economic recoveryinthe 1950 s resultedinthesurgeinarchitecturalproduction. The buildingboom was handled predominantlyby ayoung generationofarchitects, the so-called“third-generation Filipinoarchitects,”who readilyaddressed the demands of a clientelewho were eagerto embrace modern lifeand ideas. They were Otilio Arellano, Carlos Arguelles, Cesar Concio, Cresencianode Castro, Gabriel Formoso, Leandro Locsin, Alfredo Luz, Felipe Mendoza, Angel Nakpil, Jose Zaragoza, Francisco Fajardo, Augusto Fernando, Carlos Banaag, Gines Rivera, Antonio Heredia, and the Manosa Brothers(Jose, Francisco, and Manuel Jr.) among others. Architects Cesar Concio and Carlos Arguellesearned the irmaster’s POSTCOLONIAL MODERNITY 369 degrees from the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology; Alfredo Luz had a bachelor’sdegreefrom the Universityof Californiaat Berkeley; while Angel Nakpil held a master’sdegree from the Harvard Universityand was alsoa discipleof Walter Gropius. Leandro Locsin, Gabriel Formoso, and Felipe Mendoza, although the yhad no for eigntraining, were consideredimportantpersonalitieswho shaped the architectureatthattime. The architectureof the early 1960 s maintained the fervorsetinthe 50 s. But the adoption of nostalgicand retrodesignwas a pervasivetheme in the second half of the 1960 s and early 1970 s. A backward-looking aestheticcouched in the retrospectionoflocal traditionsand the vernacularpastmanifesteditselfingraphic design, architecture, in teriordesign, and the alliedarts. Oriental-the med and 370 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 657; Binondo, Manila’s commercial and tradingdistrict was reborn, and businesses boomed in the 1950 s. 6.8 Rizal Avenue, the entertainment and shopping hub of Manila, brimmed with urban vitalityinthe at mosphere of postwar optimism and economic recovery in the mid- 1950 s. 6.9 The group of third- generation, modernist Filipino architectsat the Architectural Center, a building in Makati which resulted from their collaboration, circa 1960 s. tradition-bound in terior design and architecture became the main the matic preoccupation. Though the third-generationarchitectscontinued to promote the modern and progressiveideasoftheir modernistidolsinthefirsthalfof the 1960 s, for betteror worse, a hegemonic modernism in the Philippinesbegan to takeform. Glass-box, high-risebuildings, biomorphic forms, foldedplatearchitecture, and the rational functionalismofthe International Stylewere the principalinterestswhich guided the teachingand practiceofarchitectureinthe Philippinesatthetime. Generally, the architectureof the periodcould be describedasa Third World imitationofthe International Style, bearingno philosophicalagenda or relationto any climatic and culturalcontextofthe place. Inthemidst of the hegemony of the International Style, young architectsand designersof the mid-’60 s began to reappraisethe country’sricharchitecturaland culturalheritageas a sourceofdesign in spiration. They began to questiontherelevanceand authenticityofthisform of architecture thatwas devoid of relevanceand referenceto localor regionalculture, climate, ecology, and historicaltraditions. The serialmonotony of buildingsalloverthe world was becoming veryapparent, and regionalismor the need to expresslocal identitybecame an important parameter in the practiceof architecture. This retrospectionwas partlyfueledby the quest to createa nationalidentityin a postcolonialenvironment, implyingthateveryform of artisticexpressionmust be in grainedwith Filipinoidentity. Thus began the Romantic phase in design and architecturalproduction. The Philippine Pavilionforthe 1964 New York World’s Fair, designed by Otilio Arellano, expressedthedesignsentimentsofthe period, commingling the native with technologicaliconsof the Space Age. Despitethestrongevocationof high technologyand aerospace, the pavilionwas heldhostagetothewell-beatennativist approach, failingtogo beyond the predictabletranslationofthe familiarsalakot, the wide-brimmed farmer’shat. Nevertheless, the message was lucid: modern architectsshould explorevernacularculturalartifactsand similarantiquitiesfor symbols of national identity. POSTCOLONIAL MODERNITY 371 Mapping the Modern Modernism was the leadingmovement of the twentiethcentury architecture, whose of ficialhistorywas writtenin the West. According to thisaccount, which has become a key component of the mainstream cultural history of the twentieth century, “Modernism,” or the “Modern Movement” as itwas then called, encompassed a revolutionaryaestheticcanon and a scientificdoctrinein architectureoriginatingin Europe duringthe in terwarperiod. The use of reinforcedconcrete, steel, and glass, the primacy of cubic forms, geometric shapes, and Cartesiangrids, and, above all, the absence of decoration, stylisticmotifs, traditionalroofs, and omamental detailshave been itsdefiningfeaturesin the twentieth-centuryaestheticconsciousness. For most people, the works of masters Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe epitomized thismodernist aesthetic. Notwithstanding its European or igins, itwas a doctrinethat had claimed universalvalidityand rationality. The new needs, to ols, and technologiesof complex in dustrialsocietiesthat in for med thismodernist visionwere presented as necessaryingredientsfor a rationallyprogressinguniversalhistory—an epochal for cethat no nation, culture, or geography could evade. 2 The terms “modernity,” “modernization,”and “modernism” are in tricatelylinked, but each term needs furtherdistinction. Behind the semantic subterfuge, we can define these terms as follows: modernity as a historicalstage; modernization as a social process that at tempts to constructmodernity; and, modernism as a culturalprocess that takes place at severalpointsalong the development of capitalism. In a broad sweep, modernism encompasses a constellationof in tellectualand artistic movements, which in cludes movements such as impressionism, symbolism, cubism, futurism, art nouveau, imagism, in ternationalstyle, and so on. As an aestheticand culturaltendency, modernism can be broadly defined as a movement grounded in the rejectionof classicalprecedentsand styles.

Though modernism takes place in differentculturalfields, itcould be commonly characterizedas being: positivistic(knowledge and truthsystems isverifiedby way of scientificinquiry); technocentric(progressin knowledge isachievedthrough advances in technology); rationalistic(knowledge isachievedby the applicationof reason); and marked by stronglyheld beliefsin universalprogress, the possibilityof absolutetruth, and the rationalplanning of idealsocialorders. Itcogentlyprofessed the idealsof democraticcollectivism, in dustrializationand machine aesthetics, devotionto a utopian future, and aspirationtowards the creationof a universalculture. Modern architects, in the quest for pure architecture, believedthat buildingsshould stripthemselvesof pretensionsand truthfullyrevealtheirfunction, the irconstruction, and the irorganization, They believedthat buildingswere in tended to be experienced not only in space but alsoin time. To wholly appreciatethe experienceof architecture, the ythought thatone should move through itsspaces, which are simplyshaped by light and massing. The tectoniccomponents and material capabilitiesof the new age should be shown, not disguisedor concealedbehind or namentation. Applied decoration was, hence, no longernecessaryor desirable. In the quest for a universalarchitectural language, context and symbolism became immaterial. Devoid of a culturalor social framework for understandingbuilding, modernism could become a styleforthe entire globe. Modern architecturewas, to a certainextent, a reactionto the extreme or namentation of buildingsof the nineteenth century, an antithesisto grand symmetry and highly decorated surfacesof the architectureof the period. Itwas alsoa politicaland social statement by Europeans to divorce Europe and itsarchitecturefrom itsaristocratic image. Ifanythingwas impliedby the movement, itwas the rejectionof the past and denialof historicalprecedents. In the United States, architects like Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright began to break with the past. Sullivan coined the phrase “form follows function,” a mantra for modernists ever since. The phrase meant that the appearance of a building should be derived solelyfrom itsuse or should grow from itsintended purpose.

After World War |, Germany’s Bauhaus became the locusfor modern design. Artists and designersof thisschoolwanted to gain autonomy from the symbols of European aristocracy, in cludingthe Beaux Arts, and used the machine as the paradigm for their aesthetic. They experimented with forms and designed products that captured the simple beauty of mass-produced forms. They alsoused the machine itselfas a motif. Ocean liners, trains, and skyscrapersfascinatedthem as harbingersof a new age. Many Bauhaus architectslaterfledfrom Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and sought refuge in the United States. Yet, the in fluenceof Bauhaus on modernist architecturewas profound. The demand for standardization, the experimentsin mass production, and the pioneeringconcept of in dustrialdesignallinfluencedthe modernist approach to buildingand design. Proponents of architecturalmodernism in sistedthat itwas a universalform-language, which was applicableto allculturesand societiesat alltimes. Itwas perceivedas a logicalconsequence of rationaldesigninterventionand engagement with new materials and techniqueswhose architecturalproducts were devoid of any signifierof heritageto reiteratethe notions of for mal economy and the dictaof “lessismore.” In the almost prescriptivecatalogfor the 1932 Museum of Modern Art exhibition, Hitchcock and Johnson summarized the modernist stylisticprinciplesin the sewords: “There is, first, a new conception as volume ratherthan as mass.

Modern architecture, in the midst of postwar recuperationand national in dependence, provided the appropriate architecturalimage that representedgrowth, progress, advancement, and decolonization. At thisjuncturein Philippinehistory, architectureand urban planningassumed a significantsiteof politicalcontrolto consolidatethediversedomains of culture, society, and geographyintoa body politicconstitutingthe“nation.”Theadaptation of modern architectureas the of ficialarchitecturalstylewas not arbitrarybut a strategicchoiceforitpossesseda symbolicappeal of technologicaladvancement, economic prosperity, and culturalprogressthatan emerging nationaspiresfor.

Itisparadoxicalto note, however, thatwhilemodernism was viewed by non-Western societiesas a means of creating an identityfreeof Western colonialimages, modernism itselfwassourced from Western ideas. Inthisway, Western domination subtlycontinued. The oldcolonial stylesofarchitecturewere not acceptableas models for new in dependentnations, and in digenous or traditionalarchitecturewas viewed as primitive, rural, and backward. Modernism, the refore, became a popular choice that provided the progressiveimages thatwere beingsought. Thiswas particularlytrueinthecaseof the widespread proliferationof the International Styleintheform of glass, steel, and concretebuildings, which had littleor nothingtodo with the culture, climate, lifestyle, and otherlocalconditions. The designof new capitolsand parliamentbuildingscouldbe viewedasan exercise in the promotionofnational identity, an elevationofnational overregionalinterests, and was symbolic of the nationalunitywithin the new nation despiteethnic diversity.

The death of President Roxas didnot dampen the of ficialand publicinterestinthe capitalcityproject. President Elpidio Quirinocontinuedwhat President Roxas had started. On July 17, 1948, he signed Republic Act No. 333, creatingthe new capitalcityof the Philippinesand the Capital City Planning Commission for the preparationofthe master plan.

Inconformitywith Republic Act No. 333, the Capital City Planning Commission, chairedby Juan Arellano, submitted to the Presidenton March 18, 1949, “The Master Planforthe New Capital City.”The masterplanprovideda detailedurban POSTCOLONIAL MODERNITY 377 framework thatwould ensurethatthe“new Capital Citywhere our constitutional of ficeswillfunctioninan at mosphere of dignity, freedom, and human happiness, willriseas the citadelof democracy in the Orient” (Capital City Planning Commission 1949, 5). Inthe master plan, the entire Capital Citysitewas to be dividedintofour major districts: the Metropolitan Area, the North Neighborhood District, the West Neighborhood District, and the South Neighborhood District. The Metropolitan Area, withan areaof 7,627 hectares, was the locusofthe entiredevelopment and was zoned in to threemain unitsthatformed a triangle. The trianglewas for med by: Constitution Hill, which was locatedon the northeast; the Executive Center (whichconsistedof the Executive Department, the Bureaus, and the main housing projectsforgovernment employees)on the south; and, the Business Centeron the west. Three major thoroughfares, the Avenue of the Republic, Commonwealth Avenue, and Mindanao Avenue, would linkthesethreezones. Bisectingthe trianglewas Congressional Avenue.

Constitution Hillwas to be the siteof the government center. According to the master plan: The center motif and the most beautiful part of the city is the high plateau, which we call Constitution Hill. It will be the seat of the 378 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 6.12 Perspective of the proposed Quezon City Capitol Site,1949 6.13 Plan of the Parliamentary Complex in Constitution Hill, Quezon City Constitutional Bodies distributedin three groups of buildings.

The two agencies, the PHC and the NHC, were subsequentlymerged on October 4, 1947, into what was to be known as the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). Under the guidance of the National Planning Commission and the leadershipof Director Anselmo T. Alquinto(an architectand civilengineer who was a prewar government pensionado to Harvard Universityon town planning and landscapeand a 1949 United Nationsfellowin Europe for town planningand housing), the PHHC designed and developed new and expansive suburban communities, in cludingthe designand mass-fabricationof low-costbungalow units. Under itsauspices, the Kamuning Housing Projectin Quezon Citywas begun in 1940; Project 1 in the Roxas Districtwas concretizedin 1949; followedby Project 2 in the Quirino Districtin 1951. Other housingprojectssuch as Projects 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, allin Quezon City, and Project 16 in Caloocan Citywere consequently completed. On the macro level, the open layout of these developments and the bounding greenbeltsthatsurrounded the secommunities were in accordance with Ebenezer Howard’s concept of a “Garden City.”As for mulated by Howard, the “Garden City”was in tended to bringtogetherthe economic and culturaladvantages of both cityand country living, with land ownership vested in the community, while at the same time discouraging metropolitanspraw! and in dustrialcentralization.

Such configuration employed the “neighborhood unit”—a self-containedresidentialareabounded by major streets, with shops at the in tersectionand a schoolinthemiddle—advocated by Clarence Perryfor New York City in the 1920 s. Perrydefined the neighborhood as a component of a town and quantifieditssizebased upon a five-minutewalking radius. The radiuswas measured from the center, and at the centerwas located the culturalfunctions, such as a school. These projectscontainthreetypesofresidentialunits: the three-storeyrow house- typedwelling, the single-detached-typehouse (identifiedwiththeletter S, i. e.,35- S), and the twinor duplextype(identifiedwiththeletter T, i. e.,40-T), but with the bungalow providinga convenientmodel from which alllow-costhousing was to be patterned.

Some models were provided with carports that converted into play spaces for children when the car was out. New satellitecommunities were also createdto caterto the housing needs of Manila’supper crust. The most prolificdeveloperof exclusivesuburban villages was the Ayala y Compania, which, a decade before the war, consolidated its resourcesand focused on realestatedevelopment. They developed the irfirst subdivisionin Singalong, Manila, marketed to the middle classinthe 1930 s. The development of the new town of Makati was alsoattributedto the Ayalaswho have been closelyadheringto the irmaster planto transform Makati in to the most modern community in the country. In 1931, the ytransformed 930 hectaresofthe or iginal Hacienda Makati, startingwith Forbes Park, in toan in tegratedresidential and businesscommunity under a 25-yearcontrolleddevelopment program. A thirty-eight-hectareareawas setasidetoform a regionalshopping center, which Is now known as the Ayala Center. By the 1950 s, Forbes Park became an exclusive residentialenclavethatattractedaffluentfamilies, for eigncapitalists, business tycoons, and in dustrialmoguls. From Manila’scitycore, the richmigrated to the gated villagesof the suburbia developed by the Ayalas. Between 1952 to 1962, prime residentialcommunities, such as San Lorenzo Village, Bel-Air Village, Urdaneta Village, San Miguel Village, Magallanes Village, and Dasmarifias Villagewere developed in Makati. These exclusivevillageswere sitesof affluenceand architecturaldisplay. Unlike the communities previouslymentioned, the houses with in the seresidentialenclaves were not designed by a company architectbut by an architectcommissioned by the in dividualhomeowner. Hence, the rewere more variantsofmodern residential architecturethatemanated from the template of the bungalow, split-level, and one-and-a-halfstoreyhouses. These houses, as the “the new machine for living in,”in corporatedthe most up-to-datefeatures, such as singlepitchroofs, split- levelroofsand floors, slabs, wallscreens, piercedscreens, wide overhangs, and porte cocheres, and, more of ten than not, took in spirationfrom “California- style”residences. POSTCOLONIAL MODERNITY 387 Laterinthe 1960 s, through the works of architects Luis Ma. Araneta, Leandro Locsin, Gabriel Formoso, Mel Calderon, and Marcos de Guzman, residential architecturebegan to blurtheboundary between the exteriorand the in teriorby in tegratinggardens with in domestic spaces. Locsin’s Residence(1963) in Forbes Park, Makati, challengedtheclimate-in sensitive, dysfunctional, and noncontextual houses copied from American suburbia. This landmark residentialarchitecture was the firstto fullyintegrateindigenousmaterialsinto amodern building. Here, he reinterpretedaspectsof the bahay na bato, such as the latticework, adobe walls, voladas (window galleries), and or ganic continuityand arrangement of spaceswithout superficiallymimicking the or iginalinorderto contemporize the bahay na bato in the cosmopolitan context.

A veranda, for ming an in tegralpartof the structureor, alternatively, at tachedto the outsidewalls, surrounds partor allof the building. Locally, the bungalow was a one-storeyhouse with largewindows and sometimes a lanai. The lanai, derivedfrom Hawaiian residences, was a roofed terracewalled on one, two, or threesides. Bungalows, likethe tsalets, were in troducedin the Philippines during the American period. Those builtin the 1920 s and 1930 s had a porch on the frontand sides. The bungalow could be compact or sprawlingin plan, slightlyelevated from the ground or practicallyon ground level. The bungalow, in itsstnpped, basicform, providedthe model for low-costhousing as the convenientanswer to postwar homelessness. Standard schemes and standardized buildingcomponents were designedby the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) to lend the bungalow to mass-production. The most common variationswere the singleunitand the twin or duplex units. A unithad one small livingroom, one or two bedrooms, and a bathroom. Bungalows of the middle classoccupied lot areas of 200 to 400 square meters. A typicaldwelling had a carport, a livingand dining area, a kitchen, two to three bedrooms, a small garden in frontof the house, and a servicearea at the rear. In the 1960 s, more upper-classbungalows were builtin villagesdeveloped by the Ayalasin the Makati area, such as Forbes Park and Magallanes Villages.

Lateron, the designtrend became more rational, functional, for mal, and rhythmicallyuniform in aspect. The general building mass, although appearing solid, followed a pleasing and disciplined patternaccented by a balanced proportionof harmonized materials and textures. The planschemes were generallyrectangularand simple, of tentimesbased on a modular system of layout. Tones of shades and shadows produced by carefullychosen decorativedesigns of overallperforated, precastsunbafflesand other sun-controldevices brought out the delicatefacade of the buildings. Using exposed aggregate, pebble, and washout finishesgave a subtlecontrasting effectto the exterior. Also noticeablewas the use of contemporary structuraldesigns, such as thinconcrete shellcantileversand plate slabs. Among the buildings fallingunder thistype are the new Philippine Postal Savings Bank Building, the Reforestation Administration Building, the Manila International Airport, the Independence Grandstand, the various multistorey tenement buildings, and others.

Saarinen’s 1940 s structureisconsidered as one of the most in structiveand in spiringexamples of twentiethcentury academic architecture. Here, Bauhaus modernity, traditionalbuilding materials, outstanding urban design, landscaping, and sculpturewere judiciouslyblended to compose a contemporary academic village. Cranbrook’s highestarchitecturalachievement isthe Main Hall’s classicgrand peristyle, which servedas the basisfor Nakpil’scolonnaded centralvoid concept for UP’s Quezon and Gonzalez Halls. Quezon Hall’sarchitect, National Artist Juan Nakpil, did not only take in spiration from the horizontalprofileof Cranbrook’scompositionalmassing but alsoundoubtedly extended the syndrome of architecturalmimicry beyond mere coincidence. Nakpil’s sons, Aristonand Francisco, receivedtheirrespective Master'sdegreesin Architecture at Cranbrook Academy beforethey for med the partnership Nakpil and Sons in 1953. Probably, Juan Nakpil considered Cranbrook as the purestexpressionof a modernist visionfor campus planning. He took the cue from the superior campus planning professedby Saarinenin Cranbrook and sought to reproduce the same in the then new Universityof the Philippinesin the 1950 s. At firstglance, the architecturalimagery and environmentalelements borrowed from Cranbrook makes Quezon Hallan almost perfectfacsimileof the for mer. Yet, Nakpil transcended the sheer architecturalreplicationby extractingfrom Cranbrook the architecturalfundamentalswhich make UP’s Quezon Halltrulyunique and memorable. Such ismanifestedinthe duplicationof the building’sstrategiclocationat the terminus of a long processional approach (University Avenue); the horizontallyoriented volumetricarrangements punctured bya classicgrand peristyleat the center; and the utilizationof landscaping elements, such as a reflectingpool and a sculpture(the Oblation) as a counterpoint. meters by for tymeters was a settingfor reliefsculpturescarved out of adobe depictingthelifeand accomplishments of Manuel L.

Justabove the entrance, a choirloftcould be ascended via a circularwinding stair. The anonymity of softmodernism and the lackof iconographic religiousreferencesunderlinedthe ecumenical aspirationof thisecclesiasticalstructure. Architecturalcritic 1. V. Mallari in his 1957 articlein the Sunday Times Magazine entitled“The Ugly City”identifiedand lambasted specimens of modem architecturein Manila as miniaturizedfacsimilesof modern architectureabroad. His enumeration in cluded Concio’s chapel in Diliman which he claimed to have been drawn from a chapel in Wichita, Kansas. This comparative presumption was too hasty and lacked the value of historicalexplicationto be the sole basis of disputing the church’s conceptual or iginality. Tracingthe genealogyof the architecturalconcept thatthe structuresought to uphold would lead us to no lessthan the Brazilianarchitect Oscar Niemeyer. Niemeyer was best remembered for tropicalizingmodern buildingsby usingadjustablebrise-soleilin hisdesignforthe cityof Brasilia, Brazil’snew capitalinthe mid-fifties. The factthathe was part of Brasiliawas essentialto explainthe conceptual provenance of Concio’s parabolicchurch. But, what could be more illustrativeto explain Concio’simitativetendency (or perhaps a “homage” to his modernist idol)than the photograph of Oscar Niemeyer’s St. Francis Church in Pampulha, Brazil? The Church of St. Franciswas completed in 1943 as partof the Pampulha Lake district. This quarterislooked upon as an earlyexample of contemporary architecturein Brazil, which reached itsclimax in Brasilia. Concio’s and Niemeyer’spaths crossedin the late 1940 s when, in 1947, Cesar Concio was appointed by President Manuel Roxas as a member of the Philippine Government Engineering and Architectural Mission to the United States, South America, and Central America to observetrendsinarchitectureand cityplanningforthe development of the siteand designof buildingsfor the Universityof the Philippinesin Diliman and the National Capitol at Capitol Hills, Quezon City. Included in the itinerarywas a visitto Niemeyer’s of ficein Rio de Janeiro in 1948, where Lucio Costa’s Brasiliamaster plan was being in terpretedat the time. Itcould be surmised that Concio’s encounter with Niemeyer acquainted him with the latter’s corpus of work, where Concio drew in spiration. Concio’s in fatuationwith the tropical responsivenessof Niemeyer’s architectureyieldedmany buildingsthat resonated the judiciousapplicationof brise-soleilin simple lyricalforms (e. g., Palma and Melchor Halls in UP). The strikingsimilaritybetween the Church of St. Francisand the Church of the Risen Lord isincontestable. Theiraffinityextendsbeyond the use of the parabolicshellas the dominant composition as both churches exhibitthe same space planning concept, identicalchoirloftplacement, and matching verticallouvers. The Church of St. Francis was the obviousmodel for Concio’secclesiasticalshell(minus the Catholiciconography, rearparabolictransept, and the taperingcampanile). Seen in the lightof authenticity, itisindeed a successfulknock-off.

An in dustrializedconstructionsystem isa setof buildingpartswhich may be combined or assembled and mass-produced in a varietyof ways to createdifferent buildingconfigurationsviaa highlyorganizedproductionlineof both equipment and labor. There are threetypesof buildingsystemsforindustrializedconstruction: the box system or modular; the bearing panel system; and, the off-sitefabricationwith the assembly on site. The box system is a three-dimensional space enclosing a unit which is usually manufactured at an off-sitelocation. These boxes are eitherload-bearingor stacked on top of the other. They are nonstructuraland are in sertedinto a structuralframe system consistingof prefabricatedcolumns and beams wherein panels and planks are in serted. The system iseconomicallyfeasibleonly for high-riseconstructions. The bearingpanel system isdifferentiatedfrom the box frame system in terms of vertical and horizontalelements. The verticalelements are wall panels in stead of columns, and the horizontalcomponents are floorpanels in steadof beams. The precastpanels are more widely used for buildingconstructionin the Philippines, and a varietyof fabricationprocessesisemployed for the irproduction. The general aim of an off-site fabrication with an on-site assembly process is to minimize on-site construction time. Here, the components are fabricated at the factory and delivered to the site where the bulk of the assembling process is done. The firstprecastconstructionutilizingcolumns, beams, and slabsas wellas stairsand wall panels was employed in 1964 with the Rizal High School, designed by Ruperto Gaite, and thiswas followed by other projectssuch as the Maoay Technical School and the Pasig Expansion School Building. The 1970 s Bagong Lipunan Condominium of the National Housing Authonty utilized composite bearing structuralcomponents, a system patented by Gaite. This four- storeyhousing projectwas erectedin threedays to getherwith the wallsand windows, floorunits, and stairs. The Tondo Foreshore Row-Housing Projectisanother example of a structurebuiltwith concretebearingwallstructuralcomponents. A to talof forty- eightunitswas accomplished in a matter of thirtydays. The grandstands and bleachers of the Marikina Sports Stadium, designed by Gaite and builtby Prestress, Inc., was made with a precast, prestressedstructuralsystem. Prestressingwas employed in most of the precast unitsincludingthe seat risersand channel-shaped wall unit, which had window openings. Post-tensioningwas used for roof girders and columns and for securing the matched-face joint between the cantileveredroof frames and the verticalcolumns. Eight verticalcables were post- tensionedto securethejointsand resistbending moments in the column. Nearly 4,000 tons of precast and prestressedconcrete were erected in only two months. Itwould have taken a year for thisstructureto be erected ifthe conventional construction method was used. The design of the Marikina Sports Stadium receivedan in ternational award in 1974 for itsoutstandingprecastsystem by the United States-based Prestressed Concrete Institute. The lift-slabmethod was adopted at the Club Strata Buildingand the Makati Hotel. Through thismethod, an entirepost-tensionedflatslab floorsystem isfabricatedon ground, one on top of the other, and each isliftedon a predeterminedelevationto the column then anchored through a shear steelblock. Another method was slipforming, which was firstemployed in the constructionof Century Park Sheraton Hotel. Risingat fifteento thirtycentimetersan hour, the to wer was builtof reinforcedconcreteshear wallsusing slipformconstruction, which in volvesinnerand outer form facesopen at the top, in to which concrete ispoured. As recently-pouredconcretecures enough to support itsown weight and retainitsshape, the slipformisinched upward by hydraulic jacksthatclimb on verticalrods embedded in the concrete. Slipformconstructionwas developed in Germany to buildmissilesilosduring World War II.

The recordsof Iglesiani Cristo(INC) revealedthat the campaign to constructmore concretechapelsin the modern Gothic stylecommenced in the late 1940 s and the early 1950 s. Yet as earlyas 1918, itsfounder, Felix Y. Manalo, had contemplated on the need to buildworship spaces for itsincreasingcongregationfor itwas no longer enough to conduct servicesin the houses of itsmembers. Using bamboo and sawali, the constructionof the first Iglesiani Cristokapilyain Tondo, Manila soon followed.

But the modem neogothic, reinforcedconcreteedificecharacteristicof Iglesiani Cristochapels, made itsfirstappearance in 1948 ina sitelocatedin Washington Street(now Maceda), Sampaloc, Manila. The chapel, designedby Rufino Antonio, was a castle-likeconcrete house of worship possessingprecasttraceryand rosetteornaments, loftyspires, and lancet-arched windows—elements that leaned to ward a twentieth century in terpretationof the Gothic style. The structure, alongwith itsdetailsand articulation,© would setthe familiarstylistictemplate for the congregation’slaterworship spaces.

Traditionalnon-Western architecture, which was for merlyviewed as primitiveand backward, now began to be studiedand understood for the irunderlyingprinciplesas wellas the irsocial, cultural, and environmentalrelevance. Former UP Collegeof Architecture Dean Geronimo V. Manahan narratedthe temper of thisperiod in a surveyof twentiethcentury Philippinearchitecture: The conscious architectureof nativeand traditionalforms received greatermeaning. The varietyof regionalconceptions of space was systematicallyanalyzed for territoriality. The appropriation of buildingscienceand new materialsgave distinctvernacularmeaning to the romantic thrustof the period... Regionalismand vernacularwere seen as counterforcesto the worn- out rationaland universalizingtendenciesof modern architecture. Regionalism was treatedas lessconcerned with abstractissuesand more for adding sensual physicalities, depth, and nuances to the Filipino’scomprehension of architecture.(1994, 58) This architecturalretrospectionwas in tensifiedinternationallyby a seriesof publicationsinthe late 1960 sthatreassessedthevalueofvernaculararchitecture. Among them were the now classic Rudofsky’s Architecturewithout Architects (1964) and Rapoport’s House Form and Culture(1969). The iconographiesand culturalpatternsderivedfrom a primevalancestry, asthey existedinthedistantprecolonialsociety, were sourcesofarchitecturalinspiration. This sentimentallongingforthe primevalwas rooted in the notion that these archetypeswere the truefountainheads of identity, of which the citizenrycan sharea collectivememory, and from which the“nationalessence”can be distilled. Thisapproach has produced what Isnow referredto as neovernaculararchitecture, a nostalgicattempt to recreatea stylefrom the past—in thiscase, the vernacular traditions—in the same way thatneoclassicarchitectureapproximates classical motifs. “Folk architecture”and the bahay kubo became architecturalarchetypesinthe quest to forge a nationalarchitecturethat sparked a vernacular renaissance, 444 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 6.95 Cotabato Municipal Hall bringingtotheforean architecturalimageryofhigh ceilings, largecapizwindows, tukod-like(awning)windows, traditionalcarvingand decorativeinteriordetails, and the useofindigenousbotanicalmaterialsand earth-to nedorsepia-varnished in teriorsin Filipinodomestic architecture.

POSTCOLONIAL MODERNITY 449 Re Agret ER 7.1 The Main Theater of the Cultural Philippines Center of the 7 Vernacular Renaissance and the Architecture of the New Society The Marcos Regime and the Promise of National Rebirth The presidencyof Ferdinand Marcos (1965-1986) was a periodofgreat political unrest, transgressionofhuman rights, and greateconomic in stability. Yet, at the outsetof Marcos’sgovernance, the promiseofnational rebirthand resurrectionof old Filipinotraditionswas his principalpreoccupation. The culturaland architecturalagenda of the regime was placed under the auspicesof First Lady Imelda Marcos who took charge of the culturalrenaissanceof the nation using the aestheticmaxim: “the true, the good, and the beautiful.” Marcos’s firstterm witnessedmonumental stridesinagriculture, in dustry, and education. By the middle of hissecond term duringtheearly 1970 s, however, his administrationwas in creasinglytroubledby studentdemonstrations and violent urban guerrillaactivities. Marcos, approaching the end of hisconstitutionally delimitedeightyearsinoffice, decidedto narrow hisgoals. Facedwiththeprospect of anew Philippineconstitution, he pressedfortheadoption of the parliamentary styleofgovernment, which would allowhim to stayinpower in definitely. On September 21, 1972, claimingthatitwas the lastdefenseagainstthe rising disordercaused by in creasinglyviolentstudentdemonstrations and in surgency, Marcos imposed martiallaw. The nationstood ata standstill. Inhisself-authored propaganda book, Notes on the New Society, writtento persuasivelypropagate a sociopoliticalcriterianecessaryinthe foundation of the new socialorder in the form of Bagong Lipunan (New Society), he dramaticallynarratedtheeventsthat justifiedhisdeclarationof martiallaw. In the same propaganda literature, he professedthe ideologicalpromise of the New Societywith an airof nostalgiain making the Philippinesa greatnationonce more. The New Societyrequiredsacrifice from itscitizenswho would undergo the rigorousprocessesofsocial reengineering and culturalrejuvenation. With the declarationof martiallaw, euphemisticallybranded as “constitutional authoritarianism,”power was concentratedin Marcos himself, givinghim absolute and in contestablecontrol over the executiveand legislativebranches of the Philippinegovernment. To complement thisnew omnipotency with a matching image, Marcos encouraged a cult-likedevotion to himselfand hisfamily. First Lady Imelda Marcos’s in volvement in the propagation of thiscontemporary mythology wasfar from merelysymbolic. Her conspicuous participationinaffairs of the state, primanilyincultural, diplomatic, and architecturalmatters, made her the second most powerful, and certainlythe most visible, politicalfigureinthe country. The First Couple jointlyestablishedtheirfirmhold overthe entire New Society, prompting politicalobserverstorefertothetwenty-yearreignasa “conjugal dictatorship.” Inthe periodofdictatorship, President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Romualdez sought to or daina nativecivilizationbred from a Malayan ancestry. For him, the promise of implantingthe eternalvaluesof an imagined “Great Malayan culture”proved to be a potent reason for in itiatingnationalrenewal duringthe Martial Law years. He nurtureda myth for which some historianshad coinedtheterm palingenesisorpalingenetic, a form of utopianism which evoked the ideaofrebirthorspiritualregeneration. Itstressedtheimperativeto reconnect with the pastto promote a “rebirth”of the Great Malayan nationas acommon destiny, the birthrightof a people pilotedby a Great Leader. Itwas the reforemandatory that a nationalculturebe fosteredand preserved. And, in recreating Filipinonationalidentity, Marcos expressed: To be a dynamic in strument of nation-building and social reconstruction, he (the Filipino)the reforeseeks to recuperate his identity. He must get back to hisroots, hisculture. Necessarilyhe must, for the culture of a people is their covenant. It is the distinguishingmark, the source of identitythatsetsthem apartfrom other peoples. Itprovides them in ner strength that shapes their collectivewilloftheirbody politicand the structureoftheir national society. The processof such rebirthisnot on lymonumental; itisalsocomplex as It Iscreative. In resculpturinghis identity, he must, with all consciousness and consummate skilland artistry, dedicate every detailof hisactsand thoughts as purposiveingredientsinthe process of creatinga new Filipino(F.

Through the National Parks Development Committee of which she was the chairperson, she restoredseveralchurches, the wallsof Intramuros, Fort Santiago, Paco Park, Luneta Park, the Goldenberg mansion, Malacafiang Palace, and the Metropolitan Theater, among others, to the irformerglory. For the Metropolitan Theater, Manila’sforemost prewar artdeco landmark, the First Lady allocated 30 millionin August 1979. The bulkofthe renovationbudget came from a loan granted by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) through her Metro Manila Commission. The projectproceeded at an in credible speed, with about 1,600 workerstoilinginthreeshifts. The buildingwas reopened on 11 December 1979, barelyfourmonths in the making. The rationaleforspeedy restorationwas that Mrs. Marcos wanted the projectfinishedbefore Christmasso thatthebuildingwould lookasifitwas a symbolic, multimillion-peso“aguinaldo,” or gift, to the people of Manila.

Imelda Marcos also worked for the construction of several medical in stitutions. She had visited the Houston Medical Center and wanted to have something similar so she or ganized the Heart Foundation of the Philippines “in response to the need fora philanthropic, civic-or ientedinstitutiondedicated to curb the in creasing in cidenceofheart diseaseinthecountry.”To constructwhat isnow known as the Philippine Heart Centerfor Asia(in augurated February 14, 1975), she turned to the GSIS for loans. The so-called“designerhospitals”—the Lung Center, Kidney Institute, Eye Center, Lungsod ng Kabataan (Children’s City), and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine—were collectively Imelda Marcos’s brainchild. The First Lady, through architect Jorge Ramos, also took up the renovation and expansion of the Philippine General Hospital (or iginallydesigned by American architect William Parsons)in Manila to upgrade the facilitiesof public medical in stitutions. The firstphase of the PGH was constructedwithin an Imeldifictimetableto reach its in augurationday on July 2,1985, to coincidewith the birthdayof Mrs. Marcos, the chairpersonof the PGH Foundation. As a way to curb uncontrolledurban population and sprawl, she laidthe groundwork for the Population Centerin 1974. Designed by Leandro V.

In 1979, Imelda, as ministerof Human Settlements, bared her ideaof amodel community plan, a self-reliantand self-sufficientsettlementdesignedforfiftyto 100 familiesin a two-and-a-halfhectarearea, known as the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sitesand Services(BLISS).

She envisioneda more rationally planned Manila to be repositionedfartherinland, up in the virtually-unpolluted Sierra Madre foothillseast of Manila Bay. The preciselocation, asshe pointedout in her speech, “Earth: The Cityof Humanity,” deliveredat the United Nations Conferenceon Human Settlementsin Vancouver on June 7,1976, was a conclusion arrivedat by Filipinoscientistsheaded by Dr. Celso Roque usingan “ecological in for mationdecisionsystem,”which used a computer-generated land use map thattook in to account the preservationofthe ecologicalattributesofthe area. As envisioned, Lungsod Silangan would sprawl over 20,300 hectares of prime agriculturaland for estedland in Antipolo. The pilotcommunity named Bagong Nayon (New Town), whose master plan was made by the Planning Resources VERNACULAR RENAISSANCE 467 The Schoolhouses of the Marcos Era To effectivelyaccomplish the agenda of socialreorientation, culturalrenaissance, and nationalrecovery, literacywas one of the main prioritiesof the Marcos regime. Itbuilt a network of educational in frastructuresfor primary, elementary, and secondary in structionthroughout the country, reachingthe remotest barriosof the archipelago. This was accomplished through the mass-built Bagong Lipunan Type School Building, which had a sixby twenty-four-meterplan. The designwas craftedby the Ministryof Public Works and Highways. Later, the same agency, through its Building Research and Development Staff(BRDS) at tempted to in fuseindigenousdesignsto these plain and monotonous schoolbuildingsinkeepingwith the First Lady’sunwaveringpromotion of nationalidentityin architecture. Various schemes of vernacular-in spired Bagong Lipunan Schoolhouses The time-and cost-savingsystem held by the technologyof prefabricationallowed new school buildingsto be mass-produced at low costand erectedefficientlyon site. The so- called Marcos Pre-Fabwas developed by the Philippine Constructionand Development Corporation (PHICONDEC) in the late 1970 s. The design of the Marcos Pre-Fabwas based on the system for prefabricatingwall panels, floor beams, and floor slabs applied earlierby PHICONDEC in a low-costhousing project. The scheme shown in the accompanying drawings utilizedthe same dimensions of the standard Bagong Lipunan Type School Building. Only fourtypesofwall panels, fourtypesof floorbeams, and two typesof floorpanelswere necessary—allof prefabricatedconcreteof reduced thickness. Because of the reduced thickness, components were lightweightand could be cared and erectedby two to four men. The assembly of components was twiceas fastas compared to more conventionalmethods of construction. A typical Bagong Lipunan Schoolhouse 468 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 7-29 Assembly of modernist cubic mass constituting the architectureof the Philippine International Convention Center Operations Systems(PROS), was in auguratedin 1977.

The satellitecitythatboasted of its abilitytoabsorb 200,000 familieswas meant tobe “a stagingground for expanding the boundaries of Metro Manila to wards Infanta-Realin Quezon Province, right of ftheedge of the Pacific Ocean” (Nells-Lim June 1981, 59). Bagong Lipunan Modernism and the Invention of National Architecture The desirefornationalself-assertioninbuiltform had a profound repercussionon both designedspace and architecturaldiscourse. Encouraged by Imelda Marcos, a wave of nostalgia in architectureemerged in thispostcolonialsociety, valorizing the primordialand coloniallifestyleand rekindlingthe fireof the golden past in contemporary builtenvironments.

Locsin’sapplicationofabstractexpressionisttenetsto distilltheessential and floatingqualitiesof the bahay kubo prompted Nick Joaquin(1969,68) to hail Locsin’s Cultural Center buildingas his“most daringand dramatic sculpture.” A more profound allusionto the bahay kubo and a slightdeparturefrom his modernist boxinesswas Locsin’sdesignforthe National Arts Center (1976). Acquiringoutrightinspirationfrom early Philippineedifices, the Makiling National Arts Centerwas Mrs. Marcos’sreimaginationofthe mythical Temple of the Muses at Mount Parnassus. Locsin’sneovernacularversionof the temple was a building dominated by a huge, truncated, pyramidal, tiledroofsupportedatthefourcorners by eighttriangularbuttresses.

VERNACULAR RENAISSANCE 475 The National Building Code Before 1972, Philippinecitieslike Cebu, Baguio, and Manila had the irrespective buildingcodes mostly from the cityordinances compiled by practicingarchitectsand engineers. Some of the provisionswere extractedfrom the codes of citiesabroad. In 1972, Congress passed Republic Act 6541, entitled“An Act to Ordain and Institutea National Building Code of the Philippines.”But thiscode failedto declareitssupremacy over citychartersand localordinances, lackedsanctionsand penal provisions, and the commission which was taskedto implement itwas nullifiedby the abolitionof Congress when martiallaw was declared. To conform with the developmental goals of the government and availalso of the expertiseof men in the privatesector, President Marcos or dered the revisionof R. A. 6541 and issued Presidential Decree 1096 or the National Building Code of the Philippines on February 19, 1977, to safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare consistent with sound environmental management and control. President Marcos rationalizedthisdecree: the country’sacceleratingeconomic and physicaldevelopment, coupled with urbanizationand populationgrowth, makes imperativethe for mulation and adoption of a uniform buildingcode which shallembody up-to-date and modern technicalknowledge on buildingdesign, construction, use, occupancy, and maintenance (Presidential Decree 1096). To thisend, the code proposes to provide allbuildingsa framework of minimum standards to regulateand control the irlocation, site, design, qualityof materials, construction, use, occupancy, and maintenance. To thisday, the National Building Code, containingtwenty-on echapters, remains applicablein the design, location, use, occupancy, maintenance, moving, demolition of, and additionsto publicand private structuresexcept to traditionalindigenous familydwellings.

The regime’smassiveloaned in vestmentsinbuildingswere to project to the in ternationalcommunity an impressive myth of “overnight in dustrialization”and to renderan illusionoffast-pacedprogressatwork in the country. The myth of modernity implicated the use of a historicalmodern architecturalgrammar. In building her monumental romantic nationalist architecture, Imelda, in steadof breakingaway from the past, encouraged her architectsto conjureself-consciousvernacularallusionsand iconography. The architecturaland aestheticprogram slavishlyborrowed iconsfrom the remote pasttobe imitated, in terpreted, and improved upon and capitalizedon the nostalgic allegoryof a lostage and a utopian metaphor for the futureworld in the New Society. Through publicmonuments, nationalmemory was the reforeconstructed or in vented. Itsnarrativewas meant to in spirenationalismand the sacrificeof the selfforthecommon good. By the early 1980 s, new economic and politicalweaknesses had become obvious, signallingthe declineof the Marcos regime. Huge in vestments in signature architectureand in frastructureresultedindeficitsthatwere farbeyond the domestic economy’s abilityto absorb. Marcos’sextravagantmodern erections, which acted asa veilto concealthe in flationaryconditionscripplingthe Philippineeconomy, can no longerhidetheailingconditionof the nation. As the economy plummeted, many Filipinodesignand constructionprofessionalssufferedunemployment and decided to work overseas. The migrationof laborsiphoned many architectsand designersto the oil-producingcountriesof the Middle Eastthatwere converting petroleum revenueintoinfrastructureinvestment.

Designstrategieswere reevaluatedto achieveenergy-efficientarchitecture amid the economic slump. Modern buildingsofthe in ternationalstylewere heavy consumersofenergyastheyrelygreatlyon the technologyofartificialventilation and air-conditioningto providecomfortableinteriorlivingconditions. Moreover, Filipinoarchitectswere compelled to reassesslocalbuildingtraditionsand vernaculararchitecturalsymbols to addressthe need fora more energy-efficient and culturally-responsivetropicalarchitecture. They saw the potentialofvernacular architectureas a solutionincombining the parameters of climate, culture, and craft. Regionalismor the expressionofthe localidentityof a particularregionthus became a factor in architecturalpracticeas well as architecturaleducation, particularlyinnon-Western societiesand developingeconomies. Earlyresponses to regionalismwere mostlysuperficialand copyist—traditionalforms, colors, roof silhouettes, and decorativemotifswere merelyappliedor appended to the facades of in ternationalstyledesigns. Numerous examplesofthis appliqué areseen not on lyinthe Philippinesbut alsointhe Middle Eastand Southeast Asiaduringthe 1970 s. In 1981, Geronimo V.

His grandest and most impressivework was for Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, a commission he had won in an in ternationalcompetitionin 1980. The sultan’s Istana Nurul Iman (Palaceof Religious Light), completed in 1984, reinterpretedthe traditional Islamic Southeast Asian motifs along the grammar of modernism. Undeniably, the Istana Nurul Iman shared the same dynamism and compositional massingwith Locsin’searlierwork, the 1970 Philippine Pavilionfor the Osaka World Exposition.

This isachievedthrougha successfultransformationofmodernistcubicalforms into crispgeometriesthatare tropicallyresponsiveand sensitiveto localidentities. 484 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 57 Development Academy cf e Philippinesin Ortigas, Pasig Mendoza succeeded in doing thiseven with out resortingto exoticism, folkloric consumption, and automatic graftingofpredictable Philippineculturaliconsto assurethecommitment to nationalidentityprevalentduringhistime. Afterforginga partnershipwith Gabino De Leon and Homero Ingles, he established in 1951 hisown architecturaloffice, which bore hisname. Through thisfirm, he continued to design buildingsstamped with hisdistinctarchitecturalstyleand philosophy deservingrecognition. Among the benchmarks of hisaestheticand functionalachievements were the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Ministryof Educationand Culture Building, Ministryof Foreign Affairs Building, Development Academy of the Philippinesin Pasig, Philippine Veterans Bank along Bonifacio Drive, Antonino Buildingin Luneta, Great Pacific Life Buildingin Makati, Church of Jesusof Latter Day Saintsin Green Meadows, in stitutionalbuildingsfor Bicol University, Palawan National Agricultural College, Mariano Marcos State University in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Central Mindanao Universityin Musuan, Bukidnon, Universityofthe Philippines Los Banos, and Collegeof the Holy Spirit. As a trueadvocateofarchitecturaltropicalism, Mendoza considerednatureand ecologicalconcers in hisapproach to design. He was meticulousabout on entation 58 International Rice search Institutein Los Bafhos, guna VERNACULAR RENAISSANCE 485 when planninga buildingand made the fullestpossibleuse of naturallightand ventilation. Through the use of largeopenings, wide eaves, balconies, and lush in teriorgardens, he brokethestrictboundariesbetween the outdoor and in door, making the architecturevirtuallya permeable mesh. Thispermeabilityofstructure permittedhisarchitectureto negotiateand establishrapportwith the tropical environment, endowing architecturalvolumes witha distinctlymodem yettropical character. Forthright Modernist Gabriel Formoso’s (1915-1996) works were characterizedby an almost religiousadherence to the doctrineof modernist architecturalconcepts. He had designedstructuresthatarenow considered outstanding specimens of Filipino modern architecture. His years in practice were spent fruitfullyin designing and planning clubs, residences, hotels, in dustrialand commercial buildings, inns, and recreationalcentersthattotaled to eightybuildingsand more than 150 residences. SS His architecturewas contrivedwithin the mantra of starksimplicity, austere configuration, honestyofmaterials, rationalfunctionalism, and clinicalefficiency. He describedhiswork as the embodiment of “honesty of conception and the principledconcern for human requirementstranscendingthe irrelevanciesof prejudiceand in stinct.”Formoso’s disciplinedpracticestrivedfor a builtand designed environment with a three-foldobjective: first, to communicate lived human experiencespatially; second, to underscore the socialdimension of the architecture, emphasizing the dialogicrelationshipof architectureand society; and, to probe in to the questionofidentityby implicatingthecultureand climatein the designofstructures. Bearingthemodernistfervor, Formoso’swork focusedon volumetricmanipulation ratherthan decorativeostentation, restraintratherthan in dulgence, simplicity ratherthancomplexity, asallirrelevancieswere purged from the structure, allowing buildingsto revealtheirinnertruths—the honesty of material, the in tegrityof structure, and the logicof utility. The verticaland horizontalvolumes of his architecturewere juxtaposed to spark austeretensionand generate minimalist sculpturalgeometries. The outcome were elevationsthatwere unclutteredand relianton the bulk of elementsforcharacter, making the irdistinctsilhouetteand Spartan dispositionstand out in the overallfabricof the irvicinity.

The firm, known as the Mafiosa Brothers, was a success in vernacular experimentation, yieldingthe Maranao-in spired Sulo Restaurant in Makati in the 1960 s and the San Miguel Headquarters Building in the 1980 s.

This demanded the creationof a stateguesthouse thatwould showcase Filipinoidentitythrough the extensiveuse of in digenous materialsand displaythe myriad architecturalapplicationsand possibilitiesof the coconut treeand itsby-products.

The Paradigm Shift Modernism in the Philippineswas beginningto loseitsground by the 1980 s. The canons of modern architecturewere seen to have createda serial anonymous product, epitomized by sterilebox to wers and concrete blocks. There was a full-scalecondemnation of the modernist movement, a reaction againsta buildingstylenow found to be boring, in differentto itssurroundings, and devoid of historicaland culturalassociations. Such deficiencywas momentarily mitigated by regionalism’s contextual approach, which consciouslyincorporatedthe history, culture, and traditionofthe siteinthe design of buildings. But an all-pervasivestylewould soon engulf the architecturallandscape, servingas an antidoteformodernism’s renunciation of historyand tradition. This began a new period which liberateddesigners from the stern modernist paradigm and sanctioned an “anything-goes” exuberance to craftpluralisticarchitecturalexpressions.

Postmodernism in architecturebegan as an academic movement in the late 1960 s as a counter-reactionto the rigidityand hegemony of the universalmodernism of the mid-twentiethcenturyinthe Western hemisphere. Architecturaltheoristsmaintained thatthe messages or meanings conveyed by the buildingsmust be complex, in trinsicallycontradictory, and that historyand symbolism could no longerbe disregarded. They declaredthat, since modern architecturedid not value notions of historicalfundaments and the communicative potentialofarchitecture, itleftus alienatedand estrangedfrom the modernist boxes and utopian aspiration. American the or istand architect Robert Venturi, one of the firstto swervefrom the modernist dogma, found in spirationinthe kitschand glitzof the commercial advertisingof Las Vegas astheframework to erectthefoundation of postmodern architecture. The genericapartment blocksand glasstowersof the modern canon seemed to him humorlessand soulless, lackingthevitalitywhich diversitybringsto 8.2 Makati’s Ayala Avenue in the 1980 s the urban landscape. Venturieven extolledthearchitecturalvirtuesof artdeco and admired the gaudinessof Las Vegas as the new designparadigm. He lambasted Mies Van Der Rohe’s famed minimalist dictum “lessismore” with the counter doctrine “less isa bore.” He summoned architectsto enrich the experience of| architecture by making deliberate use of the multiple connotations of the architecturalsign.“A validarchitecture,”Venturiproclaimed in 1966, “evokes many levels of meaning and combinations of focus: its space and its elements become readable and workable in several ways at once.” Architects soon became aware of the linguisticaspectsof architectureand itscapacityto connote and denote meanings. The linguisticmandate of postmodernism generateda kindof architecturethatcollapsesfamiliarhistoricalreferencesintodeflatedimages and ambiguous spatialityinorderto engage people with familiarimagery, allowing them to freelydecipherthemultiplemeanings of buildings. Postmodernism adopted a populistaestheticlanguage heavilyinfluencedby classicalarchitecture. Itworked likedecorativepackaging, reanimating the otherwiseuninterestingfacadesbyjuxtaposingsymbolicelementsand enveloping them with ironyand metaphor. Visually, postmodernism isexemplifiedby the garishapplicationofcolor, returnto or nament and traditionaldesignelements (suchas gables, Palladianwindows, conicalroofs, classicalorders, pediments, elaboratemouldings, overscaledarches, and robustmasonry details), and eclectic mix-and-match of everyimaginabledetailforan ostentatiousfacade effect. It allowedpastiche, the unrestrictedjuxtapositionofstylisticelementsfrom radically differentcontexts and epochs, to preside over itscompositional strategy. Postmodernism permittedgreatertolerancefordiversestylesto coexist, ranging from conservativeimitationsofclassicalarchitectureto flamboyant, kitsch, and playfullyoutrageousdesigns. The flexibilityofpostmodernism thatallowedtheeclecticcombinationofdecorative elementsscavengedfrom the catalogueofferedby architecturalhistorywas prone to abuse and misuseby in discriminatedesigners.

Moreover, thisiconologicalemphasis of postmodern buildingsmoved the professionaway from structuralinnovationand socialissues and much closerto the tacticsof consumer marketing.

The past is recuperatedin fragments that can be packaged and consumed at the present time, yetthe fullcontextof each memory isdismissedand recollectionisthus trivialized: itisthe “quaintness”of the pastthatisreutilized. Our memories are partialforwe areenamored with the ideaofold gloriousfiguresand we construct their“difference”from us, irrespectiveof our continuities. The simple, pure, or dered, easy, beautiful, or harmonious pastisconstructed(and then experienced emotionally)in conjunctionwith the present—which, in turn, isconstructedas complicated, contaminated, anarchic, difficult, ugly, and confrontational. The aestheticsofnostalgiamight, the refore, be lessa matterofsimplememory than of complex projection; the in vocationof a partial, idealizedhistorymerges with ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 527 dissatisfactionwiththepresent. Our recollectionistrivialforitsimplifies, distorts, and disrespectsthecontinuityofhistorictime. Accordingto Christine Boyer(1996), speakingof the new urban spectacle, we are ina “crisisofcollectivememory”—a shared disjunctionofour linkswith the past. This isentwined with the rapid urban changes brought by modernization and in dustrializationwhich rupturethe myriad of ways in which citiesplayhost to a collectivesenseofhistory. The crisisofcollectivememory provokes a neurosisto desireand to recollectthe past only ina to ken manner and to reframe itinthe urban scenography. Such scenographicrepresentationsrepressthe mysteryand disorderof urban life, which isreduced to idealizedbut fragmentary “scenes” manifestinginshopping mallsand gated communities. A potent example isthe manner by which the Alabang Town Center has confiscatedthe Spanish baroque elements of our colonialpast, and sought to reframe itin a quaint, provincial market-town thatitneverwas. Utilizing Spanish Missionarchitecturalelements— thickwalls, deep recessedopenings, arcades and to wers, balconies, tileroofs, eaves, and wood frames-—itinsinuatesa nostalgiafora falsehistoricalpast more Spanish Mexico-Californiathan Colonial Philippines. Another nostalgicallusion isthe Power Plant Mall at Rockwell; so named as to recallthe in dustrialpastthat the buildinghad representedformore than halfa century. The architecturerecalls the memory of the placeonlyinname and but failsto bestow recognizableimages from the pastas itsiconography ismore of the Moroccan marketplaces.

With the proliferationofmiddle-classand upper-middle-classgatedcommunities, new forms of exclusionand residentialsegregationare created, exacerbatinga socialpolarizationthatalreadyexists. Suburbanization, in particular, has created and maintained patternsof segregationthat have directlycontributedto the development of gated communities. Historicalresearchpointsto the evolutionof the suburb as an exclusionaryenclave. From itsearliestbeginnings, the suburb has been an “anti-urban”community where the upper-class, followedby the middle- class, residentssearched for sameness, status, leisure, and securityin an ideal “new town” or“green oasis.”Inthelate 1980 s, realestatespeculationaccelerated the buildingofgated communities around golfcoursesdesigned for exclusivity, prestige, and leisure. Scholars also suggested three primary motivations in residingin a gated community—protectionof the amenitiesassociatedwitha certainlifestyle(centered 530 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO 8.69 Tagaytay Highlands on clubs, sports, and leisure); projectionof an eliteimage and exclusivecompound (protectionofthe richand famous from the publicgaze); and securityagainst crime. The securedenclavesand walledarchitecture, made possiblethrough the in stallationof guardhouses, walls, and entrance gates in established neighborhoods, are responsesto risingurban paranoia and criminality. As the politicaland economic democratic practicesthatmediated some forms of class separation in the builtenvironment break down, the creationof new gated communitiesissoughttomaintainthesocialhierarchyand statusquo. The protected domain of the gated neighborhood thus of fera communal camaraderie of the privileged, shieldedagainstthe poverty-strickenclass. Recently, the concept ofa “self-containedleisureparadise,”such as Tagaytay Highlands, hascreatedan idealcommunity combining the conceptsofrecreational or ganicfarming, a theme park, a resort, a golfcourse, and a mountain hideaway. A Tagaytay Highlandspublicistmaintained: Ah, picturesque Tagaytay Highlands. Ifyou everhave a chance to tag along with a member of this exclusive(for members only)community and catch a glimpse of the 900-hectare leisureestate of fering spectacularviews of Taal Lake then leaveyour worries behind the urban lowlands. Stressdoes not belong in thispostcard-perfect setting. But there’smore to Tagaytay Highlands than justcleansing one’s body and soul. Behind the 6,820-yardchampionship golf course, the sportsfacilities, luxurylog cabins, Swiss chalet-styledcondominiums, and Spanish- Mediterranean houses are gesturesof respectand gratitudeforthe environment. Mother Nature, afterall, is a permanent member of Tagaytay Highlands, and she holds a powerful seat in the club’s hierarchy(Salazar, September 4,2003). The enclavedevelopmentisa packagedversionofa dream ofan idealcommunity— pure, secure, and natural. An in ventoryof the subdivisionnames of a leading, middle-classsubdivisiondeveloper, such as Sta. Lucia Realty, isa telltalesignof ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 531 such a tendency and marketing ploy. Placenames appropriated by Sta. Lucia Realty—Acropolis Greens, Baybreeze, Greenland, Greenwoods, Glenrose, Evergreen, Glenwood, Golden Meadows, Lakewood, Meadowood, Mira Verde, Parkhills, Ridgemont, Summerhills, and Valley Viewamong others—would reveal a consistenttoponymic theme evocativeof a refreshingimageryof nature. As the names of subdivisions hint, the dream of suburbiaisan escape from the cityto a lifeenveloped by nature. The suburban home isa symbol of an escape not only from the cosmopolitan environment but also from the broader problems of everyday life. Suburban domesticitydoes not only provide a sanctuary, itactivelyparticipatesin the production of domestic fantasiesas well. Thematic subdivisionsand gated communities exploitedthe Filipinofixationwith anythingforeignby creatingan illusionaryneighborhood with the aura of a“Mediterraneanvilla”or an “American suburbia.”The house isa symbolic package establishingthe statusand refined tasteof itsoccupants.

Yet, the adventof the supermallis fairlyrecent, which could be tracedasa post-Marcos, urban phenomenon, creating an alternative, quasi-publiccongregationalspace in privatelyowned estates. The latestconcepts in the design of retailmall environments are embodied by the architecturesof SM Mall of Asia (2006), Gateway Mall (2004), and Ayala Greenbelt(2004). The lasttwo have been verysuccessfulinrevitalizingtheworn- out districtswithintheirrespectivevicinities—Cubaoand Makati. ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 533 The development of large-scaleretailenvironmentshas alwaysbeen at tributedto Shoe Mart (SM), which began as a modest shoe storein Carriedo, Manila, in 1958. Owned by Henry Sy, a nativeof Fujian Province, China, the establishment came up with a for mula fora surefire, in come-generatingstrategyby sellingshoes in largequantitiesat very low prices, resultingin the swiftturnover of stocks. Venturingintoothermerchandise, such astextilesand household goods, Sy opened hisfirst Shoemart department storein Makati in 1962, followedby one in Cebu in 1965 and another in Cubao in 1967. While other developersstayed away from new businessventuresduring the economic recessionof the 1980 s, Sy in vested capitalintonew businessdealsand began to buildhiscolossalmalls. The first SM, as Shoemart Isnow called, rosein Cubao in 1985, in the wake of the crisiscaused by the Ninoy Aquino assassination. Shortlyafterthe EDSA Revolutionin 1986, SM City North in Edsa was built, followedinrapidsuccessionby SM Megamall (1991) in Mandaluyong, SM City Cebu (1993), SM Southmall (1995) in Las Pihas, SM lloilo(1999), SM Pampanga (2000), SM Davao (2001), SM Cagayan de Oro (2002), SM Baguio (2003), and SM Batangas (2004). In 1992, the six-storey SM Megamall, designed by architect Antonio Sindiong, earned itsdistinctionas the “largestmall in Asia,”with itsconcept of a “self- contained city”spanning halfa kilometerlong. The SM chain of department storesusedto be identifiedwith“shoebox architecture”(perhapsinremembrance of SM’s humble or igins)distinguishedforitstemplateof awindowless, brutalist facade whose median was accentuatedby the huge, blue, backlitlettersof “S” and “M.” Renovationsand new constructionsbegan shedding monotonous and unremarkablepresenceinsupportofplural imageryand consumption-stimulating facades.

The canopies are arranged in such a way that both sunlightand strong breezesreach the promenade areason the mall’sground floor. As of 2008, the number of SM Supermalls have reached the 33 rd mark with more than 4.1 millionsquare meters of combined gross floorarea.

These triumvirateurban environments play host to fantastic 542 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO architecturalsetpieces, boastinga master plan thatpurgesthe harsh realitiesof Third World urban conditionsand deviatesfrom the pitfallsofotherworld cities. They are“ideal”urban environmentsbrought about by the globalizationofcapital that reflectsthe logicof corporate consolidationand conflationof publicand privatecooperation. To be in these places isto be seemingly a part of an environment of luxury and to for get(at leastforawhile)the squalorcaused by widespread urban destitution. Theorizing the Global/Local in Relation to Urban Placemaking Itisassumed thatthespatialand architecturalmanifestationsofwhat we crudely refertoas“globalization”can be sighted/sitedinthe CBD (centralbusinessdistrict), the downtown, as evidenced by the presence of multinationalcorporation headquarters, in ternationalbanks, or the pervasivesign of franchisedglobal corporations, such as Mc Donalds, Nike, Sony, etc. Though the seevidencesare quiteobvious, the reismore to the effectsofglobalizationupon urban placemaking and architecturalproduction. What we need to know, as Crang (1999) suggests (drawing on and condensing Henri Lefebvre’s[1991] three key concepts of “representations of space, spatial representations, and representational practices”), ishow globalizationphenomena take place through “conceived, perceived, and livedspaces”and in changing patternsofspatialproduction and consumption. The notionofglobalizationinitiallystrikesus as ahomogenizing for cethatseesthe world as a singleplace(Robertson 1992, 30). Without a doubt, the worldwide revolutionincommunications and the globalecological, political, and economic affairsfacilitates“in tensificationof the consciousnessof the world as a whole” (Robertson 1992, 18). Other scholarshave pointedout the repercussionsofthis phenomenon in the urban form through the notionof“world cities,”referringto thoseplacesthattakeon particularorganizationalstructuresand otherfunctions in the world economy (Freidmann 1986) resultingin the irhaving distinctive economic, social, spatial, and architecturalcharacteristics. The awareness of the in terconnectednessamong the seurban centershas spawned the ideaof“global cities,”a term used by Sassen (1991) to referto those unsurpassed lociinthe Pi.83 World-class buildings iside the Eastwood City 1 clave ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 543 world economy—such as New York, London, and Tokyo, with the irassembly of in ternationalbanks, multinationalheadquarters, and unique occupational features—whichareassumed to possess“globaicontrolcapability.” These globalizationtheoriesprovideseminalsuggestionsforunderstandingurban transformation and architecturaldevelopment.

Such competitivegesturesinfluence the manner by which urban projectsand in frastructuresareformulated, designed, and implemented. Beforeturningto the localmanifestationsofthis global-urbanparadigm shiftin Manila, the discussionofglobalizationmust in cludesome issueslinkedwith its consequences on urban architectureand planning. The dominant tropesby which the sepackaged urban citiesbecome presentinthe local/globalarena must be fleshedout. There isa sweeping polarityand contradictionbetween the localand globalforces on both culturaland economic spheres. Localcultureisingrainedina community of face-to-faceencounters and in fusedwithin the matrices of everyday life; consensual memory isgrounded in a particularlocality. Localities/localplaces assume “localcharacter”based on the summative or combinatorialcharacterof the in habitants’basisofself-definition—ethnicity, gender, class, and age—which are layeredwith an amalgamation of culturalgeography, urban form, and architecture. The local, with itsmultifacetedcharacter, may seem in significant with respectto the global, yetas Hannerz (1996, 28) maintained in hisbook, Transnational Connections,“in aggregateitismassive.” Localdifferencesand nuancesof urbancharacterareappealingtoglobalmarketing stratagems. Digressingfrom the concept of globalizationas a homogenizing process, Robertson suggeststhatsuch a processisfilteredthrough and mediated vialocalculture, histories, politicalpower, geography, fluctuationsincapital, and the policiesof localspaceofa givenstate. Resultingmanifestationsof the process, 544 ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO representedthrough the transformationofthe builtand designed environment, are modulated through the rules, mores, codes, and policiesof the in dividual placesand states. Thus, the logicof globalcapitalisrearticulatedby the local culturetodispensea unique urban texture. Globalizationdoes not simplymediate and dissolvedifferencesbetween cities, italsocatalyzesthem. The differencewill be the sellingpointofany cityasan economic spacethatservesas a conduitwhere globalcapitalflows. The localcharacterof the urban scenography becomes the basisformarketingthecity.

For in stance, Manila’sglobalcitiescapitalizeon the semioticcapacityof architectureto in vokescenographiciconography plusan image-making strategy heightenedby placenaming and culturalassociationsto fabricatethe identityof a particularcity. Fort Bonifacio Global Cityischarged with historicalallusions pertainingto the Philippinerevolutionaryhero, Bonifacio; Eastwood City Cyber Park passesitselfof asa mecca of in for mationtechnology; buildingsin Rockwell Centerarenamed after Philippineartmasters, such as Joya, Rizal, Amorsolo, and Manansala, to bestow the urban space with a culturalpedigreethatwas never there. Here, localplaces are then appropriated for global strategies. Urban marketing requirescivicimagery, which can identifyplacesand citiesas different products and packaged landscapes. Thiscatalyzesthe market for iconicimagery entrenched in “signaturearchitecture”designed by world-renowned and high- profilearchitectsand planners, who both work to signifya genus loci(senseof place)for globalconsumption and to ensureitsvalueas a “symboliccapital.”The competition for buildingthe tallestbuildingispartand parcelofthis discourse where the citybecomes a “prop” for the“world stage”(King 1997). Thisprinciple appliesto a rangeofscales, from a mere background to a CNN televisioninterview, to smallerscaleimages, such as streetlife, to be used in civicmarketing. Cities with out recognizablearchitecturalicons(think Eiffel Tower in Paris, Manhattan skylinein New York, Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, or Millennium Dome in London) arenot in the market. Sakia Sassen (1994) maintained the notion that competition among citiesfor large-scaleurban developments lends power to globaldeveloperswho obtain concessionsfrom the localgovernment through the threatof reallocatingtheir flexiblecapitalto another place.

Local governmentsseekinvestorsand of ferlargechunks of publiclandsorin-fillproperties for megaprojects, which are of ten mixed-zones of upscale consumption and housingenclaves. But the“mixed” criteriainsuch projectsareformulas based on the consumption of a specificmarket sector, the reby heighteningthe spatial detachment of the socialclass. As thisdichotomous landscape to ughens the boundaries and fixesidentityat one surface, at another stratum the yconstruct what Zukin (1995) terms as spaces of “liminality’—spacesbetween categories and identitieswhere publicand privateinterestsarefalsified. In a sense, thisis similarto the realm of the shopping mall at a magnitude of urban scale—a de- politicized,“psuedo-public”realmopen to publicaccessbut lackingthespontaneity and freedom of a publicdomain. A coalitionisforged between the publicstate and the privateestate, whereby publicinterestissignifiedwhileprivateinterestis served; publicmeanings aremaneuvered by privatecontrol. Likeinthemall, these urban spacesgeneratea zone where vagrancies, deprivation, and politicalactsare evictedfrom itspremiseswithoutforfeitingthe legitimacyofthe state. The liminalzones amalgamate and demolish boundaries between cultureand consumerism. Heavy in vestment in publicart becomes meshed with the logo techniquesof advertisinginwhich the framing, location, and content of artare geared to wards the spectacleofconsumption. Publicartbecomes neutralizedby corporatesponsorship, with subtlecensorshipofany ideathatdoes not catalyze or mechanize consumer fantasies.

Itcolonizestheconsciousnessofthe passersbythrough the alchemy of advertisingstrategies—signages, paving patterns, billboards, and corporate architecture—makingitspresencefeltinthestreetscapethatconstantlybombards one’svisceralself. The cultureof both the masses and the eliteiscolonizedas publicmuseums, galleries, sportingarenas, and even educationalinstitutions become activesitesofcorporateevents(NBC tentin Fort Bonifacio, Lopez Museum and Ateneo Graduate School in Rockwell, and International Center of Information Technology Educationin Eastwood City). Such facilitiesareconstructedto imbue corporatedealingswithan auraofcivilityand culturalpedigree, creatingan alluring environment bereftof the vagariesof urban lifeand concealingor disguising economic exchange relationsamong economic actors. Commerce fuseswellwith sports, culture, and art—fieldsofproductionwhereineconomic in terestisconstantly denied (Bourdieu 1994). Thistestimonyinthefusionofculture and commerce isevidentintheconceptual narrativeused in Fort Bonifacio Global City’swebsite. Invokingthevaluesofart in the urban setting, the textcogentlyasserts: Aestheticvalues, modern architecture, green and cool surroundings, gloriousfood, boundless excitement, soul-liftingartsand culture— allconverge in the Global City, in an abundance that nurturesand enrichesthe qualifyof life.

Apart from these, the City willserve as a culturalhub. Culture will evolve as itdoes in any commercial gateway, with the establishment of galleries, concert halls, museums and cultural centers (http:// www. fort-bonifacio. com/in dex. html). The globalizingforcesdominating citieshave dissolvedthe notion of a localand “pure”culturalidentityasthejuxtapositionofthe differenceofculturesgiveway to dispersedheterogeneity.

Standingauthoritativelyagainsttheskylinesof Manila, the irbuildings falldominantly under the mixed-use development (MXD) category, which is reflectiveof thiscentrifugalmovement or self-centricspatialprogramming of activitieswithintheconfinesof the city. MXD subscribesto the principlesof New Urbanism, preachedgloballyby Miami-based architectsand town planners Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. New Urbanism istrumpeted locallyby Felino Palafox Jr., Rockwell Center’smaster planner on record (with SOM as design consultant), as a planning alternativeto eradicate automobile-dependent communities and transform them into traditionalurban models of the neighborhood, a placewhere living, working, shopping, and alltheotheraspects of lifeexistwithinwalkingdistanceof eachother—allconforming to the geography of centrality, protectionism, and in troversion. A mixed-used development, as in the case of Rockwell Center, ishailedby itsmaster planneras “an ideal, master planned mixed-use development that in corporatesthe elements of sustainable livinginone place”(Lico 1999 a, 73). Here human activitiesareframed in ward as itoffersa balanced blend of dwellings, workplaces, shops, civicbuildings, ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 547 recreationalfacilities, and landscaped open spaces (the proximityof activities reduces the number and lengthof vehiculartrips), and pedestrianizedstreet networks that discourage motorized movement (structuresare in dependently accessiblewithout any singularrelianceon cars). Walking isfurtherencouraged by making the tree-linedstreetsnotjustmere routesbut destinationsthemselves, and devoting more publicopen spaces which willserveas focalpointsfor all structuresand sub-blocks. The basicprincipleofthis cityisthatitcan standalone, in tentionallydivorcingitselffrom allforms of urban derelictionexistingbeyond its margin. Fort Bonifacio The “Global City”of Bonifaciopresentsseveraldimensions. First, for mer President Ramos had underscoredtheprincipalsignificanceof“Bonifacio’ssymbolicnational roleindemonstratingtotheworld the Filipino’sabilityto carryout projectsofthis magnitude” (Lico 1999 b, 109). The Fort Bonifacio Development Corporationhas prescribedthe specificauspiciousattributesthatmake up the globalcity, allof which are of “in ternationalstandards of creativityand execution”(Ibid.). This constitutesadvanced technologicalcapabilitiesleadingto an “in telligentcity,” provisionsforverdantopen spaces, and a competent in tegratedtransportation system, allof which are designed to at tractand servethe largerinternational community. Bonifacio City aims to achieve a unique, sensuous, and multidimensionalenvironment that must functionwithindemanding financial parameters, thus, in vokingthe need to triumph as a commercial venture. These. conceptions of a “Global City”can be construed as an in ternationalshowcase, sanctionedas a symboliccarrierofnationaldevelopment aspirationswithinthe larger“globalvillage.” In 1995, at the outsetof Bonifacio Global City’smaster planning, the 440-hectare for mer militaryforthad been the focusofintense in ternationalinterest, prompting the media to hailitas “the deal of the century.”With a bid of US$1.6 B Bonifacio Land Corporationwon the bidbased on the plans of RTKLand PROS. The proposal was to acquirea fifty-fivepercentshare,214 hectaresofthe property, to develop what the yenvisionto be Southeast Asia’sbestcity. Canonized as the “nucleusof Philippineprogressinthetwenty-firstcentury,”Fort Bonifacio Cityisdestinedto be the model for futuredevelopments. The contiguous 440-hectare Bonifaciopropertyisbounded by threeroad arteries: the South Luzon Expressway, EDSA, and C-5. Itsdistanceofone to fourkilometers from Manila’sother businesscenters—Ortigasand Makati—and, likewise, its adjacencytolow-densityresidentialenclaves—Forbes Parkand Dasmarifias Village— areproofofitsreal-estatevalue.

The developerassertsthatthemasterplan’s synthesisofinternationalconventions Ischaracteristically Filipino. The “Filipino— ness”of the masterplanaswellasitscosmopolitanmixiscursorilyrationalizedby citingthe parallelismthatexistsbetween Filipinocultureand Bonifacio’surban design: both havingevolvedfrom a mixtureofassimilatedforeigninfluences. The morphology of Bonifacio’scitypatternsprungfrom a consolidationofphysical and conceptualinputs, yieldinga finalgeometry thatinterweaves:(1)an or ganic framework (whichadapts to the to pography of the landbut leadsto lessefficient landuses);(2)a gridironpattern(whichcreatesan efficientlandutilizationscheme but resultsina static, predictable, and boringcitypattern); and, (3) a radial/ concentricpattern(whichgivesfocalelements, images, and identity, but resultsin in efficientland use and problematicroad networks). The explorationsforthe ideal cityform for Bonifacio culminated by bestowing the scheme with morphological and conceptual continuityachievedthrough the fusionof the advantageouselementsofgrid, geometric, and or ganiccitypatterns, with primary North-Southand secondary East-Westceremonialaxesand a green, circular“heart” of the cityatthecenterofthe plan. The city’splangridwas establishedby passingthecenterlineof Bonifacio Boulevard through the centerof an existingtrafficrotunda frontingthe American Battle ARCHITECTURE OF PLURALISM 549 Memorial. The Bonifacio Boulevard’saxiswas then rotatedto N 18.5 degrees E. The NE-SW citystreetorientationcreatesa climaticallyadapted and feng shui- responsivedesign. The gridconvergesatthe Central Commons. The established gridisthen overlaidwith the geometry of fourconcentriccirclesand a singular form, which stretchesfrom Mc Kinley Road to the in stitutionalareas. On the other hand, the framework for“The Villages,”a low-densityresidentialenclavelocated at the southwestof the Bonifacio Cityproper, combines curvilinearparkways with dual, geometric-patternedvillages, each with a perpendicular, central, greenaxis. To neutralizethe impression of a well-contrivedurban environment, zoning allocationwas designed to ensure the heterogeneityof a cityand conjure an illusionofa citybred by communal collectivism. Heterogeneitycharacterizesgreat cities; the yarean agglomerationofdistrictswith physicallydistinctidentities. The complex fusionofpragmaticand aestheticconsiderations, which form the essence of Bonifacio City, isstreamlinedintodistrictsthatstipulatethedesiredcitystructure and in dividualneighborhood and architecturalcharacteralongwith the irspecial featuresand landmarks.

Each district, while carryingspecificneighborhood characterand elements, isintelligentlywoven by such a scheme in to what the designerconceivesas a specialand memorable urban tapestry. The patchworkofdifferentiateddistrictsiswoven to getherbya rich, dignified, and layeredsystem of open spaces, which provideecologicallyviablefocalpointsfor each neighborhood and connectionsbetween neighborhoods. In Bonifacio, open spaces assume the form of community parks, neighborhood parks, perimeter greenways, plazas, and waterfeatures. The landscaped environmentsdispensean opportunityforshowcasing Philippinefloraand horticulture(for in stance, the arched tree-tunnelalameda of Mc Kinley Road renders a superb front door approach to Bonifacio)and a venue for exhibitingpublicartand sculpture.

These arejustsome of the conscientiousdetailstakenintoaccount, at testingto Bonifacio’scommitment to not leavingany designcomponent, however small, to chance. Bonifacio Global City, as itpositionsitselfglobally, has resortedto trans- nationalizingarchitecturalimagery, planning, and design services. This is accomplished through the utilizationof for eigndesignconsultantsteaming up with the irlocalcounterpartwhileprovidingcontextualmodificationofimported Western architecturalframeworks to assureitsacceptance in the globalmarket. Now, the globalcityisin the firstof four phases of implementation, with the creationof“The Fort”retailand entertainmentcenterand the on going construction of several high-rises, in cluding Essensa East Forbes, Pacific Plaza Towers, and One Mc Kinley Place, at the 57.2-hectare Big Deltaarea. These structuresand facilities of globalcaliberprovidea previewof what Bonifacio Citycan of ferto itsfuture denizens. There aremany aestheticand pragmaticaspectsofthe Fort Bonifaciodevelopment thatareworth ment ioning. Assuming a socioculturalperspective, however, itis in deeda citythat triesto eliminate Manila’s urban pathologies; but, several questionscome to mind: Initsaim to projecta globalimage, will Bonifacio City at tempt to shun the encounter of povertyand luxuryand of socialjusticeand privatization?

Itispossibleto perceive Fort Bonifacio, Rockwell, and Eastwood Citiesas a cautionarytextof on going changes in the relationshipof propertydevelopment and aesthetics. Thus, we demystifythelogicoftheir ideologiesand resoundthesilencesintheirarchitectural text.

Moreover, how the yhave projectedthemselvesas rescuers of publicspace whilemasking the designmaneuvers for publiccontroland social polarizationshallalsobe discussed. The myth of localhero cannot be missed out in the Fort Bonifacio Global City’s poeticdevelopment credo: The Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation believes that land is not in herited from our for efathers.

There isat the outset an unease caused by the title. The main phrase speaks of “Arkitekturang Filipino,”an expansive territorythat is rescaled as “Architecture and Urbanism in the Philippines.”First, the scene of the vernacular, an in stance of an irreducibleparticular; then, the translationinto English, an at tempt to reckon architecturecross-culturally. A tension stirsbetween an identityof architecture that isnamed Filipinoand the locus of practice that isthe Philippines, wavering between gestures of nomination and emplacement. Itisa strainthat isproductive, and in fact may shape the very travailof writing about art and itslocale, its universe. This isintended to be a textbook for students of architecturewho must learn to appreciate the lineage of the irvocation. But itis more than just a catalogue of factsand figures; itis a compelling scheme that charts the directionof the study of architecture in the Philippines. With copious photographs and _ archival materialssorted out and analyzed in relationto ideas and propositions, thisbook turns out to be avitalcontribution to our understanding of the abode of a most in habited art. Indeed, with a sense of breadth and at tention to the detailsof terrain, a horizon‘has been decidedly set. - Patrick D.

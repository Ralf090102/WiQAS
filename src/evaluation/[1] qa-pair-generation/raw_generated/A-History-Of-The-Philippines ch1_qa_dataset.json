This document is issued in case there is someone, whosoever, some time in the future who will state that the debt is not yet acquitted of His Honor …” —The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, translated by Antoon Postma, quoted in E. P. Patanñe, The Philippines in the Sixth to the Sixteenth Centuries T HE FULL STORY BEHIND THE L AGUNA C OPPERPLATE I NSCRIPTION (LCI) may never be known. Discovered in 1989 buried in a riverbank in Laguna Province, south of Manila, the LCI was drawn up in 900 C. E., the equivalent of the Sanskrit calendar date in scribed on it—more than five hundred years before the barangay (village or settlement) of Maynila turned into a Muslim community, and more than six centuries before the Europeans first learned of the archipelago’s existence. The in scription—the oldest known document of pre-Hispanic times in the Philippine archipelago—is vital to understanding how people in the islands, at least in certain parts, lived and what kind of society or societies they might have constructed. The LCI writing bears remarkable similarities to the ancient Kawi script of Indonesia. Analyses by experts in both ancient Philippine and Indonesian scripts reveal a language that contained not only Sanskrit but also old Javanese, old Malay, and old Tagalog words. It antedates baybayin, the native script in use when the Spanish came calling in the sixteenth century, one that, with variations in alphabet according to the region, essentially consisted of twenty letters. The LCI script, no longer extant, lingered on in the baybayin’s for mative in fluences such as Sanskrit and Arabic. With the advent of the Spanish, and the in tervention primarily of the friars, the Castilian alphabet replaced the native scripts, but those communities in the in terior that managed to steer clear of Spanish rule and the new faith kept their old systems of writing. A form of baybayin can still be seen, for in stance, in the script of the Hanunoo Mangyan of Mindoro Island, off the southwestern coast of Luzon, a tribe that continues to in scribe on bamboo a form of its poetry known as the ambahan, with seven-syllable lines meant primarily to be chanted. The copperplate ment ions place names that still exist in latter-day Bulacan, a province abutting the northern edge of Tondo, another ancient settlement that faced Maynila across the Pasig River delta. More significantly, it persuasively at tests to the Hindu in fluence of the Sumatra-based Srivijaya empire, which had spread beyond the central part of the Philippine archipelago—and to which the colonists had affixed the name “Visayas”—to the strategically located barangays of Tondo and Maynila, where the river empties out onto a magnificent bay and the South China Sea. Through the two barangays, which would have controlled river traffic, some form of Hindu in fluence would have spread to other areas in Luzon where the Tagalogs (the principal tribe of Tondo and Maynila) were also dominant. Indeed, modern-day Tagalog possesses words that are Sanskrit in or igin: budhi (conscience), mukha (face), guro (teacher), tala (star), dukha (needy), diwata (muse, goddess), among them. Perhaps most tellingly, the LCI in dicates the crucial role that slavery played in barangay pre-colonial life. Lady Angkatan, Bukah, son of Namwran, and members of their immediate family were almost certainly debt slaves, and this document would have given them a tremendous sense of relief. We will never know whether Lady Angkatan was Namwran’s widow, aunt, mother, or sister; nor what the Honorable Namwran did to acquit the family of this debt. Had he distinguished himself in battle, giving up his life for the sake of his chief? Or was it Bukah who bore arms bravely? It seems clear that this was a seemingly well-born family that through misfortune or Namwran’s misguided business dealings found itself unable to pay back a substantial loan. Now, they could hold their heads high once more. In a sense, they were for tunate to have been in debted to the paramount chief of their clan. It would have been worse had they been abducted by their clan enemies or by tattooed raiders from the Visayas, the cluster of islands in the archipelago’s center, whom the Spanish called pintados, or painted ones. The number and in tricacy of a Visayan warrior’s tattoos signaled to friend and foe alike his strength and abilities as a warrior. More than land or goods, slaves were a sure sign of one’s wealth and status, especially slaves captured in raiding parties on other barangays. As war booty, not only were they tangible proof of a datu’s leadership and martial prowess (more so than homegrown, as it were, slaves), they were more likely to be treated as disposable property, sometimes put to death when the master moved on to the next world. Another basis of slavery was as punishment for crimes. These in cluded bearing false witness against someone; the transgression of taboo customs, such as, according to the sixteenth-century account of the Jesuit Pedro Chirino, “failure to preserve silence for the dead” or “happening to pass in front of a chief who was bathing”; murder; adultery; or failing to do one’s duty (during war, for in stance) when the chief, or datu, asked for it. Such crimes could be for given if the transgressor could pay the proper fee of goods or gold to the aggrieved party. Colonial rule under the Spanish, which lasted for 333 years, from 1565 to 1898, eliminated certain aspects of barangay life, such as slavery, though modern-day critics might assert that slavery persists in disguised forms in to day’s highly in equitable society; in troduced Christianity and Western concepts such as bureaucratic state rule and private property; and modified, if not strengthened, some features of pre-colonial ways of living, e. g., the melding of the private and public spheres of life"

In the archipelago, the Iberians had come upon different societies, at once static and dynamic, with well-defined frameworks within which the world made sense. To the Spanish, of course, in fected with an overbearing sense of racial superiority and entitlement, the native way of life was savage and the refore had to be supplanted with the European notion of civilization. The conquistador Miguel de Legazpi, who led the 1565 expedition that successfully brought most of the islands under the dominion of the Spanish Crown, after grudgingly noting that the island men treated and loved their wives well, summed up rather succinctly what he and most of his compatriots really thought: “They are all barbarians and have no manners or politeness.” What kind of archipelagic societies did the Spanish first encounter? What were the various island communities like before the advent of the West? How did the pre-Hispanic Filipinos relate to the rest of Southeast Asia? To draw a portrait, which must of necessity be for ever in complete since history is a never- ending process of revisions and counter-revisions, one needs to begin with geography, for geography helps shape destiny. It is a major element in determining how history and hierarchy in the islands evolved. The archipelago known to day as the Republic of the Philippines lies on the northeastern rim of Southeast Asia, a necklace of 7,107 isles strung from north to south over 1,152 miles, situated between the vast and mighty Pacific Ocean to the east and the gentler, lesser South China Sea to the west. The islands cover a to tal area of 115,831 square miles, roughly the same size as Italy. Only 2,773 of the islands bear names, with elongated Luzon in the north the largest, and Mindanao to the south the next in size. These two islands constitute two-thirds of the country’s land mass. Between them are the Visayan Islands, consisting mainly of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Negros, Bohol, and Panay. The western edge of the country is taken up by the mini-archipelago of Palawan Province, made up of the island of Palawan and 1,700 satellite isles. This semi-tropical island chain has only two—but very distinct—seasons: dry and wet. The northern and eastern regions lie within the typhoon belt: areas directly affected by storms that come raging out of the Pacific during the latter half of the year. On the average, typhoons maul the eastern Visayas and Luzon twenty times annually, at one time prompting a frustrated lawmaker to propose a bill outlawing them. In the Cordilleras of Northern Luzon the weather can be downright chilly, when winds from as far north as Siberia, along with migratory birds, travel south. With the typhoons breaking against the eastern flanks of mountain ranges, there is less of a pronounced dry season on the Pacific side. Hence, more people and businesses reside in the western part of the country, rendering the west more in dustrialized and economically developed. Island geography owes much of its ruggedness to being part of the Pacific Rim of Fire, a line of volcanic for mations that extend, in the northern hemisphere, from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The Philippines contains thirty-seven volcanoes, the majority thankfully dormant, though one volcano blowing its top is always a reminder that others could follow suit. Such was the case with Mt. Pinatubo which, six hundred years after its last awakening, erupted in 1991 with such ferocity over five days that gaseous plumes ascended to as high up as twenty-four miles and spewed out seven cubic kilometers of ash and rock—the worst such eruption in the country’s history and possibly of the twentieth century. On the other hand, volcanic deposits are one reason the land is fertile, generating life where once it buried it. East of the archipelago, off the coast of northeastern Luzon south to Halmahera Island in Indonesia, the Philippine Deep, also known as the Mindanao Trench, stretches for close to a thousand miles, measuring roughly nineteen miles across. At its deepest it extends 34,850 feet below sea level— deeper than Mt. Everest is tall. The Philippine Deep rests on the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, which constantly shift and grind against each other. As an entity that gained political in dependence only in 1946, the nation is quite young, a little more than six decades old. Geologically, however, it is a different story. Large swaths of Luzon and Mindanao are more than 25 million years old, while the age of the rest of the country varies, from 100,000 to 10 million years old. During the late Pleistocene era, some islands were linked to the Asian mainland; among these were Palawan, Mindoro, and Panay. Palawan, having once been part of Borneo, has flora and fauna not found in the rest of the country. Evolution and the for mation of a rather isolated archipelago has resulted in an astonishing biodiversity over a landmass of 30 million hectares, or 66 million acres, with a number of endemic species, e. g., 70 percent of its reptiles and 44 percent of its avian creatures are not to be found anywhere else. However, the rate of population growth is quite high. In 2008, with a population of 90 million, it was 2 percent a year, in large part due to an exceedingly in fluential and conservative Catholic hierarchy that rails against government-sponsored family planning. (In contrast, the 2008 rate for the United States was less than 1 percent.) This, along with a depressed economy, has resulted, perhaps most critically, in an environment continually under siege"

Many species have a tenuous hold on life, as they require primary-for est habitats. Such is the case with the Philippine Eagle, more popularly known as the monkey-eating eagle—a large and magnificent avian predator with a wingspan of nearly seven feet. A pair needs approximately twenty-five to fifty square miles of for est to sustain the mselves and to propagate. A S W E W ERE: P RE -C OLONIAL B ARANGAY S OCIETY It was long held as common wisdom that populations in the archipelago were the result of migrations that took place in neat, successive waves, between 30,000 B. C. E. and 200 B. C. E.—the last wave composed of Malays from the south who had more advanced forms of metallurgy and crafts, such as the weaving of cloth and the manufacture of glass or naments. This the ory’s biggest proponent was the late American anthropologist H. Otley Beyer, at one time head of the anthropology department at the University of the Philippines, who based his conclusions on pioneering fieldwork done from the 1920 s to the early 1940 s. While the artifacts recovered from the field were in deed valuable, his the ory has since fallen out of favor. According to linguists, various languages were already being spoken throughout the archipelago thousands of years ago. Too, archaeological evidence reveals that trade was flourishing in the region in the first millennium B. C. E., probably even earlier—both pointing to the fact that groups of people of different or igins came and stayed or went, sometimes in larger numbers, sometimes in smaller, but never so methodically as envisioned in Beyer’s grand the ory. There seem to have been at least two discrete movements of people that, over time, dispersed through in sular Southeast Asia: the Australoids, characterized by dark pigmentation, and the Austronesians, or brown-skinned peoples, who started to arrive about six millennia ago, from the south via Borneo and Indonesia, and the north from southern China and Taiwan. Later migrations in cluded people from Champa, a Hinduized kingdom of seafarers and traders in southern and central Vietnam that flourished from the seventh century to the fifteenth century C. E. It wasn’t just one way, apparently. The eminent archaeologist Wilhelm G. Solheim II adds another layer to this diffusion when he suggests that the cultures of the natives of Southeast Asia, whom he calls Nusantao, and their descendants, had their beginnings in, or at the very least were in fluenced by, maritime- or iented tribes of in sular Southeast Asia, dating to 5000 B. C. E. or even earlier. Islanders came and went, as did the coastal dwellers of mainland eastern Asia, the twain meeting—and mating—repeatedly over the course of millennia. According to Solheim, long-distance seafaring vessels known as balangay and outfitted with in novative bamboo outriggers may have been devised about 4000 B. C. E., in itiating major outmigrations by water. The buoyant outriggers helped balance the shallow-draft vessel while at the same time enabling it to navigate smoothly and speedily over the water—a feature remarked upon in later accounts of European navigators used to bulkier and slower ships. The larger ones, equipped with sails, could be used in war as well, with rowers on each side. These war vessels, known variously as karakoas and prahus, had platforms above the outriggers upon which as many as a hundred warriors could stand. By the third millennium B. C. E., these migrations had resulted in settlements in both the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. By the second millennium B. C. E., they had gone as far west as Madagascar, off the eastern coast of Africa. Human settlements known as barangays, after the outriggered boats, were thus firmly in place in the Philippines well before the Spanish arrived, with a number of larger barangays trading with for eign ships that plied Southeast Asian waters. While archaeological evidence at tests to human presence in the archipelago as far back as 250,000 years ago, the earliest known human settlements were in caves on the southern reaches of long, dagger-shaped Palawan Island. Evidence suggests that the caves were continuously in habited from 50,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene Age, until 9,000 B. C. E.—one vanguard of the seafaring peoples who for med the main matrix of contemporary populations. Known as the Tabon Caves and set into ocean-facing cliffs, they would have afforded a clear view of waterborne visitors and provided easy access to the waters the mselves. Possibly the oldest Homo sapiens fossil in Southeast Asia, nicknamed the Tabon Man, was unearthed here, carbon-dated to 47,000 years ago. But the Tabon Man was more than one in dividual, the finds in cluding a skullcap, jawbones, teeth, and bone fragments, with one tibia being the oldest fossil. The Tabon Man appears to have had Negritoid characteristics— strengthening the argument that the islands were or iginally in habited by the Australoids, ancestors of the modern-day Negritos, otherwise known as the Agta, Aeta, or Ati. Food gatherers and hunters, the Tabon men and women, devising necessary strategies of survival, progressed from basic flake to ols to in struments such as adzes and axes. Like the Tabon Cave dwellers, most of the islanders lived by or close to water, whether ocean, river, or lake—sources of abundant food. Water was obviously the only transportation route to other islands, and these dwellers by the water engaged in brisk trade not just with nearby isles, but with ports as disparate as those on the southern coast of China and the Straits of Malacca"

Water was obviously the only transportation route to other islands, and these dwellers by the water engaged in brisk trade not just with nearby isles, but with ports as disparate as those on the southern coast of China and the Straits of Malacca. Larger population centers sprung up due to trade and, in some areas, most notably in Mindanao, the in sistent call of Islam. But there were no fiercely ambitious warlords, no Tokugawa or Genghis Khan, who set out to unify many fiefdoms. Until the Spanish appeared on the horizon, no nation-state existed, only a far-flung collection of islands untroubled by the notion of a center. Trade The archipelago for med the outer edges of an established trade circle, one that extended from the Persian Gulf in the Middle East to Southern China, thus encompassing Southeast Asia. It was at its most active from the seventh to the ninth century C. E., and antedated European in vasion in the sixteenth century. Chinese records from 671 contain references to Persian ships. Later accounts, in cluding Japanese ones, ment ion not just the Persians but Indians and Malays as well, all trading at Canton. By 851, this trade route was well-established, with ships making calls at India’s Malabar Coast, the Nicobar Islands, the Malay Peninsula, passing through the Straits of Malacca, with more calls at Cambodia and Vietnam, before heading to Canton. According to historian Janet Abu- Lughod, in her book Before European Hegemony, “The easternmost circuit was Chinese ‘space,’ the sea that joined the east coast of Indochina and the northern shore of Java with the great ports of South China being under the hegemony of the Sung and Yuan navies. This … was the domain par excellence of what scholars have called the tribute trade.” Of the pre-colonial Philippine ports that for med part of this trading world, Butuan was one of the most active, probably the center of trade and commerce in the islands during the eleventh century. Situated on the northwestern coast of Mindanao by the Agusan River, Butuan was a putative city-state by October 1003, the first pre-Hispanic Philippine barangay known to for mally deal with Imperial China when it sent two envoys by the names of Lihiyan and Jiaminan (the names suggest Sinicization) to Beijing, to recognize the Divine Son of Heaven as undisputed sovereign, and, not coincidentally, to petition for the right to trade. The Butuan traders likely would have brought tropical hardwoods, beeswax, cinnamon, civet cats, cowry shells, abaca, and gold. Some of these would have been gifts for the royal court. Butuan also traded with the kingdom of Champa. Between 900 and 1200 C. E., in addition to Butuan, the Champa established trading outposts in Sulu. By the fifteenth century, 400 to 500 junks from Cambodia, Champa, and southern China were visiting the islands annually. Yet, while situated strategically between the Persian Gulf and China, thus ensuing their value as transit points, Southeast Asian pre-colonial entrepots were not the region’s dominant players. They acted mostly as sources for raw materials, or as transshipment centers, of which the most valuable was the port of Malacca. (Malacca was also a major slave market, where slave raiders brought their human cargo, abducted from various coastal to wns in Southeast Asia, to be sold to customers as varied as merchants looking for laborers and ship captains wanting to supplement their crews.) It had four harbormasters for ships or iginating from as near as Sumatra and Java, as far west as Persia, and as far north as the Ryu Kyu Islands and China. Commercial traffic along the Straits of Malacca thus helped shape the burgeoning global trade, especially during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. According to William Henry Scott, in Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society, “It was in Malacca that Europeans”— specifically, the Portuguese—“first met Filipinos,” a decade before the Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan came across the archipelago in 1521. These pre-Hispanic Filipinos were called “Luzones,” from the island whence they had come. The Luzones were known not only as merchants and traders but also as fierce mercenaries active in various military campaigns in the region, employed, for in stance, by the Achenese and the Burmese kings, or crewing on pirate ships. West of Malacca, on the coast, was a community of 500 Tagalogs, while in Malacca itself, according to Scott, “they had their own shops and in cluded a number of prominent businessmen.” The Portuguese took over Malacca in 1511, with Magellan as part of the conquering force. It was in Malacca that he purchased a young Malay slave he had christened Enrique, who would prove to be an in valuable asset when, ten years later, the Spanish exploratory fleet Magellan headed came across the islands later to be called the Philippines. It is the refore not unreasonable to assume that even before 1521, Magellan and the Portuguese knew of the Philippine archipelago, east and northeast of the Malay Peninsula. The region was rich in natural resources, from minerals to spices to for est and maritime products, and this, coupled with rising demand from countries outside the region, ensured an almost perfect fit among supplier, manufacturer, and consumer. In short, as Abu-Lughod points out, Malacca was ideally located as a comprador site, just as Hong Kong and Singapore are now. In this trade world, the Chinese were active, if not dominant, players. At one time the Middle Kingdom commanded an enormous fleet—the so-called Treasure Fleet, under the command of a seven-foot-tall eunuch, Cheng Ho.

On its in itial voyage in 1405, the fleet was made up of 27,800 men and 1,500 vessels, dwarfing any of the European fleets then. The Chinese had as their sole aim for ging trade relations with their Asian neighbors. On several voyages, the Chinese fleet sailed to Africa and the Persian Gulf, and points between, setting up a trading network that built on previous outposts. Unlike the European expansionists later on, the Middle Kingdom had no imperialist ambitions, disdaining to rule over the non- Chinese, whom they dismissed as barbarians—except for the Koreans, the Japanese, and the Annamese. The dynamics of this trade system underwent a drastic change, however, when the Chinese shut down their ports to for eign ships, essentially abandoning their trading network and mothballing the kingdom’s powerful navy in the fifteenth century, during the Ming Dynasty. Until then, no one nation had at tempted to dominate the Asian trade. The sealanes were remarkably free, for the most part, from armed conflict and thus relatively peaceful. The with drawal of China’s powerful fleets resulted in a vacuum the Portuguese gladly filled in the early sixteenth century. The Portuguese and, later, other European powers, were thus accidental beneficiaries of the Middle Kingdom’s hermetic move. By the mid sixteenth century Spanish and Portuguese galleons and warships, along with pirates (who still plague the Straits to day), prowled the shipping lanes with out any challenge from the Chinese navy. Transactions with the Philippine archipelago, while profitable, did not constitute major business for for eign traders, as the islands were on the eastern edge of the trade routes. But in ternational commerce was extensive enough to generate a vital in ter-island trade that relied as much on for eign goods coming in —from, for in stance, China, Borneo, and Champa—as on local products. From China came porcelain, finished silk, musk, stoneware, in cense, artillery, and tin. Brass, steel blades, and woven mats were brought from Borneo, batik from Java, and precious stones from countries such as Burma. In exchange, for eign traders could purchase in a transshipping port like Cebu—smack in the middle of the archipelago—such items as pearls, beeswax, to rtoise shell, animal skins, cotton, and civet cats. The coastal dwellers traded as well with the hunter/gatherers who lived in the in terior and in the highlands, bartering, for in stance, salt for honey, and cloth for beeswax—for est products that could be retailed to for eign traders. (At times, lowlander and highlander were at each other’s throats, but never so habitually or bitterly as to prevent trading.) That water played a central role in the lives of the islanders can be further gleaned from the names of both places and tribes. For in stance, Mindanao has its etymological roots in danao, referring to a body of water. The same is true of Lanao, Maranao, and Maguindanao. Tausug, the name of the major ethnic tribe in the Sulu archipelago, means “people of the current,” with “Tau” a variant of “tao” or person. Tagalog, the name of the ethnic group predominant in Central Luzon and parts of Southern Luzon, means literally “from the river,” or Taga-ilog. And the city of Manila, located in the Tagalog region, is a shortened form of the or iginal Maynila, “place of water lilies.” Similar aquatic correlations at tend other place names, such as the province of Pampanga (“site of river banks”) in Luzon and, in Mindanao, the Agusan River, with “agusan” meaning “where the water flows,” rendering the English name linguistically redundant. Whether coastal, riverine, or hinterland, the different communities developed ways of living that—in fluenced by fertile soil, in frequent harsh weather, and a uniform ecology—were quite similar. As the Philippine historian Onofre D. Corpuz observed, “The generally benign tropical climate and the largely uniform flora and fauna favored similarities, not differences.” However, reflecting island geography, pre-colonial Philippine society was not an unbroken, homogenous entity. It is the refore more accurate to speak of “societies,” though there were enough similarities among these to in dicate common or igins and an archipelago- wide in teraction, from north to south, from west to east. Interestingly, according to William Henry Scott in Barangay, the similarities “also suggest that lowland Filipinos in the sixteenth century had more in common with highland minorities in the twentieth than with their own Christian descendants”—an in dication of how the in tervening centuries of Christian colonization of the lowlanders widened the heretofore in consequential gap between them and the highlanders. Hierarchy Native societies, as the Spanish found them, were, like Caesar’s Gaul, divided into three parts: the ruling elite, their peers and followers, and slaves. (It must be kept in mind that most descriptions and judgments of a pre-colonial Philippines are mainly derived from Spanish accounts, with all that that implies in terms of a priori notions stemming from the observers’ own Christian and European backgrounds.) The social structures that existed in both the Visayas and Luzon were remarkably similar, consisting of the datus and the maginoo at the top, the timawa and maharlika in the middle, and, occupying the bottom rungs, the alipin. The smallest politico-social unit was the barangay, which, as has been noted, or iginally referred to the seagoing vessel on which a family or clan traveled. Usage of the term for land-based settlements in dicated that the settlers favored a location by a body of water, be it river, lake, or ocean. Most barangays were small, consisting of only thirty to one hundred houses, with from one hundred to five hundred persons. Off the trade routes but still on the coast were even smaller settlements, probably no more than eight to ten houses. Still, there were some giant barangays"

Off the trade routes but still on the coast were even smaller settlements, probably no more than eight to ten houses. Still, there were some giant barangays. Maynila, for in stance, had two thousand in habitants at the time of Spanish conquest, while Cebu and the sultanates in Sulu and Mindanao were comparable in size, if not larger. But these bigger barangays were the exceptions rather than the rule. A datu headed the barangay, with each barangay more or less self-contained, though there were occasionally alliances among various barangays. There were no for mal allegiances beyond the barangay, except in the Muslim settlements to the south. Relations within the barangay were largely in fluenced by kinship ties on both parents’ sides and by economic status. Members of the or iginal barangay, having traveled on the same boat, would have been part of the same clan. Blood ties were thus of the utmost importance, for they guaranteed fealty to the barangay. Alliances between two chiefs of different barangays would of ten be sealed through a blood compact, where each would drink wine mingled with the other’s blood—or suck the blood directly from a cut made on the arm of the other. Simulating blood ties, the rite was called sandugo (or “one blood”). To the Spanish, this barangay ritual must have been an eerie reminder of the Eucharist, the Christian sacrament based on a belief in transubstantion, the conversion of bread and wine into Christ’s body and blood, communicants becoming one with the Divine, one reason that the Spanish may have taken readily to this ritual. Hence, the barangay was essentially an extended family, a gathering of a particular clan. Well into the mid-eighteenth century, with the Spanish long entrenched, people for ced to resettle into new to wns (due to the colonial policy known as reducción ) still referred to the mselves as kabangka —from the “same boat,” bangka being another word for boat. One’s position within the barangay was affected less by birthright (though the position of datu could be in herited) than by acknowledged prowess both in leadership and in providing for the survival of the barangay—roughly identical to one’s worth in keeping the boat shipshape. There were then no claims to a divine imprimatur or special access to the heavens, no boasts about having a hotline to God. In any case, such claims to otherworldly connections would have been the province of the local shaman and seer, the katolonan in the Tagalog regions, and babaylan in the Visayas, who could be male (even a cross-dressing one) or female but was more of ten than not the latter. Since the barangay was not a political state as we know it, the datu could be more properly thought of as the head of a social unit, the paterfamilias, if you will. Consequently, a datu’s authority rested as much on his abilities in combat, especially raids that resulted in the capture of slaves, as on his wealth, the strength and depth of his followers, and his lineage. Thus, a datu could be oppressive or generous, broad-minded or narrow in outlook in the way he governed and adjudicated disputes within the barangay. He was expected to be his followers’ champion in battle. (With the Tagalogs, the class to which the datu belonged was that of the maginoo, or his peers, a term that could refer to either sex.) Members of a barangay reciprocated by contributing labor, such as helping to harvest his crops, and paying tribute for his household’s maintenance. The datu’s followers were the freemen, either the timawa or the maharlika — the distinction being made on the basis of service rendered to the datu. The timawa rendered the irs primarily in non-military ways, though they could bear arms if they so desired. The maharlika, on the other hand, functioned roughly as knights did for a king. To think of these freemen as commoners would be misleading, however. In a self-contained society that was the barangay, the timawa and the maharlika had a close relationship with the datu, albeit in varying degrees. In essence, they made up his court: close by at his feasts, alongside him in battle, whether on the field or in a ship, acting as his emissaries, etc. Since a settlement and its social structure arose out of barangay conditions, relations among the three groups were more fluid than can be accommodated by the idea of “class,” though there were societal divisions of labor, to be sure. But even such hierarchical relations could be and were of ten radically altered. A datu could be deposed, a maharlika reduced to dependence, and a debt-slave become free if he or she paid off his/her debts—or if, as in the case of the for tunate Namwran, those debts were for given. The barangay social or der being an extension of the family, the notion of private ownership of land was irrelevant. It made no sense to claim particular tracts permanently, given there was so much land available. Hence, in dividuals would not have thought of acquiring land, though they had the right of usufruct if they had cultivated a particular parcel. Every member of the barangay was a shareholder the or etically and could derive profit from land use. The datu, however, representing the apex of communal society, was in strumental in determining how such lands would be used. One could thus utilize the land but not hold title to it—the idea of “title,” of course, not coming into play. With fixed-site agriculture and fishing primarily for livelihood, barangay economies were tailored mostly to meet the barangay’s needs, and for possible barter with other barangays. As in any family or clan, the stress was on shared labor, whether this was in farming, say, or house building.

The practice of bayanihan (literally, communal solidarity) in to day’s evolving, not to ment ion disappearing, rural society can be traced to this tradition of shared labor. Producers owned their means of production, and any surplus from a bountiful harvest was stored against a rainy day or for barter, rather than for purely speculative purposes. In a word, the archipelagic barangay was not only pre-colonial but also pre-capitalist. Probably the most spectacular and awe-in spiring in stance of enduring bayanihan are the rice terraces of Northern Luzon, high up in the Cordillera Mountain Range. In continuous use since they were built two millennia ago by the Ifugao (one of several tribes based in the Cordilleras), these magnificent embankments were carved out of stubborn and treacherous mountainsides. Organizing the labor, building up the paddies, and devising the placement of rocks and irrigation canals were daunting challenges that required a tight, cohesive, and efficient social structure. Made up of kinship ties, the barangay did not constitute a system in dependent from its in habitants—it had no existence as a legal fiction, unlike a modern-day to wnship. Thus, a barangay had no public buildings for government or community affairs, no castles or town halls. The datu’s residence would have been the largest building and the center of the barangay. The idea of what passed for “public” was really the private world writ larger. (However, the highlander tribes in Northern Luzon, or Igorot, as they are collectively known, had and still have what is known as the dap-ay, an open-air community space, like a table in the round, where the elders gather to discuss pressing issues.) Nonetheless, some barangays developed supra-barangay affinities, such as the Muslim sultanates. The earliest one, the Sultanate of Sulu, established in the fifteenth century, a century before the advent of the Spanish, arose in Jolo in the Sulu archipelago, southwest of Mindanao and in close proximity to Borneo and the Indonesian archipelago. The second, later sultanate emerged in Maguindanao, with tradition holding that a certain Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuwan moved north to Mindanao from Malacca, after the Portuguese took over that port city in 1511. Three other large barangays were the aforementioned Butuan in northwestern Mindanao; the principal Visayan trading port of Cebu, in the center of the islands; and Maynila in Luzon. By the sixteenth century, however, Butuan had declined as a trading center. Maynila, which the Spanish would make the seat of power in the islands in the late sixteenth century and shorten its name to “Manila,” constituted the preeminent settlement in Luzon, since it, with links to Muslim communities in Mindanao and Borneo, had a higher stage of political development. Its burgeoning status as a sultanate was however for ever disrupted when the Spanish razed Maynila in 1571, for cing the ruling datu and his people to flee. The year after, the Spanish started to erect the Walled City of Intramuros on the ashes of what could have been the Sultanate of Maynila. As noted, pre-colonial society was also marked by slavery, which, while it had several gradations, fell generally under two types of alipin: those who had their own houses and tended their own fields, and those who dwelt with their master. The for mer were known as namamahay (literally, one who keeps house), while the latter were referred to as sagigilid (literally, on the edge or periphery, i. e., living in the master’s household but of marginal status). The namamahay had more freedom than the sagigilid, and were practically freemen when not called upon to serve the master—which was not too of ten. In contrast, the sagigilid, usually unmarried and being part of their master’s household, were expected to render service on a daily basis. They also faced the possibility of being sold. But even they could eat at the same table as their master and had the prospect of moving up the social rung either through marriage—in cluding marriage into the master’s family—or, if they earned enough, through buying their freedom. The most common cause of slavery was the in ability to pay a debt, and the debtor had to remain in servitude, or his family (remember Namwran?) if the debtor had in the meantime passed away, until the debt was repaid with in terest. Since barangays at heart were kin-based, the hardships and conditions of bondage were relatively benign, compared, say, to the horrific conditions that African slaves endured when trafficked by Europeans to their colonies. Slaves, however, who were captured in battle or in raids on other barangays, being outside the clan, faced other potentially grim fates. They could be candidates for human sacrifice when the occasion demanded it, such as the death of a powerful datu. In his Relacíon de Las Islas Filipinas ( Account of the Philippine Islands ), published in 1604, a detailed and subjective portrait of sixteenth-century mores among the in digenous people, the Spanish Jesuit Pedro Chirino observed “it was easy to in crease the number of slaves. Consequently, they used to have, and still have, a very large number of slaves, which among them is the greatest of riches.” He also wrote, “In for mer times, they would not let them depart to the other world alone, but gave male and female slaves to accompany the dead. These slaves, having first eaten a hearty meal, were then immediately killed, that they might go with the dead man"

These slaves, having first eaten a hearty meal, were then immediately killed, that they might go with the dead man. It once happened that they buried with a chief a vessel manned by many rowers, who were to serve him in his voyages to the other world.” Nevertheless, social status in native society appeared to be quite fluid, malleable due to the possibilities of upward mobility through reducing one’s in debtedness and correspondingly in creasing one’s social prestige. The idea of an immutable hierarchy, as in the Hindu caste system, was notably absent. According to historian Vicente Rafael, in his Contracting Colonialism, “Village society owed its apparent mobility to the displaceability of obligations. Status reflected in debtedness, not the person…. Indeed, the possibility of shifting from one rank to another—as evidenced by the fine gradations of servitude—bespoke the tendency to dissociate status from person.” P EOPLE T RAVEL AND S O D O I DEAS Ports by nature are in teractive sites, as true millennia ago as it is now. Merchants, seamen, travelers, and emissaries from various culture zones not only traded goods but stories and ideas as well. Along with commerce, ideas made their way between the Mediterranean and the Middle East and the South China Sea, a globalization anticipating that of contemporary times. Traders, in short, brought the mselves and not just their goods. They were in dividuals with specific worldviews and beliefs that of ten were new to a port. Thus, Islam migrated via the Indian Ocean into Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula in just such a manner. However, this mix of religious, social, political, and cultural elements resists facile categorizing that would have the flow of in fluences only one way, from the “greater” to the “lesser,” as Abu-Lughod points out. The long unquestioned assumption has been that China and India were major in fluences on Southeast Asia, whose smaller states or communities were perceived as beneficiaries of supposedly more sophisticated continental cultures. But the reality was, as it is now, more complex than that. Interactions among different cultural agents were more layered and diverse than is conventionally presented. In fact, according to Solheim, archaeological excavations in Thailand in dicate that domestication of plants there began as early as 10,000 B. C. E. The excavations turned up an imprint of a grain of rice carbon dated to about 3,500 B. C. E., a thousand years before its presence was detected in India or China. According to Solheim, Thai metallurgy began in about 4,000 B. C. E., and fine quality bronze was already being produced by the third millennium, some 500 years before it was found in India and 1,000 years before China. Because of the development of the long-distance outrigger boats, trading in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea was underway by the first millennium B. C. E., enabling the two-way flow, as much from the lesser to the greater as vice versa. Nevertheless, while Southeast Asia was a more in teractive player in cultural matters than is usually envisioned, by the first millennium C. E., it was subject to major in fluences such as Buddhism and Hinduism, coming from China and India. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, with new powers in Asia coming to the fore—e. g., the Cholas, the Khmers, and the Burmese—diverse sets of relationships came about among realms that were not yet politically or culturally unified entities. And by the late thirteenth century, the Srivijaya empire had declined even as the Java-based kingdom of Majapahit was gaining power and Islam was taking root in Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula, shouldering aside the Hindu in fluence of the Srivijaya—though it has remained firmly rooted in the kingdom of Bali. The in fluence of the Srivijaya empire extended to parts of the Philippine archipelago, with Srivijaya colonists, as pointed out earlier, implanting the distinctive name of “Visayas” on its central cluster of islands. By the end of the eighth century, the empire in cluded all of the Malay Peninsula, a large portion of Sumatra, parts of Siam, and central Java. It had four substates—Bandjarmasin, Sukadara, Southern Sarawak, and Brunei. From Bandjarmasin settlers went to Sulu and west-central Visayas; the Borneans sailed to Panay, Palawan, Mindoro, and southern Luzon. Very likely the Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the cultural residue of such migration. Spanish documents from the sixteenth century record the existence of diverse crafts, such as shipbuilding—an absolute must in the archipelago—metallurgy, pottery, and weaving. They noted native weapons of the time as in cluding the lantaka (bronze cannons that were of ten mounted on swivels), lances and daggers tipped with iron, as well as bronze culverins. Metallurgy had long been practiced in the islands, along with dry agriculture, weaving, boat-building, and the construction of elevated lightweight houses with thatched roofs. In Palawan, the Manunggul Cave—part of the Tabon Cave complex—yielded iron objects and the extraordinary Manunggul Jar, described by the late American anthropologist Robert Fox as “perhaps unrivalled in Southeast Asia,” when compared to artifacts of the same era, providing “a clear example of a cultural link between the archaeological past and the ethnographic present.” This remarkable burial jar is made of clay with finely in cised motifs, and dates to the late Neolithic period, or about 710 B. C. E. The jar’s cover depicts two figures on a boat, a rower ferrying the dead person to the next realm, with its implicit belief in the soul and the afterlife.

This type of jar was most likely in troduced by the Hakka migrating from southern China’s Fukien region. Metallurgy was also evidenced in fine goldsmithing, with gold jewelry and or naments widespread throughout the archipelago, an in dication of the mineral’s abundance. The Spanish noted the delicacy and high degree of craftsmanship of gold work in the islands, particularly in the Visayas and in certain parts of Mindanao. Fervent capitalists, they complained that the mines were being worked only as needed and never at their maximum. The observant Chirino writes, “The islands are numerous and thickly in habited by a people who, though not rich, were accustomed to wear cotton and silk garments, and gold pieces (not merely of thin plate) and brooches to fasten them; and rich necklaces, pendants, earrings, finger-rings, ankle rings, for the neck, ears, hands, and feet—the men as well as the women. They even used to, and do yet, in sert gold between their teeth as an or nament.” Earlier, in 1521, the Venetian chronicler of the Magellan expedition that had come across the archipelago, Antonio Pigafetta, had noted the existence in some of the islands of “mines of gold, which is found by digging from the earth large pieces as large as walnuts and eggs.” Discoveries in the 1970 s in Surigao, northeastern Mindanao, of more than a thousand gold artifacts dating to the tenth to thirteenth centuries C. E., reflect sophisticated artistry and unusual craftsmanship. Acknowledging outside in fluences, experts on the subject nonetheless have concluded that pre-colonial Philippine techniques and motifs were unique to the islands. Among other items the cache in cluded golden sashes, earrings, diadems, funerary masks, body or naments, and ritual containers. One piece is particularly impressive: a gold halter of nearly four kilograms, quite possibly representing the Sacred Thread, a mark of the Brahmin caste in Hinduism. The halter and other objects with similar motifs clearly reflect Hindu in fluences—cultural reverberations from the Srivijaya empire—underscoring the presence of yet another layer in the archipelago’s diverse and complex pre-Hispanic culture. L IFE, L ANGUAGE, AND L OVE Being home to a diverse array of ethnicities, the islands possess close to 170 languages and dialects, with many on the verge of extinction. Nevertheless, the Austronesian language tree is the dominant source of the Philippines’ eight major to ngues—Cebuano, Tagalog, Hiligaynon, Waray, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Bicolano, and Kapampangan. Evidence in dicates that Austronesian languages came to the Philippine archipelago earlier than they did, say, to the Malay Peninsula. By the sixteenth century, to day’s languages were well established, evolving from their Austronesian roots to their distinct for mations as a result of the conditions peculiar to the islands. Tagalog, the lingua franca of historic Manila, capital of colonial times (both of Spain and the United States), forms the basis of the national language, Pilipino—much to the dismay of Cebuano speakers who outnumber native Tagalog speakers, and who remind anyone who listens that Cebu was where the Spanish first set up a settlement. In terms of script, at least ten syllabaries are known to have been used in pre- colonial Philippines, though literacy was not widespread, even if a number of Spanish accounts like Chirino’s say so. Tagalog script probably in fluenced the development of writing among the Visayans, whose pre-1565 culture stressed singing and chanting, relying on oral history for the transmission of tradition. Such practices occasioned socializing, and reinforced a barangay’s joie de vivre —antedating by several hundred years that contemporary and widely popular and communal form, the karaoke songfest. In Maynila, its datus wrote in the Kawi script, which seems to have disappeared by the time of Spanish conquest. They now wrote in a Malay or Arabic script called baybayin, as ment ioned earlier, since they corresponded with the Sultan of Borneo—an in dication of Islamic conversion up north, not only in Maynila but in other areas such as Batangas in the southern Tagalog region. Historian Corpuz believes that “the presence of writing and the making of written laws in the Manila area placed Manila ahead of other native communities in political development at the time of the Spanish contact, with the exception only of the Sulu and Maguindanao areas.” Unlike the sudden impact of the Spanish, extra-in sular cultural in fluences seeped in gradually, with none of the in tensity of other cultural encounters elsewhere in Southeast Asia, where Buddhism and Hinduism led the charge. Not surprising, as the more than 7,000 islands were on the northeastern edge of Southeast Asia. As noted earlier, pre-Hispanic Filipinos proved to be as peripatetic as anyone else, with small settlements in Malacca, Brunei, and Timor. They even fought as mercenaries in the employ of the Burmese kingdom. Given the abundance of and easy access to water, and the warm climate, the islanders were at tentive to matters of personal hygiene, especially to bathing— impressing both Pigafetta and Chirino. Chirino wrote admiringly: Both men and women swim like fishes, even from childhood, and have no need of bridges to pass over rivers. They bathe the mselves at all hours, for cleanliness and recreation; and the women after childbirth do not refrain from the bath, and children just born are bathed in the rivers and springs of cold water. When leaving the bath, they anoint the head with ajonjoli [i. e., oil of sesame] mixed with civet…"

      "context": ". Not surprising, as the more than 7,000 islands were on the northeastern edge of Southeast Asia. As noted earlier, pre-Hispanic Filipinos proved to be as peripatetic as anyone else, with small settlements in Malacca, Brunei, and Timor. They even fought as mercenaries in the employ of the Burmese kingdom. Given the abundance of and easy access to water, and the warm climate, the islanders were at tentive to matters of personal hygiene, especially to bathing— impressing both Pigafetta and Chirino. Chirino wrote admiringly: Both men and women swim like fishes, even from childhood, and have no need of bridges to pass over rivers. They bathe the mselves at all hours, for cleanliness and recreation; and the women after childbirth do not refrain from the bath, and children just born are bathed in the rivers and springs of cold water. When leaving the bath, they anoint the head with ajonjoli [i. e., oil of sesame] mixed with civet…. Through modesty, they bathe with their bodies drawn up and almost in a sitting posture, taking the greatest care not to be seen, although no one may be near to see them [except perhaps for the odd priest]. The most general hour for bathing is at the setting of the sun, because at that time they have finished their labors, and bathe in the river to rest and refresh the mselves; on the way, they usually carry some vessel for bearing water to use in their domestic duties. Visayans used citrus in laundering their garments, for the pleasant odor it imparted. They were fastidious, Scott notes, in their personal hygiene, using swabs to clean their ears and “vegetable husk for cleaning and polishing the teeth.” Unlike Legazpi, Chirino was impressed by the civility, courteousness, and upbringing of the Tagalogs, particularly in the use of the third person when addressing someone. Chirino was less taken by the Visayans, who “are more rustic and less civil in manners, just as their language is harsher and less polished.” On the other hand, Pigafetta commends the Visayans for their hospitality, graciousness, love of feasting, and music. It could very well have been a matter of in dividual temperament—Pigafetta more at tuned to worldliness than the priest—or Chirino having a bad day in his in teraction with the Visayans. Not surprisingly, both Pigafetta and the good Jesuit noted the relaxed at titude to wards sex, especially among the women. The pious cleric disapproved heartily of island hedonism. He believed that the devil had convinced women that their salvation was in the hands of men, “that a woman, whether married or single, could not be saved, who did not have some lover…. Consequently, virginity was not recognized or esteemed among them; rather, women considered it as a misfortune and humiliation. Married women, moreover, were not constrained by honor to remain faithful to their husbands, although the latter would resent the adultery, and hold it as just cause for repudiating the wife.” Pigafetta, no stranger to his shipmates’ earlier bacchanals in South America, gave a more detailed, at times, clinical, description of the islanders’ sexual mores, leading one to in fer that, being a scrupulous observer, he had witnessed Cebuanos in actual coitus and perhaps he had availed himself of the charms of the unmarried nubile women, whose beauty he remarked on: “These girls were very beautiful, and almost white and tall as ours. They were naked, except that from the waist to the knees they wore a garment … covering their nature.” Sexual pleasure, it seemed, was seen as a mutual goal—women were as important as men in this regard—rather than simply for the gratification of male desire and the propagation of the species. To that end, to please their partners, according to Pigafetta, men “have their penis pierced from one side to the other near the head, with a gold or tin bolt as large as a goose quill…. Some have what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends; others are like the head of a cart nail.” He goes on: “When the men wish to have communication with their women, the latter the mselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence very gently to in troduce it, with the spur on top first, and then the other part. When it is in side, it takes its regular position; and thus the penis always stays in side until it gets soft, for otherwise they could not pull it out.” Two lovers could thus remain locked in passion for hours, even a whole day. In this context, virginity was neither prized nor desirable, and polygamy was accepted—both of which practices the zealously Catholic Spanish at tempted to and did for the most part wipe out. To the macho Spanish, a sexually in dependent woman was in to lerable. One account described island women as “generally depraved … given to abominable lustful habits.” The fact that female desire was given equal weight profoundly disturbed the repressed and repressive Spanish patriarchs. Gender equality was evident in a language such as Tagalog with its nongendered nominative pronouns and in the prevalent creation myth that had man and woman as emerging from bamboo at the same time, both fully for med. In contrast to the biblical story of the creation of Adam and Eve, this one held the implicit promise of nonsexist gender treatment, as manifest in the sexual at titudes that titillated and shocked the Europeans. Variations on the creation myth in cluded both sexes arising from green coconuts, or as the result of an argument between primeval sky and water. The Tagalogs, Visayans, and the Igorots expressed belief in a supreme deity, as of course did the Muslims in the south. To the Tagalogs this god was known as Bathala May Kapal (“Bathala” is likely derived from the Sanskrit word for noble lord, Batthara ); to the Visayans, Laon; and to the Igorots, Kabunian. They also believed in lesser deities, such as those ruling over seas and rivers. The crocodile, once plentiful in the archipelago’s waterways, was revered, with of ferings to ssed on the water to placate its ravenous appetite. The Visayans termed the lower-ranked powers diwata (from the Sanskrit deva ), among them Magwayen, who ferried the dead to the afterlife; Makabosog, a Bacchus-like deity who in spired humans to prodigious bouts of eating and drinking; and a mischievous trio of expert poisoners—Naginid, Arapayan, and Makbarubak. Inhabiting the netherworld were frightful creatures such as the aswang, flesh eaters, and the manananggal, literally a fly-by-night ghoul that would leave half of its body in a secret place, while the other, upper half would move through the dark sky in search of a victim, preferably the fetus of an expectant mother, which it would then suck out, with its long, needle-like to ngue. Acting as in termediary between this world and the unseen one was the babaylan ( katalonan to the Tagalogs, mumbaki to the highlanders of Luzon)"

Acting as in termediary between this world and the unseen one was the babaylan ( katalonan to the Tagalogs, mumbaki to the highlanders of Luzon). This in dividual could be of either sex but was more of ten female, though the male babaylan were known for cross-dressing. The babaylan’s most common function was a diviner of fate. In a public ritual common to both lowlander and highlander, a sacrificial swine, preferably reddish in color, was killed by a quick, unerring thrust to its heart by the babaylan/katolonan/mumbaki who had gone into a trance. The pig’s entrails would be read, then consumed, with certain parts reserved for the seer. As a medium for spirits and practitioner of sacred rites, the babaylan occupied an important, and lucrative, position in the barangay. S/he acted also as medicine wo/man, midwife, dispenser of herbs and potions that healed the physical wounds, or of charms and in cantations if a person’s illness, or bad for tune, were thought to be the result of a hex put upon him or her—possibly by another babaylan more at tuned to black than white magic. As with the Spanish and their Southeast Asian neighbors, the pre-Hispanic populations believed in an afterlife, recognized the existence of in visible spirits, and feared demons, all of which were thought to significantly affect their lives. Many of their beliefs were animistic, at tributing supernatural power to elements of Nature. One basis for their sense of the otherworldly was the need to honor and respect their ancestors, whom they would sometimes elevate to deity status. Thus, they reverenced stones, the wind, headlands of water, and trees. To cut down an old tree, for example, was considered a sacrilege. Or to fail to ask permission to pass in front of an ant mound in a field was tantamount to in viting retribution (usually in the form of a mischievous trick) from the mound’s resident spirit, to which the Spanish word duende was affixed, though the meaning was closer to that of leprechaun than of creative spirit. Often, beside a house, would be a much smaller one, that contained some to ols and handicrafts but was also dedicated to an anito, or a local deity—similar to the shrines for the penates, household gods of the Romans, and the spirit houses of the Thais. The Ifugao carved wooden icons they called the bulul, a guardian deity of in determinate sex that stood guard over their warehouses of rice and was even thought to in crease the supply of stored grain. As exemplified by the Manunggul Jar, shuffling off this mortal coil meant a journey of the spirit to the next realm. Upon a person’s death, the corpse was prepared in different ways in anticipation of its voyage. In the Tagalog regions, the body was decorated and dressed in finery. In the highlands of northern Luzon, depending on the tribe, burial rites ranged from the placement of coffins in the vaulted ceilings of caves to mummification. In one region, the corpse was cleaned, dressed, set upright on and bound to a chair as members of the clan gathered around to mourn the person’s demise. There was no cemetery as such, and the dead could be buried in the ground underneath the house, usually elevated on hardwood posts, or in the fields. On occasion, with the death of someone of high status, such as a datu, slaves captured in raids were in terred as well. The manner of death may have differed —sometimes speared to death while tied to crosses, sometimes crushed by a boat that would roll over their prostrate bodies—but the in tent was the same: for the dead slaves to accompany the master on the new voyage, as they had when he was among the living. The soul or spirit of the deceased person wandered in another realm but could return, in which case those left behind made preparations to welcome that spirit. In a practical vein, the family would try to put that spirit to use in divining what the future might hold and otherwise putting in a good word, or in tervening, to assure the bestowal of good, and the avoidance of ill, for tune. At the wake, if the family could afford it, professional mourners would sing songs, eulogizing the deceased and relating, according to Chirino, “the fabulous genealogies and vain deeds of their gods.” T HE C RESCENT B EFORE THE C ROSS Islam predated the arrival of Christianity by at least a century and a half. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, Muslim missionaries from the by then mostly Islamicized Malaysia and Indonesia brought the word of the Messenger concerning Allah to the southern Philippines, even reaching Palawan, Mindoro, and the east coast of Luzon, notably Maynila. With ulamas, or Muslim communities, taking root, two large sultanates were subsequently established: in Sulu in the fifteenth century, under Sharif ul-Hashim, and in Maguindanao, near Cotabato City in the early sixteenth century, under Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan, who had left Malacca for Maguindanao. Thence, Islam spread to Maranao territory (around Lake Danao), in explicably skipped the Visayas for the most part, and sailed north to Mindoro Island and Maynila and Batangas in Luzon, and west to southern Palawan. Converted in digenous tribes such as the Tausug, Maranaoans, and Maguindanaoans could look to the older ulamas farther south. Certainly there were other outside in fluences, mainly from China and India, and their legacies can be seen in such diverse areas as language, art, cuisine, and kinship groupings, but Islam acted as a catalyst for in tra-settlement alliances and the beginnings of a civil state.

This feature, which distinguished the Muslim communities from the non-Muslim ones, proved essential in resisting Spanish efforts at colonizing southern Mindanao. Writing in 1603 to the Spanish king of the paramount Muslim datus of Mindanao—Umpi, Silonga, Buycan, and Rajaniora—Don Pedro de Acuña noted, “They have usually dissensions and controversies among the mselves, for he who has the most people and wealth seeks to be more esteemed than the others. But against the Spaniards and their other enemies, they confederate and unite, and or dinarily Silonga has the most power.” The sultanate had a centralized government similar to Islamic states in Borneo and Indonesia. Its head, the sultan, was owed allegiance by other datus. Though the latter governed their own followers, they occupied a subordinate position vis à vis the sultan, who alone could declare war, engage in dealings with other states, and otherwise decide on matters affecting the sultanate as a whole. The highly ceremonial courts in both Sulu and Maguindanao had Arabic speakers, religious scholars, and gentry with distinguished lineages. Clearly Muslim, still, these courts didn’t completely disavow pre-Islamic practices. As Scott puts it in Barangay, “Maguindanao ruled over a great many pagan people, and even the celebrated [Sultan] Kudarat was reported to have sacrificed three of his household slaves during a terrifying volcanic eruption.” With Islamicized communities spread strategically through the archipelago, from Luzon in the north, Sulu and Maguindanao in the south, and Palawan in the west, a persuasive argument can be and has been made that the archipelago would have evolved to wards an Islamic state or states, either as an in dependent nation, or part, say, of Indonesia or Malaysia, were it not for the Iberians. Spanish colonization meant the displacement of the crescent by the cross in most of the country. T HE C HINESE AND O THER M INORITIES As early at least as the tenth century, Chinese traders were regular visitors to the islands, going by the first ment ion of a Philippine island—Ma-Yi, current-day Mindoro—in extant Chinese records, which list 985, 1372, 1406, and 1410, as years of contact with the islands. Place names, such as Ma-Yi, Min-to-liang, Su- lu, and Lu-sung, in dicate recurring visits, with small Han communities springing up. In his accounts from the thirteenth century, Chao Ju-Kua, China’s Superintendent of Sea Trade from 1277 to 1287, referred to Ma-Yi (here taken to in dicate the Philippine archipelago), San-hsii (the Visayas) and Lin-hsing (Luzon). Imports from Southeast Asia, in cluding from the Philippines, in cluded cotton, yellow wax, coconuts, on ions and woven mats. But the steady and continuing in flux of the Chinese in larger numbers began only in earnest with the colonization of the archipelago by the Spanish, who needed the crafts and skills of Chinese artisans. To the Chinese traders—most if not all of whom were from the southern China coastal provinces such as Fujian, Amoy, and Guangdong—this meant a link to yet another trading network as well as access to sought-after Mexican silver, brought by the Spanish from Mexico. Both silver and new markets were accessible because of the profitable galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco, the transshipment point to Spain and the rest of Europe. (The galleon trade will be discussed in the next chapter.) The very nature of the archipelago, with more water than land, meant the existence of numerous tribal groups, other than the dominant ones—the Tagalogs, the Kapampangans, the Ilocanos, the Bicolanos, the Cebuanos, and other Visayans. Now known as cultural minorities, some sixty of them were and are to be found, still, throughout the country. Due to remoteness or effective resistance, they had limited contact with the Spanish. The Muslims of Mindanao, alert against Spanish encroachment, were the mselves composed mostly of three distinct tribes: the Maranaoans, the Maguindanaoans, and the Taosug, Islam being the religious glue that bound them, albeit loosely but never too loosely as to prevent unity (most of the time, anyway) against the Iberian foe. Other cultural minorities in Mindanao, especially those in the southern regions, such as the boat-dwelling Badjao, the Sama Laut, and the Yakan, were subject to pressure to convert to Islam. And for the most part they did. Tribes such as the T’Boli, the Mandaya, the Manobo, and the Bagobo, because they lived in the highlands, never converted wholesale to Islam. In Mindoro Island, off the western coast of Luzon, live the Mangyan in the rugged, mountainous in terior, whose Hanunoo branch was ment ioned earlier in connection with the use of baybayin, the pre-Hispanic script. Scattered along the western coast of Luzon, especially in its mountainous in terior, and found on some Visayan islands, are the Negritos (whom the Spanish also referred to as Negrillos ). Also known as Agta, Aeta, Ita, Ati, they are shorter than the average Filipino, of dark pigmentation and curly hair, and are related to the Australian Aborigines. There is an on going debate as to when they established the mselves in the archipelago, but their presence is believed to be older than that of the Austronesian migrations. They are thought to have used land bridges 30,000 years ago, most likely through the isthmus that once connected Palawan Island and Borneo. In the highlands of northern Luzon—the Cordilleras—live the previously ment ioned Igorot tribes, Igorot meaning “peoples of the mountain.” Among these are the Kalinga, the Bontoc, the Kankanay, the Ibaloi, and the Ifugao—the last named the builders of the magnificent rice terraces"

Only under United States colonial rule in the early twentieth century would Christianity gain a foothold in the mountains."

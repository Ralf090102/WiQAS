      "context": "INTRODUCTION FOR PRE-16 TH CENTURY READINGS Jose Rhommel B. Hernandez, Ph. D. The following are ten readings discussing certain aspects of the Pre-16 th Century Philippines. The excerpts are discussions of archaeological and historical studies on particular to pics concerning the Philippines. The first excerpt is from the article of archaeologists Armand Salvador Mijares and his team discussing the in itial finds in Callao Cave in Peñablanca, Cagayan. These findings would later on be the foundations in establishing the human remains as the Homo luzonensis. This is currently acknowledged as a species of Homo and thus establishing the Philippines as a part of the archaeological map of human evolution. The second excerpt is from the article of archaeologist Eusebio Dizon and his team on the human remains from the Tabon Cave in Palawan. Discovered in the 1960 s by the archaeologist Robert Fox, Dizon and his team went further in reassessing the area resulting in new dates and eleven more human remains. The readings three, four and five are from the study of Peter Bellwood and company regarding the Austronesians. The excerpts study different aspects of the migration and settlement of the Austronesian in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Included also are the Pacific Islands and Madagascar near the African Coast. Reading Sixth is from the work of archaeologist Alfredo E. Evangelista providing a glimpse on the life of ancient Filipinos based on the so-called “soul boats.” These “soul boats” are actually wooden coffins shaped like boats and are found in different archaeological sites in the Philippines. At around the same time of these “soul boats” is the document written by a Chinese bureaucrat named Chao Ju-Kua. The document is provided herein as Reading number 7 detailing some contacts made by the author with the peoples of Ma-yi which archaeologists and historians recognize as either Manila or Mindoro. Readings eight and nine are studies dealing with methodological problems in the field of Philippine Prehistory. Reading eight is from the lecture of F. Landa Jocano on the different problems in the study of Philippine Prehistory while Reading nine is from the study of historian William Henry Scott on the Maragtas. Reading ten is a transcript of a story regarding the first people of Sulu. Mythical at most but it shows the understanding of a group of people regarding their past. 11 “A New Species of Homo in the Late Pleistocene of the Philippines” This is an excerpt of the seminal article on the discoveries made by archaeologist Armand Salvador Mijares and his team (Florent Detroit, Philip Piper, Rainier Grun, Peter Bellwood, Maxime Aubert, Guillaume Champion, Nida Cuevas, Alexandra De Leon, Eusebio Dizon) in the Callao Cave in Peñablanca, Cagayan. This particular study details the discovery of the Right Metatarsal 3 (RMT 3) of a human being in Callao Cave, Cagayan. Now designated as the Homo luzonensis, the date of the said remains is 67,000 years Before Present. Comparisons were made with the other human remains found in Southeast Asia. Excerpt: Hominin movement into Island Southeast Asia has always been problematic due to the lack of well-dated human remains. The humid tropical environment of Island Southeast Asia contributes to the problems of bone preservation. Early modern human remains have, however, been recovered in Niah Cave in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, dating to 42 ka, and from Tabon Cave in Palawan dating to 47 plus/minus 10/11 ka. Borneo is located on the sunda shelf and was possibly joined by dry land to Sumatra, Java and Peninsular Malaysia during periods of lowered sea level in the Pleistocene. The island of Palawan may have been in termittently at tached to northeastern Borneo when sea levels reached their minima during the most extreme climatic phases. Thus, migrating human populations could have reached both islands with out necessarily requiring a sea crossing. To reach the rest of the Philippine archipelago and other islands in the Wallacean group (e. g., Sulawesi, Flores, Timor) that were never at tached to either mainland Asia or Australasia (Sahul), open sea crossings were required. The Lake Mungo remains from Australia dating to 40 plus/minus 2 ka are evidence that modern humans were capable of making early sea crossings. Homo floresiensis, discovered on the islands of Flores, Indonesia, is another hominin that managed to cross the Wallace line. While its remains are only dated to 18-38 ka, Flores also has stone artifact assemblages suggesting that a hominin of unknown affinity reached the island more than 800 ka years ago. Our recent excavations (2007) in Callao Cave have produced what is probably one of the earliest hominin fossils east of Wallace’s Line, from the island of Luzon, northern Philippines. The Callao Cave metatarsal in dicates that species of hominin crossed water gaps between Sundaland and Wallacea to reach northern Luzon by 67,000 years ago. The specimen leaves us with a conundrum—in size, it compares with modern Negrito populations, but a few morphological features are unusual. A comprehensive analysis of size and shape characteristics, in cluding comparisons with larger samples of Homo sapiens and fossil species of the genus Homo, is now needed. 12 Provisionally at tributed to a rather small-bodied Homo sapiens, the Callao MT 3 documents the presence of a hominin species on the island of Luzon as early as 67 ka, and is testimony to a capability to colonize new territories across open sea gaps. The Philippine specimen also in dicates that Flores was not the only island in Wallacea to be occupied by hominins more than 50,000 years ago. The discoveries of Callao Cave also raise some other important questions about the cultural behavior of these early colonizers of the Philippine Archipelago. For example, even though there is evidence of but chery in the animal bone assemblage, not a single stone implement was recovered, suggesting perhaps the use of an alternative technology. To answer such questions, more archaeological research in the cavies of karstic limestone for mations of the Philippines is required. 13 “Upper Pleistocene Homo sapiens From the Tabon Cave (Palawan, The Philippines): Description and Dating of New Discoveries” The following is an excerpt of a collaborative study between Filipino and French scholars on the much discussed and cited human remains of the so-called Tabon Man. The or iginal discovery was made in the 1960 s by the archaeologist Robert Fox. The authors of the study Upper Pleistocene Homo sapiens from the Tabon cave (Palawan, The Philippines): description and dating of new discoveries are Florent Detroit (French), Eusebio Dizon (Filipino), Christophe Falgueres (French), Sebastien Hameau (French), Wilfredo Ronquillo (Filipino) and Francois Semah (French).

The study reassessed the discoveries made by Fox in the 1960 s and resulted to new dates and yielded eleven more human remains. The or iginal article was published by Science Direct in 2004 under the category Human Paleontology and Prehistory. Excerpt: The Tabon Cave is located in the southwest coast of the Palawan Island. The site has been thoroughly studied in the 1960 s by Robert Fox from the National Museum of the Philippines. Owing to the discovery of long-lasting human occupation layers, abundant lithic in dustries and human fossils, the Tabon Cave is frequently quoted as one of the most important upper Pleistocene sites from in sular Southeast Asia. Indeed, it is worth noting that the human fossil record of this large geographical are still suffers a major gap corresponding approximately to the Upper Pleistocene period. Thus, the Tabon human fossils are among the very scarce specimens that could candidate to stand chronologically between the latest Indonesian Homo erectus (such as Solo Man) and the earlies Homo sapiens from in sular Southeast Asia. The age of the for mer group is still highly disputed, from more than 100,000 to least that 50,000 years BP, whereas the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens known up to now only date back to the very late Upper Pleistocene and Early Holocene period. Despite their high significance, the human remains recovered from the Tabon Cave had not been described and published after their discovery. Nor there have been at tempts to answer the numerous questions arising from the R. Fox’s pioneering work until recent fieldwork was undertaken by the Archaeological Division of the National Museum of the Philippines. A scientific collaboration between this in stitution and the Prehistory Department of the Museum national d’Histoire naturelle (Paris) resulted as a first step in the exhaustive paleoanthropological description of these historical human fossil finds and direct dating of the Tabon frontal bone. All the human fossils recovered from the Tabon cave, in cluding the early discoveries of the 1960 s show a similar aspect (reddish-brown color of the bones and abundant concretions on the bone surface) that in dicates that they probably underwent several fossilization processes. 14 Only a robust mandibular fragment from the earlier excavations appears to be considerably more mineralized than the other fossils. From the whole human fossil record, two specimens obviously differ from others. These are respectively the very robust mandibular fragment and the immature partial at las. All other specimens (frontal bone, mandibular fragment, ulna epiphysis, tibia diaphysis, fragments of fibula, partial calcaneus, metatarsal, proximal phalange and lumbar vertebra) show medium to small proportions and morphological features that correspond to an overall weakly built anatomically modern Homo sapiens. Therefore, it seems possible that they belonged to a single in dividual and from a strictly anatomical point of view, the minimal number of human in dividuals is 3 for the Tabon cave. However, the dating results, pointing to a discrepancy between the frontal bone, one of the fragmentary mandible and the tibia in dicate a probable higher number of in dividuals. Questions arising from these new discoveries deal with the relationships that could be traced between the specimens of the fossil record. From a biological point of view, one may ask whether the fossils unearthed represent one or more prehistoric human groups and, in a broader perspective, what are their phylogenetic relationship with other fossil Homo sapiens known from in sular Southeast Asian sites such as Niah (Borneo), Moh Khiew (peninsular Thailand) and the Gunung Sequ are (East Java). The association of specimens exhibiting respectively large and small overall dimensions points to the presence of at least two distinct Homo sapiens morphologies in the Tabon Cave during the Upper Pleistocene times. I t could be the result of a taphonomic association of two actually distinct groups of Homo sapiens (biologically and or/chronologically) or only reflect the presence of a single group characterized by a high sexual dimorphism. However, the for mer hypothesis seems currently more likely. The unnumbered left mandibular fragment shows an obviously more primitive overall morphology than any other in dividuals (large dimensions associated with a series of primitive morphological features). And, as a first impression, the pattern of association of morphological features documented by other specimens in dicates to some extent affinities with Australian fossil Homo sapiens. For in stance, the conspicuous morphology of the supra-or bital complex of the frontal bone, which combines projecting glabella and supraciliary arches with rather thin and clearly separated lateral trigones. 15 “The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspective” This is an excerpt of The Austronesians in History: Common Origins and Diverse Transformations from the book edited by Peter Bellwood, The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives (2006). It gives a general background on the Austronesian expansion. The Austronesians is a linguistic group recognized as the immediate ancestors of Filipinos as well as other Southeast Asians. Bellwood, a British Archaeologist who was educated in Cambridge and is one of the leading experts on the subject, effectively summarized in this brief excerpt the basic in for mation on the expansion of different Austronesian groups from Easter Island near Chile in South America until Madagascar.

Excerpt: It is necessary to return again to the linguistic evidence in or der to plot the geographical axes of expansion of early An-speaking peoples. Beginning with Pre-Austronesian level, a number of claims have been made for Asian genetic relationships between An and other Asian mainland language families. Perhaps the best known of these claims is the Austro-Thai hypothesis of Paul Benedict (1975; Reid 1984-5), which postulates that the Tai-Kadai and Austronesian language or chain of languages spoken on the southern Chinese mainland. Benedict has suggested a number of important vocabulary reconstructions for this ancestral language, in cluding terms for field, wet-field (for rice or taro), garden, rice, sugarcane, cattle, water buffalo, axe and canoe. The overlap between this list and that presented above for Hemudu and other coastal southern Chinese Neolithic sites needs little emphasis. One has to consider very seriously the possibility that the in itial expansions of Austronesians and Tai Kadai languages (and probably also Austroasiaic) began among Neleolithic rice-cultivating communities in China south of the Yangzi. The archeological record agrees very well and provides a date range for in itial developments between 5000-4000 BC. Moving beyond Austro-Tai into Austronesian proper, the reconstruction of linguistic prehistory which is most widely used to day is that postulated by Robert Blust (1884-5). This is based on a “family-tree” of subgroups and a hierarchy of proto-languages extending from Proto- Austronesian (Pan) for wards in time. Reduced to its essentials, Blust’s reconstruction favors a geographical expansion beginning in Taiwan (the location of the oldest Austronesian languages in cluding Pan), then encompassing the Philippines, Borneo and Sulawesi, and finally bifurcating, one branch moving west to Java, Sumatra and Malaya, the other moving east into Oceania (see Darrell Tyron’s more detailed summary in this volume). A wealth of linguistic detail can be added to this framework but here I will restrict myself to some implications of broad historical and cultural significance. During the linguistic stage before the break up of Pan it would appear that some colonies with an agricultural 16 economy moved across the Formosa Strait to the Chinese mainland to Taiwan (Mainland 19845, 1992). Here developed the Austronesian languages (s), and after a few centuries some of these languages made the first moves into Luzon and the Philippines. This movement led to the division of Austronesian into its two major subgroups, Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian (or Extra-Formosan). The reconstructed Pan vocabulary, which relates generally to this early Taiwan-Luzon phase, in dicates an economy we;; suited for marginal tropical latitudes with cultivation of rice, millet, sugarcane, domestication of dogs and pigs, and the use of some kind of watercraft. As a result of further colonizing movements through the Philippines into Borneo, Sulawesi and the Moluccas, the Malayo-Polynesian (MP) subgroup eventually separated into its several lower-or der Western and Central-Eastern branches. The break-up of Central-Eastern MP probably occurred in itially in the Moluccas, and Eastern MP contains all the Austronesian languages of the Pacific Islands apart from some in western Micronesia. The vocabulary of Proto-Malayo-Polynesia (PMP), a linguistic entity which might have been located somewhere in the Philippines, is of great in terest because it contains a number of tropical economic in dicators which were absent in the earlier and more northerly Pan stage. These in clude, according to Blust (1984-5), Colocosia taro, breadfruit, banana, yam, sago and coconut. Their presences may reflect a shift away from rice, a plant in itially adapted to sub-tropical latitudes, to wards a greater dependence on tubers and fruits in equatorial latitudes (Bellwood 1980 a, 1985). The PMP vocabulary also has terms for pottery, sailing canoes and several components of substantial houses (Zorc 1994). It may now be asked how the archeological record relates to this reconstruction of the directions and cultural components of Austronesian expansion. Specific archeological cultures cannot logically be equated with specific ancestral languages in prehistoric time. However, the appearance of certain technological and economic components of Pan and PMP can be searched for profitably in the archeological record of the area now occupied by Austronesian speakers. As already in dicated, it is a reasonable in ference that both Pan and PMP represent agricultural societies who, amongst other things, grew rice, made pots, lived in well-made timber houses and kept domesticated pigs. As it happens, direct material evidence of all these items survives in the archeological records of the islands of Southeast Asia, and all of them make an in itial appearance in widespread excavated sites between about 4000 and 1500 BC. Furthermore, their appearances (especially pottery) show a time trend – earliest in the northerly regions of China, Taiwan and Luzon and progressively later as one moves southwards into equatorial Indonesia and western Oceania (Springs 1989). Given this seeming correlation between the linguistic and archeological records (Bellwood 1985), we may hypothesize a direct association with the dispersal of the Austronesian language speakers, rather that dispersal of the cultural items by diffusion alone. The Neolithic archeological records in Taiwan began around 3000-4000 BC with archeological assemblages of southern Chinese type, presumably carried in itially by small 17 groups of agricultural settlers across the Formosa Strait from Fujian (Tsang 1992). Characteristic artifacts of the oldest sites in clude cord-marked pottery, polished stone adzes and slate spear points"

Characteristic artifacts of the oldest sites in clude cord-marked pottery, polished stone adzes and slate spear points. Other items such as slate-reaping knives and baked clay spindle whorls (for spinning thread for weaving) perhaps arrived a little later. By 3000 BC in Taiwan there is evidence for rice and from pollen records for in land clearance for agriculture. Between 2500 and 1500 BC related archeological assemblages with plain or red slipped pottery, rather than the older Taiwan cord-marked type, appeared in coastal and favorable in land regions of the Philippines, Sulawesi, northern Borneo, Halmahera and (with domestic pigs) to as far southeast as Timor. No sites of this period have yet been reported from the large islands of western Indonesia but research on pollen history in the highlands of western Java and Sumatra suggests that some fairly in tensive for est clearance for agriculture was underway there by at least 2000 BC, and probably earlier (Flenly 1988). In the equatorial latitudes of Indonesia there may also have been a shift away from rice cultivation to wards a much greater dependence on the tropical fruit and tuber crops listed above for PMP vocabulary. No cereals were ever in troduced into the Pacific Islands, with the exception of rice to the Marians. By 1500 BC, the refore, agricultural colonists had spread from Taiwan to the western borders of Melanesia. The continuing expansion through Melanesia western Polynesia, represented by the Lapita culture, seems to have been even more rapid than preceding movements, perhaps because food producing (as opposed to purely for aging) Papuan-speaking populations were already occupying some coastal regions of the large islands at New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Solomons. Finely decorated Lapita pottery has been round in coastal or of fshore island sites form the Admiralties in the west to Samoa in the east, a distance of about 5000 kilometers (see following chapters). This Lapita expansion occurred between 16000 to 1000 BC and to north and east of the Solomons it in volved, for the first sustained period in the Austronesian prehistory, the settlement of the ses uninhabited regions continued on wards (Irwin 1992), ultimately to in corporate all the islands of Polynesia and Micronesia and on the other side of the world, Madagascar. 18 “The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspective” This reading is a continuation of the previous excerpt from Peter Bellwood’s study on the Austronesians. In this part, the focus is on the rationale behind the expansion and migration of the Austronesians. For this, he cites seven possible reasons based on evidences of one of the most rapid colonization which occurred in the “Prehistoric agricultural word.” The rate of which the early Austronesian colonization occurred must surely be one of the most rapid on record from the prehistoric agricultural world, although admittedly much of it was across sea rather than into large and absorbent land mass. It was probably not caused simply by an over-reliance on land-hungry shifting cultivation, an explanation which I have favored in the past (Bellwood 1980 b), but by a number of different stimuli. These in clude, not necessarily in or der of significance: (1) Continuous population growth based on an agricultural supply, allowing a continuous generation by generation “budding-off” of new families into new terrain. (2) The in herent transportability and reproducibility of the agricultural economy to support colonizing propagules, especially on resource-poor small islands. (3) The presence of a deep and absorbent “frontier zone” available for colonization adjacent to the area of early Austronesians agricultural development, occupied purely by for aging populations (i. e. Taiwan and the Philippines in the early days of expansion), most of whom presumably have shown little in terest to adapting a systematic agricultural economy for the mselves. (4) A developing tradition of sailing-canoe construction and navigation. (5) A predilection for rapid coastal movement and exploration, probably to find the most favorable environments for cultivation and sheltered in shore fishing, and thus promoting a colonization pattern of wide-ranging settlements followed, of ten only centuries later, by territorial in-filling. (6) A culturally-sanctioned desire to found new settlements in or der to become a revered or even deified founder ancestor in the genealogies of future generations (presumably this evolved hand-in-hand with the colonization process itself); (7) A desire to found new resources of raw materials for “prestige goods” exchange networks. Not all of these stimuli were presented before the process of Austronesian expansion began; those listed at (4) and (6) particular surely evolve in part as a result of process itself, as might (7) if it was of major significance as an agency of colonization (which I doubt). However, it is my suspicion that the top root of the expansion process, a sine qua non, was the possession of a systematic agricultural economy capable of supporting continuous population growth. 19 The specific here may ask why, it agriculturally in duced population growth was so important; all early agricultural peoples did not simply expand in this way. I would reply that perhaps the majority of them did, and this becomes highly significant if one takes the view that early agriculture was an uncommon development in a primary form (i"

The environment plays major roles in the evolution of agriculture from a primary form. 20 “The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspective” The excerpt reading below is Peter Bellwood’s summary and periodization of the Austronesian expansion. The periods are based of course on the major transformations of Austronesian societies upon settling in the Island Southeast Asia. The summary is useful in asmuch as it gives students of history a tool for understanding the different periods of transformation in Philippine as well as Southeast Asian prehistory. Excerpt: Perhaps I may finally sketch, in brief, some of the major transformations, which I believe prehistoric Austronesian societies underwent in Island Southeast Asia between about 1000 BC and AD 1. (1) 4000-3500 BC; Initial Austronesian expansion to Taiwan; selded cereal and tuber agriculture, limited seafaring from South China. (2) 3000 BC; Proto-Austronesian expansion to the northern Philippines; improvement of seafaring technology; stylistic shift from cord-market to plain or red-slipped pottery. (3) Late third and second millennia BC; Proto-Malayo-Polynesian dispersal from the southern Philippines to Borneo, Sulawesi and the Moluccas, equatorial enhancement of fruit and tuber production vis-à-vis cereals, except in more southerly and climatically-seasonal islands such as Java where rice is presumambly always maintained its prominence. One development of great in terest which might have occurred about this time might have been the beginnings of for ager adaptions to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra (see Sather, this volume). (4) Second/first millennia BC? Beginnings of mobile maritime (proto-sea nomad?) adaptions around the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas (of Bellwood 1989 for a maritime economy with longdistance exchange at Bukit Tengkorak, Sabah, around 1000 BC), and possibly elsewhere. These, in turn might have laid some of the seafaring groundwork for: (5) Middle and late second millennium BC: Lapita colonization of Remote Oceania to as far as Tonga and Samoa. Seafaring skills were here developed further amidst an ever- expanding vista of uninhabited islands, but with few opportunities to settle on large western Melanesian islands (especially New Guinea) already in habited by Papuan- speaking peoples. (6) Second/first millennia BC? Austronesian settlement in Vietnam and Malaya, in both regions in competition with pre-existing agriculturists. (7) 500 BC and after. Introduction of bronze and iron metallurgy into Island Southeast Asia. Dong Son drums were also traded from Vietnam into the Sunda islands, extending from Sumatra to the Southern Moluccas. 21 Perhaps the metallurgical in troductions listed last above were no more than side effects of something much greater; the in corporation of parts of Island Southeast Asia into a network of Old World trade stretching from the Mediterranean to eastern Indonesia. Indian pottery of c 200 BC to AD 200 has now been unearthed in Java and Bali (Ardika and Bellwood 1991), and at the time the archeological records reveals a hitherto-unprecedented level of similarity in local potery design and manufacture across a huge region which in cludes coastal regions of the Sunda islands, borneo, Sulawesi and the Philippines. It is possible that a great deal of linguistic assimilation of prior (especially Old Malay itself), Javanese and perhaps other languages or subgroups (cf. Blust 1991 for the possibility of some kind of linguistic leveling in the Philippines). By AD 500 the Western Austronesian area was perhaps a zone of continuously flourishing in ter-island travel and trade, with the odd proviso that divorced into an almost to tal isolation from the rest of Island Southeast Asia. Such are the enigmas of history. 22 “Soul Boats: A Filipino Journey of Self-Discovery” The following is an excerpt of an article or iginally published in the multi-volume Philippine Heritage in 1978. This particular edition was taken from the book by Alfredo E. Evangelista himself entitled “Soul Boats: A Filipino Journey of Self-Discovery” published in 2001. Alfredo E. Evangelista is the for mer head of the Anthropology Division of the National Museum of the Philippines and was its Deputy Director until his retirement in 1989. He studied anthropology at the University Chicago and was under the tutelage of archaeologist Wilhelm Solheim and H. Otley Beyer in his excavations in the Neolithic settlements in the Bondoc Peninsula, Masbate and later in Romblon. The essay discussed some of the archaeological evidences of jar burials and coffin burials in the Late Neolithic period in the Philippines. Of particular in terest is the discussion on the so-called “soul boats” or wooden coffins shaped like boats found in different archaeological sites in the Philippines. Excerpt: Archaeological evidence and early ethnographic accounts by Spanish missionaries in dicate that the disposal of the dead in hollowed-out wood has had a long tradition in the Philippines. It developed side by side with other forms of burial in cluding the in humation of corpses wrapped in mats or tree bark, and in terment of corpses or skeletal remains (in jar containers) in caves or under the ground or in the open air. Where only the skulls were in terred the container used were or namented square boxes of either wood or baked clay, or simply slightly deep plates of both high and low-fired clay"

Where only the skulls were in terred the container used were or namented square boxes of either wood or baked clay, or simply slightly deep plates of both high and low-fired clay. In a few in stances, as in a Central Philippine burial cave, coffin and jar-burial were practiced simultaneously. Generally, the dug-out coffins were provided with lids triangular in cross-section, giving them the appearance of roofed boats. Consequently, they have been called “boat coffins.” Extrapolation from ethnographic data referred to these coffins as “soul boats” used by the spirit to sail to the world of the dead. Archaeological evidence appears to support this stance. Even where the bones were those of adults, in a practice termed secondary burial, the elongated shape of the coffin and its pyramidal roof were retained. Its overall length, though, was reduced, the coffin appearing at first glance to be a child’s. In a rock shelter in easter Masbate Island, for example, is a sawed-off banca with human skeletal remains in it. Being of recent in terment, the burial boat was left undisturbed. It appears further that the idea of burial in a box is as old as burial in a jar, as gleaned from recent archaeological activity in the Tabon Caves of Quezon, Palawan. In one of the chambers of a cave named Manunggul, a Late Neolithic jar-burial assemblage (C 14 date: ca. 1000 B. C.) was carefully excavated and studied. Almost a hundred funerary pottery vessels and their associated artifacts constituted the assemblage. An outstanding find was a magnificently 23 decorated burial jar which had a cover featuring a “ship-of-the-dead with the figures of two humans riding in it. This is the oldest evidence linking spirits with watercraft. Another remarkable find in this same cave was a pottery coffin, 73 centimeters long and 34 centimeters wide. This is the first known coffin made of pottery. In 1966, a report reached the Museum regarding a newly discovered burial using coffins. The in for mant claimed that he had explored the diorite for mation for hidden pirates’ treasure, about which he had read so much in books, and came upon a hole left by a fallen rock. He peeped into this hole and vaguely discerned a group of boxes that turned out to be coffins with human bones, or naments and highly-fired ceramic wares. He collected some of the latter and brought them to Manila as proof of his discovery. Of the 22 coffins counted, 17 were in perfect or good condition, the remainder being badly disintegrated, due to the depredations of the elements and termites. In common with the previous collections, the material for the coffins of the new site was also hardwood. Also common in both sites was the employment of the serpent motif carved a both ends of the lids. In some in stances, the rendering was abstract, but in most cases the head, eyes, jaws and teeth were carved in the round. One head had a hollowed-out set of eyes, suggesting that artificial eyeballs were once embedded in them. In a number of cases, the to ngue of the serpent jutted out or in its place was a carved figure of a human being halfway in the serpent’s jaws, so that only the pelvic area and the lower limbs showed. Other motifs were those of the monkey and an unidentifiable four-legged animal, although these were not as commonly used as the serpent. The coffins had been carved out of a species of hardwood locally called mulawin (Vitex parvilora), which was still obtainable in the island. From the coffins that still contained the skeletal remains of adults, it was concluded that the mode of burial was secondary, otherwise the corpses would not have fit into the coffins. In addition to the coffins, the workers recovered two Chinese brown-glazed stoneware jars that contained the bone remains of a juvenile in one and of an adult in the other. The site was evidence of the practice of jar-burial existing side by side with coffin-burial. If the coffins and the bones were well preserved, so were the artifacts. The associated potteries from South China and Siam appeared to have just left the factory. As well-preserved were the beads of carnelian and glass, the bracelet of trochus shell and the or naments of gold. Particularly exciting in the matter of preservation were the perishable artifacts that survived the elements. Of the Chinese jarlets, one still had a wooden stopper. Other perishable items in cluded a coconut-shell cup bamboo artifact, and combs and bracelets of turtle shell. No other pre- Spanish site has so far yielded such objects. 24 CHAO JU-KUA’S DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILIPPINES The Following is an excerpt of Chao Ju-Kua’s Account of Certain Barbarians written ca. 1280.

About one thousand families in habit the shores of a river which has many windings. The natives dress in linen, wearing clothes that look like sheets; or they cover their bodies with sarongs. In the thick woods are scattered copper statues of Buddha, but no one can tell the or igin of those statues. Pirates seldom visit those districts. When [Chinese] merchantmen arrive at that port they cast anchor at a place [called] the place of Mandarins. That place serves them as a market, or site where the products of their countries are exchanged. When a vessel has entered into the port, (its captain) of fers presents consisting of white parasols and umbrellas which serve them for daily use. The traders are obliged to observe these civilities in or der to be able to count on the favor of those gentlemen. In or der to trade, the savage traders are assembled, and have the goods carried in baskets, and although the bearers are of ten unknown, none of the goods are ever lost or stolen. The savage traders transport these goods to other islands, and thus eight- or nine-months pass until they have obtained other goods of value equivalent to those that have been received [from the Chinese]. This for ces the traders of the vessel to delay their departure, and hence it happens that the vessels that maintain trade with Ma-yi are the ones that take the longest to return to their country. The most noteworthy places of this country are: San-hsii; Pai-pu-yen; Pu-li-lu, which is located near San-hsii; Li-yin-tung; Lin-hsin; and Li-han. The products of that country are yellow wax, cotton, pearls, shells, betel nuts, and jute [ yu-ta] textiles. Foreign traders import porcelain, commercial gold, iron vases for perfumes, leaden objects, glass, pearls of all colors, and iron needles. San-hsii, or the “Three Islands,” belong to Ma-yi. Their names are Ka-may-en, Pa-lao-yu, and Pa-chi-neng. Each of these islands is in habited by its own races, who are scattered 25 throughout them. But upon the arrival of the vessels, the natives assemble in or der to trade. Their general name is San-hsii. Their customs are about the same as those observed in Ma-yi. Each tribe consists of about one thousand families. The country has many lofty hills and rugged rocks which rise up like gigantic walls. The houses of the in habitants are built of bamboo. The high region of the country has few springs, but the women go to the banks of the rivulets and creeks and the nce back to the mountain bearing on their heads two or three jars filled with water, a load that does not bother them. They ascend the mountain with the same ease as if they were on the level. The in terior of the valleys is in habited by a race called Hay-tan. They are of short stature, have round yellow eyes, curly hair, and their teeth can be plainly seen [showing] from between their lips. They build their nests in the for king of the branches of trees, and a family, usually consisting of from three to five in dividuals, lives in each nest. They wander through the fastnesses of the thickets and in visible to the sight, shoot their arrows at the passers-by. On this account they are greatly feared. When the trader takes them a porcelain jar, they bow and take it, and then uttering cries of joy, run away with it. When for eign traders come to one of their villages, they must not to uch the ground, but must remain aboard their vessel, which is anchored in the middle of the current and announce their presence by beat of drum. Thereupon the savage traders approach in their light craft, in which they carry cotton, yellow wax, strange cloth, cocoanuts, on ions, and fine mats, and all those things they of fer for sale in exchange [for the articles of the Chinese]. In case of misunderstanding in the price of the goods, it is necessary to summon the chief of the traders of that place, so that he may present himself in person, and arrange the tariff to the satisfaction of all. The imported objects are silk umbrellas, porcelain, and a kind of basket woven from rattan. Foreign traders receive twice or thrice the value of the goods sold aboard, in or der to serve them as a bond of security. Afterward the for eign traders disembark and perform their contracts there, and then return to their vessel. The goods pledged by the natives remain only three or four days aboard the vessel, and then after the expiration of that term they are restored [to shore]. Then the vessel visits another village of the savages, for the coast villages of the Three Islands do not have one common jurisdiction. The hills keep the winds from the vessels during the continuance of the northeast monsoon. But when the southwest monsoon begins, the dashing of the waves against the coast is so violent that great currents are for med that do not allow the vessels to remain at anchor. This is the reason why those who maintain trade with the Three Islands delay their return for four or five months. Porcelain, black damask, and other silk fabrics, pearls of various colors, lead, fishnets, and tin are imported. Pu-li-lu is near Three Islands. Its villages are very densely populated, but its in habitants are very cruel and in clined to piracy. The sea is full of reefs and shoals, and the beach has rocks which are in dented like dry wood, and their points are very sharp like those of swords and spears. In or der that the vessels may reach that country, they take a long and circuitous route, in or der to avoid those shoals. There are corals there, but it is very difficult to get them. The popular and trading customs are the same as those which exist at the Three Islands. 26 “Questions and Challenges in Philippine Prehistory” F.

LANDA JOCANO The following is an excerpt of the seminal lecture of Filipino anthropologist F. Landa Jocano entitled Questions and Challenges in Philippine Prehistory which was or iginally published in the Historical Bulletin in the years 1983 and 1984. F. Landa Jocano holds an MA and Ph D in Anthropology from the University of Chicago. He taught at the Department of Anthropology at the University of the Philippines where he later served as its chairperson. He also taught at the UP Asian Center and the UP Institute of Philippine Studies. The particular excerpt below is from the compilation made by N. M. R. Santillan and M. B. P. Conde entitled Kasaysayan at Kamalayan: Mga Piling Akda Ukol sa Diskursong Pangkasaysayan published in 1998. Jocano’s essay discussed the discipline of Philippine Prehistory and is basically a synthesis of his findings during his years of research. It is in this essay that he questioned the commonly held Wave Migration Theory and proposed his own Core Population Theory. Excerpt: The in ner value of scholarship is change. We cannot hold on to old ideas when new empirical evidence no longer supports them. We cannot afford to continuously make the same historical in ferences from old data when new the or etical or ientation leads us to advance new hypotheses and to other better in terpretations. Hypotheses are developed because we want to have a clearer knowledge of the relationships between the data or sets of data we are studying. As a general alternative to earlier ways of looking at Philippine Prehistory, as well as our relations with the other peoples of Island Southeast Asia, the following proposals are advanced: 1. The peoples of Island Southeast Asia belonged to the same population. This is what we call the core population. It grew out of the combination of human evolution which occurred in Island Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago, as evidenced by the fossil materials recovered from different parts of the region, and the movements of other peoples from Asia mainland during prehistoric times. 2. The core population share a common cultural or ientation as evidenced by similarities in their tool tradition that in cluded both flake and core implements and their complex ceramic in dustries that in cluded cord-making and designs made on the plastic surface of 27 unfired pottery with a carved paddle. Others shared cultural elements consist of similar or naments, pendants, house types, belief systems, ritual complex and funerary practices. 3. The configuration of these shared elements into a common way of life is what we call the base culture. It emerged from similar responses people made to similar geographical conditions, climate, fauna and flora. Certainly, there were variations due mainly to the relative isolation of some islands. But as a whole, there were (as there are still) more things that ancient men in the region held in common than those which they did not. 4. None of these ancient men could be categorized under any of the historically identified ethnic groups (i. e., Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos) to day. The Western colonizers were the ones who fragmented the population into ethnic groups as they partitioned the region into their respective colonies. Thus, variations in cultural and historical experiences started to become clear-cut as the colonizers defined the boundaries of their territorial trusts. The British popularized, in scholarship the term Malay to characterize the group of people they encountered in the Malay Peninsula. The Portuguese, the Germans and the Dutch in troduced the Indonesians to the Western World. The Spaniards strongly worked for the conversion of Filipinos (for merly Indios) to Christianity. Later on the Americans came and further differentiated the Filipinos from their Southeast Asian cousins. 5. In this connection, the explanation of the peopling of the Philippines through a series of waves of migration, as documented by folk history like the Maragtas, has to be reconsidered. The undue credit given to the Malays as the or iginal settlers of the region and dominant cultural transmitter must be corrected. The movements of peoples during prehistoric times were complex events which cannot be explained by the simple sequential migrations of people from one are to another. Emerging from a common population with the same base culture, the Malays, Filipinos and Indonesians are co-equal as ethnic groups in the region of Island Southeast Asia, with out any one of them being racially or culturally dominant. In conclusion, we hope that the base culture hypothesis may lead us to a concerted effort to wards better understanding of Philippine prehistory and enlightened cooperation among the peoples of Island Southeast Asia. Now that our common heritage has been defined, we also look for ward to the emergence of regional consciousness and a common (regional and racial) designation that none of the present names is capable of encompassing. May the base culture idea equalize the roles of each group in the region, with out one having to appear dominant simply because of an allegation, with out any supporting evidence, that they were the ascendants and or iginators of cultures. 28 Kalantiaw: The Code that Never Was The reading is an excerpt of William Henry Scott’s article entitled Kalantiaw: The Code that Never Was.” Scott is known to be the American historian who first questioned the existence of the Maragtas and the Wave Migration Theory which was partially based on the said document. He specializes on the 16 th century Philippine History as well as the northern Philippine ethnic groups. His dissertation which he defended in the late 1960 s at the University of Sto. Thomas entitled Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History has become a model of historical and historiographical criticism in Philippine historical studies. The article at hand discussed briefly a part of his dissertation, particularly the mythical code of Kalantiaw. This would somehow show that historical study is a continuous consideration and in vestigation of sources"

The article at hand discussed briefly a part of his dissertation, particularly the mythical code of Kalantiaw. This would somehow show that historical study is a continuous consideration and in vestigation of sources. The sources are bases of a meaningful past. There is the refore an absolute need to study them continuously. Excerpt: The Marco-Pavon Antigua Leyendas is the source, and the only source of the Kalatiaw Code. The Code the refore can be no more valid than the for gery which contains it. It is entitled “The 17 the ses or laws of the Regulos in use in 150 since 1433,” and was supposedly discovered in the possession of a Panay ruler in 1614, its or iginal being still in the possession of on e Don Marcilio Orfila or Zaragoza in 1839. The figure “150” must mean 1150 in accordance with the usual custom of abbreviating dates and the example in the second chapter of Part II where the year of a Kalatiaw-built for tress is given as 433 in stead of 1433. This makes the statement “in use in 1150 since 1433” ridiculous, of course, but no more ridiculous than the fact that the fort-building date of 1433 appears in a source itself dated 1137. Despite these peculiarities, however, Robertson published an English translation of the Code in apparent good faith in 1917, the same year Soncuya published the Spanish version. The name of Kalatiaw himself appeared in print for the first time in a 1913 article by Manuel Artigas in the Renacimiento Filipino, “Informes in editos sobre Filipinas,” which made ment ion of “prehispanic civilization…a calendar, written laws, forts.” Artigas was the head of the Filipiniana Section of the Philippine Library, and the year before, he had supplied footnotes to Marco’s “Resena historica—which is a matter of fact, were much more scholarly than the book itself. The name is documented in no earlier source, though digno alba of Kalibo, in connection with the in auguration of the new province of Aklan in 1965, sought it in local folklore. I had tried to get stories or legends from the present generations of Aklanons living in Batan,” he later wrote, “but not one old man can tell me now.” By this time, Kalantiaw was well on his way to becoming a National Hero. In 1966, Sol H. Gwekoh’s “Hall of Fame” gave new biographic details—e. g., Datu Bendahara Kalantiaw was born in 1410, his father was Rajah Behendra Gulah, and he became the third Muslim ruler in 29 Panay at the age of 16. Then in 1970, Gregorio Zaide’s Great Filipinos in History argued that his real name was Lakan Tiaw and gave a direct quote— “The law is above all men.” The next year, the Manila Bulletin reported the celebration of the 538 th anniversary of the promulgation of the Code on 8 December with the coronation of the Lakambini ni Kalantiyaw. Artist Carlos Valino, Jr., depicted the event itself in oil on canvas with the law-giver reading from a node of bamboo held vertically. The President of the Republic bestowed the Order of Kalatiaw on deserving justices, and a 30-centavo postage stamp was issued to commemorate his name. finally, lest some future generation for get a Filipino who “possessed the wisdom of Solomon, the fighting prowess of Genghis Khan, and the sagacious statesmanship of Asoka, “his Code was fittingly in scribed on brass in the Kalantiaw Shrine in Batan, Aklan. The contents of the Code itself are no less peculiar. They were presumably promulgated by a central authority of sufficient power to put local chieftains to death for failure to enforce them, and prescribe 36 different of fense irrationally group in 18 the ses, punishable by 15 kinds of corporal and capital punishment bearing no relation to the nature or severity of the crimes. Legalist commentators have not been wanting to cite the codes of Leviticus or Hammurabi for comparisons of severity, but what is in credible about the Kalantiaw Code is not its severity but its capricious viciousness. Its catalogue of punishments alone sound like the fantasies of some uninhibited sadist—plunging the hand into boiling water three times, cutting off the fingers, laceration with thorns, exposure to ants, swimming for three hours, drowning weighted with stones, beating to death or being burned, boiled, stoned, crushed with weights, cut to pieces, or thrown to crocodiles. One wonders what pedagogical mischief has been done to three generation of Filipino youth by the belief that their ancestors suffered a society submissive to such a legal system. 30 The First People of Sulu The following excerpt is from a story entitled “In Tau Nakauna” or the First People Sulu.

They were not 10 people, give men and five women. They lived to gether and begot children. One day, one of the tall men with a long nose and one of the short men decided to go in search of some populated land. They left in a small banca which they paddled day and night. This trip took not only weeks but months. After some time, they ran out of food so they ate what they could get from the sea. When they ran out of seafood, they found the mselves scraping the bottom of their boat and eating what they could pick from the scrapings. They wanted badly to to uch land but there was none in sight, no place to dock. One night, at about two o’clock in the morning, their drifting boat suddenly stopped. They tried to get it moving by rocking it, but they could not move it an inch. They waited for daylight and they discovered that they had run aground. “We are lucky,” one said. “Now we can go around and look for wood for new paddles. After all, there is no land with out any trees.” One of them with a small ax got off the boat and went looking for wood the badly needed paddles. With his small ax, he immediately started cutting a bamboo which was about 16 in ches in diameter. He did not make any dent in it and a voice was heard. “Hey don’t hit me!” Since there was nobody, he lifted his ax but he heard the voice, “You don’t obey me, don’t hit me!” He 31 was afraid and at the third time he raised his ax he chose another spot to cut the bamboo. This time there was no sound. He fell the bamboo slowly. As he split the bamboo, a discovered a beautiful woman in side. The lady in the bamboo told him that she was there hiding from a prophet who she refused to marry after learning that the life of a prophet is not an easy one. They proceeded to make their paddles and the man left in the banca was glad that there are now the three of them. They starting rowing until the second night when they once again reach land. In the morning, they found that they were on a rock why they called Bud Talipaw. The tall man said that they should settle and make it their home. Not long after, the tall man made love to Tuwan Putli Indal Suga and they lived as a married couple. Of this union, seven children, all boys were born. As they grew big, their mother told the father, “Now that our seven boys have all reached maturity, we better plan for their future, decide where they will live and divide the land among them. This is how the land was divided. Luuk was given to the son with black eyes; the Taglibi to the son with green eyes; Talipaw went to the son with brown eyes. The boy with blue eyes was given the trading center (Now Jolo town) while the son with the greenish eyes got Lipid and the son with the white eyes Parang. Finally, the son with the yellow eyes received Sawaki. These were the first seven men born in sulu, the people of Sulu, Lupa’ Sug as it was called. The name Islam was to be added later when the Muslim faith spread to this part of the world. 32 TOPIC 2: 16 TH -18 th CENTURY PHILIPPINES List of Reading Materials: 1. Customs of the Tagalogs 2.

Readings eight, nine and ten are accounts of three rebellions starting among the datus of Tondo, to the rebellions of Tamblot and Bankaw in the Visayas until the Agricultural Revolt of 1745. 34 Customs of the Tagalogs Juan de Plasencia is a Franciscan friar who ministered in the Philippines from 1578 until his death in around 1590. Originally from Plasencia in Extremadura Spain, he is acknowledged as the founder of numerous to wns in Luzon using the method of reducción. He also authored books on language and the famous Doctrina Cristiana published posthumously in 1593 and is the first book printed in the Philippines. The following is an excerpt of his long ethnography on the Tagalogs having been assigned in the Tagalog provinces of Bulacan, Laguna, Morong (Rizal) and Tayabas (Quezon). The reading discusses the social, political, economic and cultural setup of the Tagalogs at the period of early contact with the Spaniards. Plasencia documented the different social classes and their particular functions in the early Philippine society. Excerpt: This people always had chiefs, called by them datos, who governed them and were captains in their wars, and whom they obeyed and reverenced. The subject who committed any of fense against them, or spoke but a word to their wives and children, was severely punished. These Chiefs ruled over but few people; sometimes as many as a hundred houses, sometimes even less than thirty. This tribal gathering is called in Tagalo a barangay. It was in ferred that the reason for giving the mselves this name arose from the fact (as they are classed, by their language, among the Malay nations) that when they came to this land, the head of the barangay, which is a boat, thus called became a dato. And so, even at the present day, it is ascertained that this barangay in its or igin was a family of parents and children, relations and slaves. There are many of these barangays in each town, or, at least, on account of war, they did not settle far from one another. They were not, however, subject to one another, except in friendship and relationship. The chiefs, in their various wars, helped one another with their respective barangays. In addition to chiefs, who corresponded to our knights, there were three castes: nobles, commoners and slaves. The nobles were the free-born whom they call maharlica. They did not pay tax or tribute to the dato, but must accompany him in war, at their own expense. The chief of fered them beforehand a feast, and afterward they divided the spoils. Moreover, when the dato went upon the water those whom he summoned rowed for him. If he built a house, they helped him, and had to be fed for it. The same was true when the whole barangay went to clear up his lands for tillage. The lands which they in habited were divided among the whole barangay, especially the irrigated portion, and thus each one knew his own. No one belonging to another barangay would cultivate them unless after purchase or in heritance. The lands of the tingues, or mountain ridges, are not divided, but owned in common by the barangay. Consequently, at the time of the rice harvest, any in dividual of any particular barangay, although he may have come 35 from some other village, if he commences to clear any land may sow it, and no one can compel him to abandon it. There are some villages, as for example, Pila de la Laguna, which these nobles, or maharlicas, paid annually to the dato a hundred gantas of rice. The reason of this was that, at the time of their settlement there, another chief occupied the lands, which the new chief, upon his arrival, bought with his own gold; and the refore, the members of his barangay paid him for the land, and he divided it, among those whom he saw fit to reward. But now, since the advent of the Spaniards, it is not so divided. The commoners are called aliping namamahay. They are married, and serve their master, whether he be a dato or not, with half of their cultivated lands, as was agreed upon in the beginning. They accompanied him whenever he went beyond the island, and rowed for him. They live in their own houses, and are lords of their property and gold. Their children in herit it, and enjoy their property and lands. The children, then, enjoy the rank of their father, and they cannot be made slave (sa guiguilir) nor can either parents or children be sold. If they should fall by in heritance into the hands of a son of their master who was going to dwell in another village, they could not be taken from their own village and carried with him; but they would remain in their native village, doing service there and cultivating the sowed lands. The slaves are called aliping sa guiguilir. They serve their master in his house and on his cultivated lands, and may be sold. The master grants them, should he see fit, and providing that he has profited through their in dustry, a portion of their harvests, so that they may work faithfully. For these reasons, servants who are born in the house of their master are rarely, if ever, sold. That is the lot of captives in war, and of those brought up in the harvest fields. 36 Recopilación de Leyes de los Reinos de las Indias The following is an English translation of the or iginal Spanish legislations found in the Recopilacion de Leyes de los Reinos de las Indias or the Laws of the Indies concerning the establishment of the Reducciones. The Reducción is the process of transferring the natives to a particular settlement. It was also used to designate the place where the settlement was established. The Recopilacion is a compilation of the different laws promulgated by the Queen or the King of Spain and were legislated to guide the Spaniards in the colonies as to their behavior to wards the natives.

The Reducción is the process of transferring the natives to a particular settlement. It was also used to designate the place where the settlement was established. The Recopilacion is a compilation of the different laws promulgated by the Queen or the King of Spain and were legislated to guide the Spaniards in the colonies as to their behavior to wards the natives. It was first released as a compilation in 1680 under King Carlos II. The legislation below can be found in Book VI, Title III and provided guidelines for the establishment of to wns or pueblos. The copies of the laws were said to have been provided and translated by Zelia Nuttall (1857-1933), an American anthropologist specializing in Aztec-Mexican cultures. The legislations are of importance to the Philippines since these are the same legislations used in the establishment of the to wns until the 19 th century, immediately before the Revolution of 1896. It thus created a new landscape besides the social and economic changes throughout the period of Spanish colonization. Excerpt: On arriving at the locality where the new settlement is to be founded, the plan of the place, with its squares, streets and building lots is to be outlined by means of measuring by cord and ruler, beginning with the main square from which streets are to run to the gates and principal roads and leaving sufficient open space so that even if the town grows it can always spread in a symmetrical manner. Having thus laid out the chosen site the settlement is to be founded the following form. The chosen site shall be on an elevation; healthful; with means of for tification; fertile and with plenty of land for farming and pasturage; fuel and timber; fresh water, a native population, commodiousness; resources of convenient access and egress. It shall be open to the north wind. If on the coast, care is to be taken that the sea does not lie to the south or west of the harbor. If possible, the port is not to be near lagoons or marshes in which poisonous animals and corruption of air and water breed. In the case of a sea coast town, the main plaza is to be the starting point for the building of the town, is to be situated near the landing place of the port. In in land to wns the main plaza should be in the center of the town and of an oblong shape, its length being equal to at least one and half times its width, as this proportion is best for festivals in which horses are used and any other celebrations which have to be held. The size of the plaza shall be in proportion to the number of residents, heed being given to the fact that to wns of Indians, being new are bound to grow and it is in tended that they shall 37 do so. Therefore, the plaza is to be planned with reference to the possible growth of the town. It shall not be smaller than two hundred feet wide and three hundred feet long nor larger than eight hundred feet long and three hundred feet wide. A well proportionated medium size plaza is not six hundred feet long and four hundred feet wide. From the plaza, the four principal streets are to diverge, one from the middle of each of its sides and two streets are to meet at each of its corners. The four corners of the plaza are to face the four points of the compass, because thus the streets diverging from the plaza will not be directly exposed to the four principal winds, which could cause much in convenience. The whole plaza and the four main streets diverging from it shall have arcades, for these are a great convenience for those who resort thither for trade. The eight streets which run into the plaza at its four corners are to dos o freely with out being obstructed by the arcades of the plaza. These arcades are to end at the corners in such a way that the sidewalks of the streets can evenly join those of the plaza. In cold climates, the streets shall be wide; in hot climates narrow, however, for purposes of defense and where horses are kept the streets had better be wide. The other streets laid out consecutively around the plaza are to be so planned that even if the town should in crease considerably in size it would meet with no obstruction which might disfigure what had already been built or be a detriment to the defense or convenience of the town. At certain distances in the town smaller, well proportion plazas are to be laid out on which the main church, the parish church or monastery shall be built so that the teaching of religious doctrine may be evenly distributed. If the town lies on the coast, its main church shall be so situated that it may be visible from the landing place and so built that its structure may serve as means of defense for the port itself. After the plaza and streets have been laid out building lots are to be designated, in the first place, for the erection of the main church, the parish church or monastery and these are to occupy respectively and entire block so that no other structure can be built next to them excepting such as contribute to their commodiousness or beauty. Immediately afterwards the place and site are to be assigned for the Royal and Town Council House, the Custom House and Arsenal which is to be close to the church and port so that in case of necessity one can protect the other. The hospital for the poor and sick of non- contagious diseases shall be built next to the church for ming its cloister. 38 Historia de los Padres Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas y en sus Misiones del Japon, China, Tung-kin y Formosa The following excerpt is from the Noticias Preliminares (Preliminary Notes) of the six volume work by the Dominicans Juan Ferrando and Joaquin Fonseca titled Historia de los Padres Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas y en sus Misiones del Japon, China, Tung-kin y Formosa published from 1870-1872.

P. arrived in the Philippines around 1842 and was assigned to Vigan as companion to the Bishop Rafael Masoliver. He is described as more clear, concise and methodic of the Dominican historians of the Philippines. Utilized in this excerpt were the writings of historians like Diego Aduarte, O. P. and Francisco Antolin, O. P. He was able to finish the Historia to in clude the events until the year 1840. His unpublished work was later edited by Joaquin Fonseca, O. P. who added an appendix bringing the work down to the year 1871. Below is a part of the English translation by Jose Rhommel B. Hernandez and published in 1994 containing the description of the “Negros” and as later on labeled in the text itself, the Aetas. Excerpt: Not only in Luzon, but also in the Visayas can be found the true oceanic blacks which form an entirely different race from the rest known in the discovered world. In the Philippines, they are known by the Spaniards as the “Negritos,” and by the natives, as Aetas, Itas, Etas, Balugas, etc., according to the provinces in whose surroundings they live. They are very likely the first in habitants of the country. In nothing are they similar to those of the Malay race in the divisions, color, hair, customs and mode living. Even their dialect is distinct from that which the nations coming from their caste speak. Many of the like those who go down to the to wns speak the idiom of the Indios. Many doubt if they have a proper idiom. In their dances, however, they sing in an unintelligible manner and many seem to howl rather than sing. In their hair, not all are equals. Some tribes have it somewhat straight, but they are generally curly, like those who come from Africa, although not so dark. The color of the body is so dark, much more than that of the natives of the Malay race. They have their mouths broader than the or dinary, and more distant from the nose, which is small and grounded in some. Almost all have side burns and some have beard. Their clothing is made of a miserable girdle which covers their shame. The women, when going to the Christian to wns cover their breasts with another piece of cloth made of cotton or valete bark. They are of very limited in telligence, although in some can be discovered signs in dicating more than the regular talent, if they will be cultivated. Their race can be called as the ultimate of the human species. Their physique has all the characters of a savage and degraded race. They the mselves have an idea so low of the mselves that they say that they are not men nor people, but 39 Aetas. They live within the for ests in the ranges of the west of Manila Bay, from Mariveles until Pangasinan; in the slopes of one and another side, from that which crosses the island from the east to west from San Fabian until Valer; to the west of some to wns of Cagayan, and in the other ranges from the Cape of Engaño until Tayabas; in the mountains of San Mateo and Camachin; in some parts of the provinces of the South; in a word, they are in almost all the mountains of Luzon, grouped in small tribes with relations between the mselves, particularly the neighbors of a same range. They do not have any dwelling other than bad huts under the trees and at time some entangled branches to avoid in some way the effect of bad weather. Most of them sleep where the night seizes them, and when they are cold, or the humidity is very great, they burn bonfires and they turn the mselves over on hot ashes. They are not dedicated to agriculture and are maintained from wild roots, leaves of trees and cattles that by chance opens itself to an arrow shot. They suffer much on rainy days, and days passed with out them taking anything other than herb. For the hunting of the wild boar, or wild hogs, they have some arrows whose iron points are held with a cane by means of some strong small cords. The arrows are released to enter into the body of the wild beast, which afterwards remains in the thickets and the hunter is easily freed from its fangs, which is known to cause terrible wounds. Their government consists in leaving each one in a more complete liberty, and in the observance of some practices in herited from their old one. One of them is the eating in common large cattle gathered by some of them. There is no sign of religion found among them, as they may not be some practices in dicating their belief in the immortality of the soul. Their matrimonies are solemnized with some brute feasts that do not merit the hardship of being narrated. The essential ceremony consists in making an old woman nod at those engaged, saying sometimes the following expressions: “Produce the man, produce the woman”, very proper to designate the primary end of the marriage, in which they differ hardly from the beasts. In some points they the mselves go around burning notably, as happens in the mountains of Bataan, an effect of the miserable life they live. They lack women, since the Tagalog Indias hire many of them to their service. These women are mixed at times with the Indios, and the Mestizos who are born from them do not have curly hair. There is someone saying that their feature is better than that of the Tagalog. Those who live in the surroundings of the Christian to wns are voluntary slaves. For a little rice or other trifle, they cross from great distance wax, wood, canes and reeds. All have their patrons, who give them lodging when they go down to the to wns. This benefit is not little favor considering the disgust that is in their uncovered bodies, covered regularly from the hips and groins. From the conversion of the natives of the islands which the missionaries began, they also thought of converting the people of this degraded caste. But nobody until now has been able to boast of have subjected and united a tribe for a long time to show them the civil and Christian life"

The work was published from 1788 until 1792. The following excerpt narrates a certain Fray Rodrigo’s experience in working with the Filipinos near Bagumbayan which was then a highly for ested area. The brief anecdote is a rich source of the possible transitions happening in the minds of the Filipinos in their reception of Christianity. Excerpt: Father Fray Rodrigo was one day passing through a thicket. That thicket was, according to their customs, one of the reserved ones, and it was considered sacrilegious to cut anything from it, and that such act would be punished with immediate death. So in fatuated were they with that blindness that no one, even though in great need, dared to take anything from that place, being restrained by fear. The Father saw a beautiful tree, which they call pajo, laden with ripe fruit. He or dered his followers to gather some by climbing the tree. They strenuously resisted, but Father Fray Rodrigo in sisted on it. They declared that they would not do it under any circumstances, and that it meant sure death if they of fended the respect whose fatal sentence comprehended all the trees of that place. The Father severely chided them for their error, and to show them that it was so, he determined to gather fruit himself. He began to break branches and to clear the trunk, in or der to facilitate the ascent. The Indians were grieved, and urgently begged him to desist from that undertaking which they considered as so rash. But the religious, arming himself with the sign of the cross, and reciting the antiphon, Ecce lignum crucis, managed to gather some of the ripe fruit, which the tree of fered. He ate it in front of them and liked the fruit very much, for in deed it is savory. They looked as his face amazed, expecting his in stant death. When that did not happen, they recognized their delusion and detested their cheats. They also ate with out experiencing any harm. The Father charged them to say nothing upon their arrival at the village. He took with him a goodly quantity of that fruit and divided the great portion of it among the chiefs. Esteeming the gift, they, in their ignorance, ate it with out fear. In a sermon on the following day, the Father disclosed the secret and checked their vain fears; so that, undeceived by experience, they followed him with their axes, and in short or der felled that thicket, which was a confused center of perverse in iquities. Thereupon, many of those in fidels submitted to the true knowledge. 41 Relacion de las Islas Filipinas The author of the following excerpts is the Jesuit Fr. Pedro Chirino. He first arrived in the Philippines as a young priest in 1590 and was assigned to Balayan and later on to Taytay in the following year 1591. He studied the Tagalog language and was one of the first missionaries to deliver sermons in that language. His masterpiece is his Relacion de las Islas Filipinas which was published in Rome in 1604. The two excerpts shows the status of the Tagalogs in the early years of the Spanish contact particularly their everyday life and language. Excerpt: The Filipinos are not so ceremonious in their actions as are the Chinese and Japanese; yet they have their politeness and good breeding, especially the Tagalos, who are very civil and courteous in word and action. Upon meeting one another, they practice our custom of uncovering the head--not that they used hats, caps, or bonnets; but they wore a piece of cloth like a to wel, some three or four palmos long, which they wound around the head in becoming fashion, like the ancient crowns or diadems. This they removed, as they now do the hat [sombrero]--which they have adopted, in imitation of us, abandoning the potong, as they called the to wel or diadem which they for merly wore. As among them it is not courtesy to remain standing before a person whom they respect, they seat the mselves upon the ground, or rather on their heel-bones. Seated in this way, with head uncovered and the potong thrown like a to wel over the left shoulder, they talk with their superiors. The mode of salutation upon entering or meeting anyone is as follows: They draw the body to gether and make a low reverence, raising one or both hands to the face, and placing them upon the cheeks; they next sit down waiting for the question that may be put to them, for it is considered bad manners to speak before one is spoken to. Their greatest courtesy is in their form of address; for they never speak to one as \"thou,\" or in the second person, whether singular or plural, but always use the third person, saying for example--\"Does the lord, or the chief, wish for this or that?\" There are many examples of this to be found in Holy Scripture or sacred language, and particularly in the Psalms. In the relations of man with woman, woman with man, or woman with woman, they are very careful--even when they are quite equals, and, too, among the middle class--to use, after every important word, nothing but \"my Lord,\" or \"my Lady;\" as, \"My Lord, as I was coming up the river, I saw, my Lord,\" etc. This term and pronoun are used as agreeable and even affectionate, even in the languages of much greater importance, as Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, which are the three most venerable to ngues"

In polite and affectionate in tercourse, they are very extravagant, addressing letters to each other in terms of elaborate and delicate expressions of affection, and neat turns of thought. As a result of this, they are much given to musical practice; and although the guitar that they use, called cutyapi, is not very in genious or rich in tone, it is by no means disagreeable, and to them is most pleasing. They play it with such vivacity and skill that they seem to make human voices issue from its four metallic cords. We also have it on good authority that by merely playing these in struments they 42 can, with out opening their lips, communicate with one another, and make the mselves perfectly understood--a thing unknown of any other nation. The Bisayans are more rustic and less civil in manners, just as their language is harsher and less polished. They have not so many terms of courtesy, as for merly they had no letters until, a very few years ago, they borrowed the irs from the Tagalos. As we have already treated of their languages, it would be advisable to make some ment ion of their letters. 43 Relacion de las Islas Filipinas This is a continuation of Chirino’s discourse on the Filipinos. Specifically, he discussed the alphabet and writing system the Filipinos of his time. Significantly, the description is still one of the basis of to day’s studies on the baybayin. All these islanders are much given to reading and writing, and there is hardly a man, and much less a woman, who does not read and write in the letters used in the island of Manila--which are entirely different from those of China, Japon, and India. This will be seen from its alphabet, which is as follows: The three vowels serve as five, and are: A I O a e i o u The consonants are only twelve, and in writing are used with the vowels in the following form. The letter alone with no point above or below it, is pronounced with the vowel-sound A: BA KA DA GA HA LA MA NA PA SA TA YA Ba ca da ga ha la ma na pa sa ta ya By placing the point above, each is pronounced with the vowel-sound E or I: BI KI DI GI HI LI MI NI PI SI TI YI Bi qui di gui hi li mi ni pi si ti yi Be que de gue he le me ne pe se te ye 44 By placing the point below, they are pronounced with the vowel-sound O or U. BO KO DO GO HO LO MO NO PO SO TO YO Bo co do go ho lo mo no po so to yo Bu cu du gu hu lu mu nu pu su tu yu Consequently, to pronounce _cama_, two letters with out points are sufficient: KAMA _ca ma_. If a point is placed above the KA we have KIMA or _que-ma. If a point is placed below each character KOMO the word is _co-mo_. Final consonants are suppressed in all forms of expression: accordingly _cantar_ is written KATA _ca ta_; _barba_, BABA _ba ba_. By means of these characters they easily make the mselves understood and convey their ideas marvelously, he who reads supplying, with much skill and facility, the consonants which are lacking. From us they have adopted the habit of writing from left to right. Formerly they wrote from the top to the bottom, placing the first line on the left (if I remember right), and continuing the rest at the right, contrary to the custom of the Chinese and Japanese--who, although they write from top to bottom, begin from the right and continue the page to the left. They used to write on reeds and palm-leaves, using as a pen an iron point; now they write their own letters, as well as ours, with a sharpened quill, and, as we do, on paper. They have learned our language and its pronunciation, and write it even better than we do, for they are so clever that they learn anything with the greatest ease. I have had letters written by the mselves in very handsome and fluent style. In Tigbauan I had in my school a very young boy, who, using as a model letters written to me in a very good handwriting, learned in three months to write even better than I; and he copied for me important documents faithfully, exactly, and with out errors. Let this, however, suffice for the matter of languages and letters, and let us return to our employment for souls. 45 Práctica del Ministerio The following is an excerpt of the Augustinian Tomas Ortiz’s Practica del Ministerio.

In the confessions, for the same reason that but seldom will they accuse the mselves all possible efforts ought to be made (with out overstepping the boundaries of prudence) in or der to see whether anything may be obtained; and he who has the good for tune to have any witch confess to him, will bear himself to ward her as the authors teach. They ought also to charge the natives with their obligation to denounce to the or dinary, etc. There are many abuses (or as they say ugales) which the natives practice against our holy faith and good customs, among others of which are the following. First, the above-ment ioned idolatry of the nonos. In regard to this it must be noted that the word nono does not alone signify “grandfather,” but that it also is used as a term of respect to the old men and genii. The Indians comprise these under the word nono, just as the Chinese do under the word Espiritus [ i. e., “spirits”], and the Romans under the word “Gods,” which other called Lares, Penates, etc. With the above-ment ioned genii or nonos the Indians perform many acts of idolatry frequently, such as for example, asking permission, relief, and aid from them, and that they do the people no harm, and that they do not prove hostile to them, etc. They make such requests on many occasions, and among others are the following. When they wish to pluck any flower or fruit from the tree, they ask permission from the nono or genius to pluck it. When they pass certain fields, rivers, creeks, or streamlets, large trees, sugar-cane plantations and other places, they ask permission and good passage from the genii or nonos. When they are obliged to cut any tree, or not to observe the things or ceremonies which they imagine to be pleasing to the genii or nonos, they ask pardon of 46 them, and excuse the mselves to those beings by saying, among many other things, that the father commanded them to do it, and that they are not willingly lacking in respect to the genii, or that they do not willingly oppose their will, etc. When they are taken with the sickness that they call pamave, which they at tribute to the genii or nonos (although they try to conceal this by saying that the country [has not?] agreed with them) they ask them for health and of fer them food. They do that both on this, and many other occasions, in the fields, sugar-cane plantations, streamlets, at the foot of any large tree, more generally some calunpan,2 and in various other places. This sort of idolatry is very deeply rooted and of long standing among the Indians. Consequently, it is very necessary for the father ministers to be very careful and make great efforts to extirpate it, and not avoid any labor or work until it is annihilated. Secondly, the Indians very generally believe that the souls of the dead return to their houses the third day after their death, in or der to visit the people of it, or to be present at the banquet, and consequently, to be present at the ceremony of the tibao. They conceal and hide that by saying that they are assembling in the house of the deceased in or der to recite the rosary for him. If they are told to do their praying in the church, they refuse to comply because that is not what they wish to do. Consequently, the minister will prevent the gathering at the house of the deceased after the burial, and will not allow the people to ascend into the house under any considerations, least of all on the third day. On the fourth day, in consequence of the said ceremony of the tibao, or because of their evil in clination, they light candles in or der to wait for the soul of the deceased. They spread a mat, on which they scatter ashes, so that the tracks or footsteps of the soul may be impressed the reon; and by that means they are able to ascertain whether the soul came or not. They also set a dish of water at the door, so that when the soul comes it may wash its feet there. It does not appear that it would be much to say that those matters of the nonos or genii and the deceased were taken by the Indians from the Sangleys who are reared with various things [of belief]. It needs a strong remedy nevertheless. The tigbalāg which some call a ghost and others a goblin, appears to be the genius or devil, who appears to them in the shape of a black man, or in the shape of an old man (or as they express it in the shape of a very small old man), or in the shape of a horse, or of a monster, etc. That being in spires them with so great fear that they come to make friendship with him, and surrender their rosaries to him, and receive from him superstitious things, such as hairs, herbs, stones, and other things, in or der that they may obtain marvelous things, and that they may be aided by him in certain of their affairs. The patianac whom some also call a goblin (but it is only their in vention, dream, or imagination) must be the genius or devil who generally plays with them as also with many others, when losing the faith, they espouse his cause, become familiar with him, or become subject to him. They at tribute to this being the ill success of births, and say that in or der to harm them and cause their destruction, he enters or hides in some tree or in any other place near the house of the woman who is about to give birth, and there they sing like those who wander about, 47 etc. In or der to prevent any harm from the patianac, the men take their position naked and with their privies exposed to the air; and arm the mselves with shield, catan, lance, and other arms"

In this condition they stand on the ridgepole of the roof, and also under the house, and in all places, they slash and cut right and left with the catan and make various gestures and set movements for the same purpose. Others, in or der to prevent said harm, generally move the woman who is about to give birth to another house, for they say that her house contains a patianac. Among other things they also at tribute to the patianac the death of children, as well as to the usang. They refer to them in the following manner. They assert that the bird called tictic is the pander of the sorcerer called usang. Flying ahead of that being, the bird shows it the houses where in fants are to be born. That being takes its position on the roof of the neighboring house and the nce extends its to ngue in the form of a thread, which it in serts through the anus of the child and by that means sucks out its entrails and kills it. Sometimes they say that it appears in the form of a dog, sometimes of a cat, sometimes of the cockroach which crawls under the mat, and there accomplishes the abovesaid. In or der to avoid that harm, they do certain of the above things. To the patianac travelers also at tribute their straying from or losing their road. In or der to keep the right path, they undress and expose their privies to the air, and by that observance they say that they make sure of the right road; for then the patianac is afraid of them and cannot lead them astray. The bongsol they sometimes assert to be various durojones which are caused by the sorcerer ganay, and which run all through the body of the bewitched, who generally remains some moments as if dead or in a faint, and at other times as though mad or raving from the sight of the ganay who appears to them in various shapes. In or der to cure this sickness or enchantment, they summon another sorcerer, and he after the in cantations or efforts, which will be told later, generally leaves the patient as he was before. Sometimes they say that that sickness appears to be natural or a stomach ache caused by the obstructions or durojones which grow in the stomach or in the patient’s side or by shivers which move from one place to another, and from which the women of this country generally suffer. But when they are unable to cure the pain with the promptness that they desire, they generally say, especially the physicians, that the said sickness is bongsol, that is enchantment, and that it can be cured only by the one who is of the faculty, that is by one who is a sorcerer. They then bring a sorcerer, who performs the things that pertain to his faculty, and summons the first sorcerer who they say caused that sorcery. If the sickness is not lessened, the sorcerer finishes his duty by saying that the said first witch is very far away, and could not hear him; and consequently, it has happened that he has not been able to cure the said sickness. In such wise do they leave the sick person with his pains. The ceremony or superstition of bilao is or dered for the discovery the reby of any thief. It is reduced to placing in a bilao, sieve, or screen, some scissors fastened at the point in the shape of the cross of St. Andrew, and in them they hang their rosary. Then they repeat the name of each one of those who are present and who are assembled for this. If, for example, when the name 48 Pedro is ment ioned, the bilao shakes, they say that Pedro is the thief. They also are accustomed to light candles to St. Anthony of Padua for the purpose of discovering the thief of anything [that is stolen]. For this they kneel down to pray (and perhaps to utter and perform in decent things) and wait until the flame leans to ward any of those about, for in stance, to ward Juan, and then they declare that Juan is the thief. It is very usual for the Indians to carry about them various things in or der that they might obtain marvelous effects: for example, written for mulas, prayers, vitiated or in terspersed with words arranged for their evil in tent, herbs, roots, bark, hairs, skin, bones, stones, etc., so that they may not be killed, or apprehended by justice, or to obtain wealth, women, or other things. 4 They are also very much in clined to believe in omens and in unlucky days, in regard to which they are wont to keep various books of manuscripts which must be burned for them. The natives are accustomed to circumcise the boys; and although they perform the circumcision by slitting the skin of the penis lengthwise, in stead of around, still it appears that that may be accounted for by the fact that it is in ferred that that ceremony was in troduced into Philipinas, by the Moros from Borneo, Mindanao, or Holo, as was also the word biñag, which is used for “baptize,” and to mean “Christian,” and the word simba, which appears to mean “adoration” among them. From this use they transfer it to their temples and mosques, and the Tagálogs took it not to mean “adoration,” but “church,” and afterward used it to mean “mass,” which it never could mean. Not only do they circumcise the males but also the women, girls, or dalagas, [an operation] which they call sonad. It is reduced to cutting the or gan or opening it up somewhat.

They are also accustomed to measure or compare the weapons that they make, for ]example, measuring the catan by spans and praying at the same time the “Our Father.” If the conclusion of the measuring is reached at the same time or when they come to the word “for give us” they say that they cannot be punished, but that they may kill people, etc. It appears that the custom has been in troduced among women who have recently brought forth of not going to church until the for tieth or sixtieth day as they say of the purification of their bodies. In that not only do they fail in the precept to hear mass but they also perform a Mosaic ceremony. The Indians are generally corrupted by many errors, and it would take a long time to ment ion them. Consequently, the ministers will be very careful to uproot them, for although it does not cause any great harm in some because of their ignorance and lack of in telligence, in others they do cause great harm; for example, Angel catutubo, which literally signifies “that my guardian angel was born with me or at the same time as I.” In or der to avoid danger, one should say, Angel taga tanor, and the same thing in other languages. Finally, so many are the superstitions, omens, and errors, that are found among the Indians that it would be very difficult or impossible to ment ion them all. The above have been ment ioned so that the father ministers may examine others by them. It is to be noted that there 49 are sectarians and preachers of various false sects among the Indians, especially in the distant provinces, either because they had false sects for merly and have continued them, or because they took them (and this is more likely) from the Joloans, Mindanaos, Sangleys, and other heathen nations with whom they are accustomed to have in tercourse. When the moon is eclipsed, the Indians of various districts generally go out into the street or into the open fields, with bells, panastanes, etc. They strike them with great force and violence in or der that they might the reby protect the moon which they say is being eaten or swallowed by the dragon, tiger, or crocodile. And the worst thing is that if they wish to say “the eclipse of the moon” it is very common in Philipinas to use this locution, saying “the dragon, tiger, or crocodile is swallowing the moon.” The Tagálogs also make use of it and say, Linamon laho bovan. It appears that the Indians learned all this from the Sangleys of China, where all the abovesaid is performed and executed to the letter. It is not right to allow them to retain these deceits of the Chinese, and not to teach them our customs and truths. All the above contents of this section is not universal in all parts. Consequently, although all ministers ought to be careful to ascertain whether they are or are not contained in their ministries, they ought not to go ahead to censure what they are not sure of, for that very thing would perhaps teach them what we are endeavoring to extirpate. 50 Conspiracy Against the Spaniards (1588) The following is an excerpt of the document signed by the notary public for King Philip II stationed in the Royal Audiencia summarizing the events commonly designated as the “Tondo Conspiracy.” The document accounts the events wherein the Datus of Tondo led by Agustin de Legazpi, Martin Panga, Magat Salamat and several others conspired to fight off the Spaniards occupying their territories. The conspiracy would be the first major rebellion of the Tagalog area against the colonizers. The conspiracy was thwarted when Antonio Surabao revealed the plans to the Spaniards. This led to the execution of the leaders and the exile of many others who were in volved. The Spaniards in response to the event would ease down their policies when it comes to the Principales who would then receive benefits and privileges from the administration. Excerpt: In fulfilment of the command and decree of Doctor Santiago de Vera, governor and captain-general of these islands, and president of the royal Audiencia, I, Estevan de Marquina, notary-public for the king our sovereign, of the number [authorized] in the city of Manila, testify that a trial and criminal process has been conducted and is still pending before the said governor and captain-general. The parties are the royal department of justice of the one part, and certain Indian chiefs, natives of the villages of Tondo, Misilo, Bulacan, and other villages in the neighborhood of Manila, of the other part. The cause of this contention seems to be that on the twenty-sixth of October of last year, one thousand five hundred and eighty-eight, Doctor Santiago de Vera, governor and captain-general of these islands, and president of the royal Audiencia, learned that the following persons: Don Agustin de Legaspi, one of the chiefs of this land; Martin Panga, governor of the village of Tondo, and his first cousin; Magat Salamat, the son of the old lord of this land; and other chiefs, had not long ago sent a present of weapons and other articles to the king of Burney, and that they were quite in tent upon holding meetings and their usual drunken feasts, swearing to keep secret whatever they discussed. He also learned that they had sold and were selling their landed property. In or der to ascertain what the condition of affairs is, the governor made an in quiry and many witnesses were summoned. From this in quiry and other in vestigations and in quests made in the course of the trials, it appears that the said Don Agustin de Legaspi and Magat Salamat had sent a quantity of shields, arquebuses, and other weapons to Xapon and to the petty king of Burney, who has thus been enabled to put himself on a war-footing"

It appears that on the fourth of November of the said year, when the in quiry had not gone further than this, Captain Pedro Sarmiento arrived in this 51 city from the Calamianes, which are islands near Burney; and brought the news and in for mation that he had left behind in the said Calamianes three Indian chiefs of Tondo, namely, Magat Salamat, Don Agustin Manuguit, son of Don Phelipe Salalila, and Don Joan Banal, brother-in- law of the said Magat. Through Don Antonio Surabao, his servant and chief of his encomienda, he had learned that these men were going as ambassadors to the petty king of Burney, in or der to in duce him to send a fleet to at tack the Spaniards, and to join the chiefs of Jolo, and Sumaelob, chief of Cuyo, who had already come to terms and of fered to help them with two thousand men. They had persuaded the said Don Antonio Surabao to accompany them and carry out their plans; but the latter while on the one hand he promised to help them, in or der not to arouse their suspicion, on the other hand unfolded the plan to Captain Sarmiento. He added, moreover, that Amarlangagui, chief of Baibai, who was within the jurisdiction of Manila and held the of fice of master-of-artillery, had told him, while in this city, that all the chiefs of this neighborhood had plotted and conspired with the Borneans to rebel against the service of the king our sovereign, and to kill the Spaniards of this city, while they were off their guard. The plan was that when the fleet of Burney reached the port of Cavite, and the Spaniards trustfully called these chiefs to their aid, they would all immediately enter the houses of the Spaniards with their men, for tify the mselves in them and thus take possession of them one by one. If the Spaniards took refuge in the for tress, Indian soldiers would follow them; and, being two to one, they would surely kill the Spaniards. Maluco of fered an example of this; for with but few people they had taken so large a for tress from the Portuguese. To this end the people of Burney were building seven galleys and other warships, and were getting ready ammunition and war-material. Thus, it is affirmed by the said Don Antonio Surabao himself, who says that, under the pledge of friendship and secrecy, he was made acquainted with all this, and was persuaded to join the said conspiracy. Upon this, with the governor's approval, soldiers and at tendants were immediately despatched with his or ders to arrest the said chiefs, and to bring them to this city as quickly as possible. From the in quiry and secret in vestigations which were taken up anew, it appears that last year, five hundred and eighty-seven, when Captain Don Joan Gayo and many Japanese with merchandise arrived at this city in a ship from Xapon, Don Agustin de Legaspi became very friendly to him, in viting him many times to eat and drink at his house which is on the other side of the river of this city. The agreement and stipulation which he made with Don Joan Gayo through the Japanese in terpreter, Dionisio Fernandez, and in the presence of the said Magat Salamat, Don Agustin Manuguit, Don Phelipe Salalila, his father, and Don Geronimo Bassi, Don Agustin de Legaspi's brother, was, that the said captain should come to this city with soldiers from Xapon, and enter it under pretext of peace and commerce, bringing in his ship flags for the use of the Spaniards, so that the latter should think his in tentions peaceful. It was also agreed that the chiefs of the neighborhood would help them to kill the Spaniards, and would supply the provisions and everything necessary. The said Don Agustin de Legaspi was to set out to meet them; and, in or der that they might recognize one another, he would carry some of the weapons which the said captain had given him. After they had conquered the Spaniards, they would make him [Don Agustin] king of the land, and collect the tribute from the natives, which would be divided between Don Agustin and the Japanese. They swore this after their fashion, by anointing their necks with a broken egg. Don Agustin de Legaspi discussed and arranged the whole plan with Amaghicon, an Indian chief of Navotas, warned him to keep the secret, and gave him some of the weapons which the Japanese 52 had given him, in or der that they might recognize on eanother. According to the declarations of Dionisio Fernandez, the Japanese in terpreter, Don Phelipe Salalila, Don Geronimo Basi, Magat Salamat, and other witnesses who were present at the said meetings and compacts, and as it appears also from the trial and in vestigations, it seems that when Don Martin Panga, under the charge of adultery, Don Agustin de Legaspi, for accounts demanded of him at the time when he was governor of Tondo, Don Gabriel Tuambaçan, Don Francisco Acta, his son, and Pitongatan were taken to the prison of this court, each and every one of them swore, after their fashion, to help one another with their persons and property in all matters--be it concerning the liberty of their slaves, or in any other difficulty"

Likewise, it appears that after they left the said prison, the said Don Martin Panga was exiled from the village of Tondo for a certain period, and went to live in the village of Tambobo, not far from this city. There he and Don Agustin de Legaspi in vited the other leaders to come to gether for a secret meeting. Under pretext of visiting said Don Martin Panga, a meeting was held in the said village by Don Phelipe Salalila, Don Agustin Manuguit; Magat Salamat, chief of Tondo; Don Pedro Bolingui, chief of Pandaca; Don Geronimo Basi and Don Grabiel Tuam Basar, Don Agustin's brothers; Don Luis Amanicalao and Calao his son; the brothers Don Dionisio Capolo and Don Phelipe Salonga; Don Phelipe Amarlangagui, chief of Catangalan; Don Francisco Acta and Amaghicon; with other Indian timaguas, servants, and allies of his. For three days they met, and drank after their fashion. During this time, they resolved to act in harmony and with one mind in everything. If their slaves demanded liberty, they were to help one another against them; for already they were not regarded or obeyed as before. They possessed neither slaves nor gold, and found the mselves poor and cast down, ready to go to prison any day. Their sorrow was very keen because their wives were being taken away from them, and given to others to whom, they claimed, they had been first married. For all these reasons they were very sad, and they discussed and plotted, and took oath, according to their custom, that if an enemy came to Manila to at tack the Spaniards, they would unanimously and with one mind aid the enemy against the Spaniards. Thus, they would once more become masters, as they had been before, and exercise the old tyranny over the common people--who now were much favored by the Spaniards, being promoted to superior places by them. The said Don Agustin de Legaspi proposed to them the plan and compact which he had made with the said Japanese Don Joan Payo [Gayo]; and the other chiefs declared that they were ready to help him and to accede to his wishes. After this, it appears that in the month of February, one thousand five hundred and eighty-eight, when we heard of the English pirate who passed through these islands and plundered the ship \"Santana,\" the said chiefs made preparations, thinking he would come to this city, to carry out their plan. A few days afterward, Don Estevan Taes, chief of Bulacan, came to the village of Tondo where they were. He conferred with Don Martin Panga; and they decided that since the Englishman had not come, and the compact made at the meeting of Tambobo had not been carried out, they should call another meeting to discuss what had been planned at the for mer one. To this end, he of fered to notify and call to gether all the chiefs from his village as far as Tondo, while Don Martin Panga was to summon the other chiefs as far as Cavite. To this end, the said Don Martin Panga said that he would carry a letter to the governors of Malolos and Guiguinto, and tell them to hasten to the meeting; and that, when they were assembled, he could 53 communicate to them the bad or the good which he kept within his breast. After Don Esteban Tael had told him to leave the matter in his hands, Don Martin Panga declared, in the presence of Pitongatan, that he and Don Agustin had planned to call to gether the men of La Laguna and Comitan; and that, when the people were all gathered, they would discuss the means of regaining the freedom and lordship which their fathers had enjoyed before them; and, with all the people collected at Tondo, would at tack Manila, as arranged with Balaya, chief of Vangos, and with the natives of Batan. It seems that the said meeting did not take place, on account of various occupations which detained the said chiefs. Moreover, it appears that about the same time, when certain Indian chiefs of Panpanga came to Manila on business connected with their province, on passing through the village of Tondo, Don Agustin Panga summoned them; and he, to gether with Don Agustin de Legaspi, Sagat Malagat, and Amanicalao, talked with them, and in quired after the business that took them to Manila. The chiefs answered that they came to entreat the governor to command the cessation of the lawsuits concerning slaves in Panpanga, until they could gather in the harvest. Don Martin said that this was very good, and that they also wished to make the same entreaty and to bring their slaves to court; but that to at tain this it would be best to assemble and choose a leader from among them, whom they should swear to obey in everything as a king, in or der that none should act alone. The chiefs of Panpanga said that they had [no] war with the Spaniards, to cause them to plot against the latter, and that they had a good king. Thus, they did not consent to what was asked from them by the aforesaid chiefs, and proceeded to Manila in or der to transact their business. In Manila they were again in vited to go to Tondo, to take food with the plotters; but the Panpanga chiefs refused. On the same day a meeting was held in Tondo by Don Agustin de Legaspi and Don Martin Panga; Don Luis Balaya, chief of Bangos; Agustin Lea and Alonso Digma, his nephews; Don Phelipe Salalila and Don Agustin Manuguit, his son; Don Luis Amanicalao, and Calao, his son; Don Grabiel Tuambacar, Don Francisco Acta, Don Phelipe Salonga, and other natives who rendered service. While they were thus assembled, they all resolved and agreed, amid the usual drinking, that the above-ment ioned Magat should go to the Calamianes and from that place notify the Borneans to come to Manila to at tack the Spaniards; and the chiefs would wait for them here, and would take care to receive and help them"

In fulfilment of this, the said chief Magat Salamat went to the Calamianes, which are near the kingdom of Burney, taking with him the chiefs Don Agustin Manuguit and Don Joan Banal. Thence he went to the island of Cuyo, where it seems that he discussed the matter with Sumaelob, chief of the said island, and persuaded him to come with the Borneans to plunder Manila. At that time, he was arrested for this trial, was brought to this city, and openly confessed that what has been said actually occurred. The said in quiries and in vestigations made in reference to the trial of the aforesaid persons were examined by the governor and captain-general; and he gave or ders to arrest those who appeared guilty, in the various regions and provinces in which they were to be found, and on different days, letting no one of the guilty ones escape. The men were arrested and their confessions were taken down separately. At the proper time and place they were each charged with the crime which resulted against each of them; and a copy of the charge was given to them and to their at to rneys on their behalf. Their cases were received on trial 54 in a certain or der and for a certain period, so as to give them, during that period, an opportunity of clearing the mselves from the charge. The time expired, and the trial was definitely closed. The governor and captain-general reviewed the trial, and on different days pronounced a final sentence against each one of them, according to their guilt. The sentence is in substance as follows: Don Agustin de Legaspi and Don Martin Panga, as leaders and chiefs, and being convicted by witnesses, were condemned to be dragged and hanged; their heads were to be cut off and exposed on the gibbet in iron cages, as an example and warning against the said crime. All their goods were to be confiscated and set apart, half for the royal treasury and half for judicial expenses. The above-ment ioned appealed from the aforesaid sentence to the royal Audiencia of these islands; but after having examined the trial, the Audiencia confirmed the aforesaid sentence, and returned the case to the governor and captain-general in or der that justice might be done. The death-punishment was to cut their heads off and to expose them on the gibbet in iron cages. The sites of their houses were to be plowed and sown with salt. All their property, after the judicial expenses had been defrayed, should be set aside for the royal treasury. This sentence was executed upon the abovementioned persons as here stated. 55 Insurrections by Filipinos in the Seventeenth Century This is an excerpt of an account by various 17 th century chroniclers and collected by Blair and Robertson in Volume 38 of The Philippine Islands, Pp. 87-240. The reading discusses two rebellions led by the Babaylan Tamblot and the old chief of Limasawa Bankaw. The account shows the struggles of our ancestors to preserve their beliefs and traditions against the on slaught of Spanish Christianization. Naturally, the Spaniards would portray their efforts as the efforts of the devil to lead the people to apostasy and rebellion. Also in cluded is the account of Pedro Ladia’s rebellion centered in Malolos, Bulacan. Being much of a religious rebellion, Ladia would also at tempt to establish a kingdom based on the Tagalog area in which Malolos is a part. Excerpt: The majority of the ministers in the island of Bohol had gone to Zebu, to celebrate the feasts of the beatification of St. Xavier; in their absence Lucifer at tempted to possess himself again of those souls. The divata, or demon, appeared to some Indians in the woods—its face covered, like that of one taking the discipline—and commanded them to quit the gospel ministers and the Spanish vassalage, and take refuge in the hills; and to build him a chapel, where he would aid them and give them whatever they needed to pass their lives in happiness and abundance, with out the encumbrance of paying tribute to the Spaniards or dues to the churches. Two or three Indians, who on account of their evil deeds were wandering as fugitives, became priests of this divata, in or der to persuade the people to apostasy and rebellion; and, to take away the fear which they naturally feel to ward the Spaniards, these priests told them that, if they would at tack the Spaniards, the divata would cause the mountains to rise against their foe; that the muskets of the latter would not go off, or else the bullets would rebound on those who fired them; that if any Indian should die, the demon would resuscitate him; that the leaves of the trees would be converted into saranga (which is a large fish); that when they cut bejucos, these would distill wine in stead of water; that from the banana-leaves they would make fine linen; and, in short, that all would be pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. With these magnificent promises, so at tractive to men—and especially to the Indians, who are so in clined to idleness and sloth—four villages revolted; only Loboc (which is the chief village) and Baclayon remained firm in the faith, and in loyalty to the king. Information of this reached Zebu, and immediately Don Juan de Alcarazo, alcalde-mayor of Zebu, went to quiet the island; he in vited them to make peace, for which the rebels did not care. Their boldness in creasing, they burned the four villages and their churches; they flung on the ground the rosaries and crosses, and pierced an image of the blessed Virgin eighteen times with javelins—although afterward in Zebu some tried to make amends to her with the most affectionate demonstrations of reverence, and she was placed in our church. Thereupon the chief 56 or dered troops from Zebu, fifty Spaniards and a thousand friendly Indians, accompanied by a father; and on New Year’s Day, 1622, he began the march to the mountains, where the in surgents were"

Thereupon the chief 56 or dered troops from Zebu, fifty Spaniards and a thousand friendly Indians, accompanied by a father; and on New Year’s Day, 1622, he began the march to the mountains, where the in surgents were. For five days they traveled through rugged hills and deep ravines, crossing marshes where the mud came to their knees, or even to their waists, and shedding their blood on the thorns and briars. On the fifth day, the in surgents killed a friendly Indian; this they celebrated with loud shouts, and it greatly in creased their arrogance. On the following day, more than 1,500 rebel Indians at tacked our vanguard, which consisted of sixteen Spaniards and three hundred Indians; but when our muskets were fired so many fell dead that the rebels began to retreat to a bamboo thicket. When we followed them, a heavy rain fell, which encouraged the rebels, for they said that our muskets were then useless. But Heaven favored our cause with a marvel, since, although the pans of the musket-locks were full of water, the soldiers declared that the powder never failed to catch fire, nor did the matches go out. At this the rebels fled into the mountains; and our men arrived at a village of more than a thousand houses, in the midst of which was the temple of their divata. Our troops found there much food, various jewels of silver and gold, and many bells of the sort those people use—all which was given to our Indians. The rebels were in a for tification of stone, in which they had placed many stones and clods of earth to throw at our men; but the latter, covering the mselves with their shields, seized the redoubt, with the death of many of the enemy, and in a for tnight returned to Loboc. Captain Alcarazo, who was for emost in all these engagements, commanded that some of the rebels be hanged, and published a pardon to the rest; and he returned to Zebu, where the victory was celebrated. This success had very important results, for it checked the revolt of other islands and other villages—who were expecting the favorable result which the demon had promised them, so that they could shake off the mild yoke of Christ, and with it their vassalage to the Spaniards. Many of them, now undeceived, accepted the pardon; but others, who were stubborn, for tified the mselves at the summit of a rugged and lofty hill, difficult of access, and closed the road [to it] with brambles and thorns. They also filled the paths with very sharp stakes driven into the soil, and placed among the branches of the trees many crossbows, in or der that these, being discharged as our men passed them, might wound the soldiers; and above they provided many stones to throw at the Spaniards, hurling them from the top of the hill. Six months later the same Don Juan Alcarazo returned, to dislodge those rebels with forty Spaniards and many Indians. After suffering great hardships in making the paths accessible, nearly all his men were hurt, by the time they reached the fort, by the many stones which the enemy hurled down from the summit; but our soldiers courageously climbed the ascent, firing their muskets, and killed many of the rebels, putting the rest to flight. Thus, was dispersed that sedition, which was one of the most dangerous that had occurred in the islands— not only because the Boholanos were the most warlike and valiant of the Indians, but on account of the conspiracy spreading to many other tribes. Noble examples of fidelity in this great disturbance are not lacking. The natives of Carigara in the island of Leyte became impatient, and revolted with out waiting for the result in Bohol, in cited the reto by Bancao, the ruling chief of Limasava—who in the year 57 1565 received with friendly welcome Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and the Spaniards who came to his island, supplying them with what they needed, for which Phelipe II sent him a royal decree, thanking him for the kind hospitality which he showed to those first Spaniards. He was baptised and, although a young man, showed that he was loyal to the Christians; but, conquered by the enemy [of souls], he changed sides in his old age. This man lived in the island of Leyte, and with a son of his and another man, Pagali (whom he chose as priest of his idolatry), erected a sacred place to the divata, or devil; and they in duced six villages in the island to rebel. In or der to remove from them their fear of the Spaniards, these men told their followers that they could change the Spaniards into stones as soon as they saw them, by repeating the word bato, which signifies “stone;” and that a woman or a child could change them into clay by flinging earth upon them. Father Melchor de Vera went to Zebu to give warning of this sedition and obtain aid to check it. Captain Alcarazo equipped an armada of forty vessels, in which were embarked some Spaniards and many friendly Indians, also the father rector of Zebu and Father Vera; these united with the for ces (both Spanish and Indian) that the alcalde of Leyte had. They of fered peace to the rebels, but the latter spurned it with contempt. Our men, divided into three bodies, at tacked them; and, when that which Don Juan de Alcarazo commanded came in sight of the rebels, they fled to the hills. Our soldiers followed them, and on the way put to the sword or shot those whom they encountered; and, although the compassion of the Spaniards spared the children and women, these could not escape the fury of the Indians. Many of the rebels died, the enchantment not availing them by which they had thought to turn the Spaniards into stone or clay; the rest saved the mselves by flight. The Spaniards came to a large building which the rebels had erected for their divata; they encamped in it ten days, and then burned it.

To in spire greater terror, the captain gave or ders to shoot three or four rebels, and to burn one of their priests—in or der that, by the light of that fire, the blindness in which the divata had kept them deluded might be removed. The Spaniards also cut off the head of an Indian who had robbed Father Vinancio [i. e., Vilancio] and broken to pieces an image of the Virgin, and kicked a crucifix; and his head was set up in the same place where he had committed those horrible sacrileges. There were many who, in the midst of so furious a tempest, remained constant in their religious belief. This fearful earthquake was general in all these Filipinas, although it was more severe in some regions than in others—for in the province of Cagayán, in [the land of] one people called Maynanes, a great mountain was cleft open; and the havoc made by it extended as far as Maluco. In the heights of Gapang, in the province of Pampanga, it was very severe, and lasted several days. Even greater damage might have been done by an uprising that was plotted by an Indian of evil disposition in the villages of Gapang, Santor, Caranglán, and Patabangán, exhorting the 58 natives there to rebel and restore the mselves to their for mer liberty, by slaying the Spaniards and the religious. He assured them that in Manila there were no Spaniards left, because the earth had swallowed them, with the entire city, on the night of the earthquake that occurred on St. Andrew’s day; and that the demon, with whom he had compact and in tercourse, had promised him that he would aid the natives so that they might maintain the mselves with out paying tribute, and might enjoy much prosperity, and provided that they would slay the fathers and burn the churches. The delusion of the Indians of Gapang went so far that they seized arms, and summoned to their aid many heathen Zambals, and burned the churches of Santor and Pantabangán. When this was known in Manila, the encomendero of those villages, Admiral Rodrigo de Mesa, of fered his services to pacify them, and went to Gapang with Alférez Callejas, their collectors of tribute, and some friendly Indians; but the in surgents, who now were numerous, badly wounded the encomendero, who fled on horseback, and a year later died from that wound at Manila. They slew Alférez Callejas and many of the loyal Indians who went in his company, and for tified the mselves in the mountains. The prior and minister, Fray Juan Cabello, escaped by the aid of some other Indians who were not of the hostile party, came to Manila, and gave in for mation of the progress of the rebellion. Opinions differed as to the methods which should be employed in pacifying the in surgents; and our father provincial, Fray Alonso Carbajal, decided to send the father lecturer Fray Juan de Abarca, a religious for whom the natives of that district had much affection and respect, since he had been their minister for many years. With this commission this religious set out for Pampanga, taking with him a companion, Master-of- camp Don Agustin Songsong, a valiant Pampango, with as many soldiers of that people as seemed necessary. They arrived at Gapang, and by means of father Fray Juan de Abarca’s preaching and his earnest efforts—which would take too long to relate, as would the many perils of death to which he exposed himself—that sedition was finally quelled, and the in surgents returned to their for mer quiet. But the Indian sorcerer, the cause of this disturbance, did not make his appearance, notwithstanding all the efforts that were made to find him. Another rebellion, which threatened a great outbreak, was checked (in the year 1643) by father Fray Cristobal Enriquez. In the district of Malolos in the province of Bulacán, an Indian named Don Pedro Ladía, a native of Borney, went about promoting sedition; he proclaimed that to him belonged the right of being king over the provinces of Tagalos, alleging that he was a descendant of Raja Matanda, the petty king whom the Spaniards found at Manila in the year 1571. With these and other impostures, aided by wine—the chief counselor in matters of policy and war, among those natives—and with the consultations with the demon which always figure on these occasions, he kept many villages of that district disquieted. But the sagacious procedure of father Fray Cristobal Enriquez in tercepted all these misfortunes which were threatening us, by furnishing a plan for the arrest of Don Pedro Ladía—who already was styling himself “king of the Tagálogs;” he was sent to Manila, where, he paid with his life for his vain presumption. And thus, this revolt, lacking even that weak foundation, was entirely quieted. 59 La Democracia The following document is a decree published in the Manila newspaper La Democracia which is the or gan of the Partido Federal, on November 25, 1901.

It reiterates that the friars usurped not only the lands of in dividuals, but those of the State. Excerpt: To the president and auditors of my royal Audiencia of the Filipinas Islands, resident in the city of Manila: Don Pedro Enriquez, an auditor of that same Audiencia, made a report, with sworn statements of his proceedings; of what he had done under the commission which was conferred on him by the government there for the pacification of the villages of Taguig, Hagonoy, Parañaque, Bacoor, Cavite el Viejo, and other places at tached to them which lie near that capital, all which had revolted. [He reported that] they were pacified by merely the proclamation of a general pardon (except to the chief in stigators of the revolt) which he published, and by the promise that their complaints should be heard and justice done to them; but the village of San Mateo also revolted, and he proceeded to its punishment and left it in ruins, because the people had not surrendered their arms; it was, however, already [re]peopled, with in habitants who were more numerous and of more peaceable disposition. A similar in surrection or revolt occurred in most of the villages of the province of Bulacan, and these, like the for mer, by an agreement which they had for med by a public writing with the village of Silang protested, as they afterward made evident in their petitions, against the in juries which the Indians received from the managers of the estates which are owned by the religious of St. Dominic and those of St. Augustine, both calced and discalced—usurping the lands of the Indians, with out leaving them the freedom of the rivers for their fishing, or allowing them to cut wood for their necessary use, or even to collect the wild fruits; nor did they allow the natives to pasture on the hills near their villages the carabaos which they used for agriculture. Accordingly [the said auditor] determined to free them from these oppressions, and decided that they should not pay various unjust taxes which the managers exacted from them. Having proved to be capable in the other task assigned him, he received a commission as subdelegate judge of the adjustment of land-titles, in consequence of which he demanded from the aforesaid religious or ders the titles of ownership for the lands which they possessed; and, notwithstanding the resistance that they made to him, repeatedly refusing [to obey], he distributed to the villages the lands which the or ders had usurped, and all which they held with out legitimate cause he declared to be crown lands [realengas]—as occurred with the convent of San Pablo, belonging to the calced religious of St. Augustine, assigning to it [i. e., the crown] a farm for horned cattle and two caballerías of land which were supposed to belong to it, according to the testimony of the village of San Mateo. He also took other measures which seemed to him proper for the in vestigation of the fraudulent proceedings in the 60 measurement of the lands in the estate of Biñan, which is owned by the religious of St. Dominic —fraud which was committed in the year 1743 by the court clerk of that Audiencia [of Manila] with notable fraud and trickery, in which participated the two surveyors (appointed through ignorance or evil in tent), to the grave in jury of the village of Silang. This had caused the disturbances, revolts, and losses which had been experienced in the above-ment ioned villages. The aforesaid proceedings [by the auditor] were considered and examined with the closest at tention in my Council of the Indias, with the decrees that were also sent by the Audiencia there in the course of the proceedings in a second appeal in terposed by the village of Silang—decrees obtained in that suit by the natives of that village against the college of Santo Tomas de Aquino, in regard to lands usurped [from them] and annexed to the estate of Biñan, which the religious own. On the subject of the disturbance among the aforesaid Indians, Governor Don Gaspar de la Torre, his successor the bishop of Nueva Segovia, and the provincials of the aforesaid religious or ders set forth the allegations made in the name of the or ders by father Fray Miguel Vivas as their procurator-general at this court, and by Father Pedro Altamirano, who acts in that capacity for the Society of Jesus for its provinces of the Indias (on the point that the province of San Ignacio in those islands had no share in the commotions in those villages, as was shown by various testimonies), and the explanations made by my fiscal, who was cognizant of the whole matter. It has the refore appeared expedient to me to advise you of the receipt of your letters of July 30, 1745, and July 17, 1746, and of the acts which accompany them; and to notify you that by a despatch of this date I approve, and regard as just and proper, all that was performed by the aforesaid Don Pedro Calderon Enriquez in virtue of the commission and appointment which was conferred upon him by Governor Don Gaspar de la Torre by the advice of the Audiencia there, in or der that he might proceed to the pacification of the in surgent villages in the jurisdictions of Silang, Imus and San Nicolas, Cavite el Viejo, and the other districts which united on account of the controversy over the ownership of the lands which the religious—Dominicans, and both calced and discalced Augustinians—are endeavoring to keep. I also give him thanks for the judicious conduct and measures which he employed for the aforesaid pacification; and I likewise approve what he accomplished as subdelegate judge of the settlement of land-titles, in regard to the survey and boundaries of the estates which, in accordance with their legitimate titles, belong to each of those or ders, in view of the more accurate and reliable in for mation [obtained] from the in terpretations of the four surveyors whom he appointed—the latter bearing in mind, to this end, the measures put into execution by the auditor Ozaeta in the year 1699, in accordance with the chart printed by the pilot Bueno, in his book entitled Navegación especulativa y practica [i. e., “Navigation, the or etical and practical”] (which chart serves in those islands as the standard for the surveys)—assigning to the aforesaid religious that which belongs to them by their [legal] titles, which is the same that was or dained in the executory decree dispatched by the Audiencia there"

Although [sc., after?] the lands had been measured and a chart of the estates had been drawn, the computations were made by the said Monroy, and the surveyors signed it, supposing that it was correct; but it was acknowledged that in that same year, later, another survey and adjustment of boundaries was made by the aforesaid court clerk and one of the said surveyors on some lands over which there were lawsuits—some, in particular, with the religious of St. Augustine—in which survey there was assigned to each cattle-farm 3,024,574 square brazas of land, this being different from the previous survey, which was computed at 8,695,652 brazas. In this was proved the fraud with which the said Monroy acted, in giving to the said religious more than half of the land which belonged to Silang. Accordingly, it has appeared to me proper to condemn him to two years’ suspension from his of fice, and to lay upon him a fine of two thousand pesos, applied to the fund of fines paid into the royal treasury; and for this exaction there is issued, on this same date, the proper despatch to the Marqués de Regalía, a minister of the said my Council and tribunal of the Indias, and exclusive judge of rents, settlement of land-titles, and collection of fines and condemnations. By another despatch of the same date, the government of those islands is commanded to exercise hereafter the utmost vigilance in or der that the Indians of the said villages may not be molested by the religious, and that the latter shall be kept in check in the unjust acts which they may in future at tempt against not only those Indians but other natives of those islands. In this, the government must always bear in mind the reiterated commands given in the laws [of the empire], and the frequent royal decrees that have been issued, to the end that the Indians shall be well treated and shall not suffer oppression or extortion; and shall direct that my fiscal there shall appear as their representative and in their defense on every occasion which shall present itself in this regard. Considering how important it is that the Indians shall know of the recourse which they can have when they are oppressed or ill-treated, and in their controversies, it would be very expedient that the government give them in for mation of this, so that they may not be ignorant the reof, and that they may use these [peaceable] means with out going to the extreme, as they did on this occasion, by employing armed force. For this time, my royal charity and clemency overlooks their proceedings, considering their heedless disposition; but when they shall have been advised of what they ought to do in such cases, and in others of a different nature, if they fail to use those means they shall be chastised with the utmost severity.

The abolition of the galleon trade in 1815 and the establishment of an export-or iented, cash crop economy led to important economic, political, and socio-cultural transformations that immensely affected the colony. For example, owing to the Philippines’ engagement in the in ternational market, economic opportunities were no longer limited to certain privileged sectors from the government and the church. Some groups of in dios naturales had also benefitted from these developments, which, led to their upward socio-economic mobility. They became the “middle class,” who, through their recently-acquired wealth, was able to send their children to Europe to study. Economic development in society, however, was uneven. The majority of the population, mostly belonging to the laboring classes, still lived in material deprivation, and of tentimes found it difficult to fulfil their pecuniary obligations to the state.

A Visit to the Philippine Islands. London: Smith, Elder & Co, 202-212. The Author and His Work A Visit to the Philippine Islands is an account written by Sir John Bowring about his brief sojourn to the Philippines in 1858, while mourning the recent loss of his wife. Bowring, who served as British Consul at Canton (1849) and, later, governor of Hong Kong (1854-1859), wrote about his of ficial travel to the Spanish colony in 1859, and published it in the same year. His seven-week tour on the steam-powered paddle frigate Magicienne covered several areas which in cluded Manila, Laguna, and Tayabas. In A Visit to the Philippines (comprising 27 chapters in to tal), he presented an engaging narration of the political, economic, and socio-cultural life the Philippines from the time the Spaniards first set foot on the islands until the early decades of the nineteenth century. It is evident that in addition to his own in sightful observations, he also used English and Spanish published materials to enrich his account. The particular text below, taken from the Chapter 12 (Ecclesiastical Authority) of the book, discusses the authority of the Church over the colonized populations, the sources and basis of this authority, and how it was liberally exercised by the different religious groups and congregations in the Philippines. Text It cannot be denied that, in the language of Tomas de Comyn, “the missionaries were the real 1 conquerors of the Philippines; their arms were not, in deed, those of the warrior, but they gave laws to millions, and, scattered though they were, they established by unity of purpose and of action a permanent empire over immense multitudes of men.” Up to the present hour there are probably few parishes in which the gobernadorcillo, having received a mandate from the civil 2 authority, fails to consult the friar, and the efficiency and activity of the Indian functionary in 3 giving effect to the mandate will much depend on the views the padre may take of the or ders issued. The opulence of the in dividual monks, and of some of the monkish fraternities in the islands, has of ten and naturally been a subject of reproach. The revenues received by in dividuals are in many localities very large, amounting in remote districts to eight or nine thousand dollars a year, and much more, it is reported, in such populous pueblos as Binondo. Some of these communities 4 also possess large tracts of land, whose management is superintended at periodical meetings held in the capital, when friars from the different provinces, and of the same brotherhood, are summoned to give an account of their stewardship, and to discuss the general in terests of the referring to Tomas de Comyn who wrote The State of the Philippines in 1810. 1 head of a town 2 or “in dios naturales,” referring to the native in habitants of the Philippines 3 pueblos or to wns 4 65 fraternity. The accumulations of the friars pass to the convents at their death, but they have little difficulty in disposing of them while living. It has been said that the policy of the friars in the Philippines is to conduct the Indian to heaven by a pathway of flowers. Little molestation will he experience from his ghostly father, if he be strict in his religious observances, pay his regular contributions to Church and State, and exhibit those outward marks of respect and reverence which the representatives of the Deity claim as their lawful heritage; but there are many thorns amidst the flowers, and drawbacks, on the heavenly road; and the time may come when higher and nobler aspirations than those which now satisfy the poor untutored, or little tutored, Indian, will be his rule of conduct. The personal courtesies, the kind reception and multifarious at tentions which I received from the friars in every part of the Philippines naturally dispose me to look upon them with a friendly eye. I found among them men worthy of being loved and honoured, some of considerable in tellectual vigour; but literary cultivation and scientific acquirements are rare. Occupied with their own concerns, they are little acquainted with mundane affairs. Politics, geography, history, have no charms for those who, even had they the disposition for study, would, in their seclusion and remoteness, have access to few of its appliances. Their convents are almost palatial, with extensive courts, grounds and gardens; their revenues frequently enormous. Though their mode of life is generally unostentatious and simple, many of them keep handsome carriages and have the best horses in the locality; and they are surrounded generally by a prostrate and superstitious population, upon whose hopes and fears, thoughts and feelings, they exercise an in fluence which would seem magical were it not by their devotees deemed divine. This in fluence, no doubt, is greatly due to the heroism, labours, sufferings and sacrifices of the early missionaries, and to the admirably or ganized hierarchy of the Roman Church, whose ramifications reach to the extremest points in which any of the forms or semblances of Christianity are to be discovered"

V olumes upon volumes—the folio records of the proceedings of the different religious or ders, little known to Protestant readers—fill the library shelves of these Catholic establishments, which are the receptacles of their religious history. A source of in fluence possessed by the friars, and from which a great majority of civil functionaries are excluded, is the mastery of the native languages. All the in troductory studies of ecclesiastical aspirants are dedicated to this object. No doubt they have great advantages from living habitually among the Indian people, with whom they keep up the most uninterrupted in tercourse, and of whose concerns they have an in timate knowledge. One of the most obvious means of in creasing the power of the civil departments would be in encouragement given to their functionaries for the acquirement of the native idioms. I believe Spanish is not employed in the pulpits anywhere beyond the capital. In many of the pueblos there is not a single in dividual Indian who understands Castilian, so that the priest is of ten the only link between the government and the community, and, as society is now or ganized, a necessary link. It must be recollected, too, that the different members of the religious brotherhoods are bound to gether by stronger bonds and a more potent and in fluential or ganization than any of ficial hierarchy among civilians; and the government can expect no co-operation from the priesthood in any measures which tend to the diminution of ecclesiastical authority or jurisdiction, and yet the subjection of that authority to the State, and its limitation wherever it in terferes with the public well-being, is 66 the great necessity and the all-important problem to be solved in the Philippines. But here, too, the Catholic character of the government itself presents an enormous and almost in vincible difficulty. Nothing is so dear to a Spaniard in general as his religion; his or thodoxy is his pride and glory, and upon this foundation the Romish Church naturally builds up a political power and is able to in tertwine its pervading in fluence with all the machinery of the civil government. 67 Tomas de Comyn. [1810] 1917. State of the Philippines in 1810. In The Former Philippines Thru Foreign Eyes, edited by Austin Craig, pp. 357- 458. New York: D. Appleton and Company. The State of the Philippines in 1810 was written by Tomas de Comyn, who served, for 5 several years, as general manager of the Royal Philippine Company, a chartered company established in 1785. Comyn had at least three main purposes in writing this text. First, to 6 describe the political, economic, and socio-cultural aspects of Philippine life during the first decade of the nineteenth century. Second, to examine the pressing issues at the time, such as Moro at tacks, corruption in the government, and in eptitude of public of ficials that, for him, impeded economic progress. Finally, to call public at tention to the current state of the colony so that the government could devise a plan to advance the islands’ development. His work did not evoke the at tention he hoped to capture. However, it is still an important historical source as it presents a general overview of the Philippine condition a few years before the abolition of the galleon and the opening of the colony to in ternational trade. The 7 specific passage below deals with land ownership, as well as the various concerns related to it, and Comyn’s view on how the state could remedy these issues. Excerpt: Estates. The proprietors of estates in the Philippines are of four classes. The most considerable is that of the religious or ders, Augustinians and Dominicans, who cultivate their respective lands on joint account, or let them out at a moderate ground-rent, which the planters pay in kind; but far from living in opulence, and accumulating the immense revenues some of the religious communities enjoy in America, they stand in need of all they earn and possess for their 8 maintenance, and in or der to be enabled to discharge the various duties and obligations annexed to the missions with which they are entrusted. Spanish planters. The second class comprehends the Spanish proprietors, whose number possibly does not exceed a dozen of persons, and even they labor under such disadvantages, and have to contend with so many obstacles, under the existing or der of things, that, compelled to divide their lands into rice plantations, in consequence of this being the species of culture to Tomas de Comyn.

Aids to agriculture. It will beyond doubt, in some measure dissipate the distrust by which the Filipino is actuated, when the new and paternal exertions of the superior government, to ameliorate his present situation, are fully known, and when that valuable portion of our distant population is assured that their rights will henceforth be respected, and those exactions and compulsory levies which for merly so much disheartened them, are to tally abolished. On the other hand, a new stimulus will be given by the living example and fresh impulse communicated to the provinces by other families emigrating and settling there, nurtured in the spirit and principles of those reforms in the ideas and maxims of government by which the present era is distinguished. A practical participation in these advantages will, most assuredly, awaken a spirit of enterprise and emulation that may be extremely beneficial to agriculture, and as the wants of the natives in crease in proportion as they are enabled to know and compare the comforts arising out of the presence and extension of conveniences and luxuries in their own to wns, they will naturally be led to possess and adopt them. Plans for progress. So salutary a change, however, can only be the work of time, and as long as the government confines itself to a system merely protecting, the effects must consequently be slow. As it is the refore necessary to put in action more powerful springs than the or dinary ones, it will be found expedient partly to relax from some of those general principles which apply to societies, differently constituted, or rather for med of other perfectly distinct elements. As relating to the subject under discussion, I for tunately discover two means, pointed out in the laws the mselves, essentially just, and at the same time capable of producing in this populous colony, more than in any other, the desired results. The legislator, founding himself on the common obligation of the subject to contribute something in return for the protection he receives, and to co-operate in the in crease of the power and opulence of the State, proscribes idleness as a crime, and points out labor as a duty; and although the regulations to uching the natives breathe the spirit of humanity, and exhibit the wisdom with which they were or iginally for med, they nevertheless concur and are directed to this primary object. In them the distribution of vacant lands, as well as of the natives at fair daily wages to clear them, is universally allowed, and these it seems to me, During the nineteenth century, the term “Filipino” was used to refer to Philippine-born Spanish 9 residents in the colony. In the 1880 s, the Propagandists appropriated this term for the mselves. Comyn was referring to Spanish conquerors such as Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who arrived in the 10 Philippines in the sixteenth century. 69 are the means from an equitable and in telligent application of which the most beneficial consequences may be expected. Confiscating unused lands. The first cannot be at tended with any great difficulty, because all the provinces abound in waste and vacant lands, and scarcely is there a district in which some are not to be found of private property completely uncultivated and neglected, and consequently susceptible, as above stated, of being legally transferred, for this reason alone, to the possession of an active owner. Let their nature however, be what it may, in their adjudication, it is of the greatest importance to proceed with uniformity, by consecrating, in a most irrevocable manner, the solemnity of all similar grants. Public in terest and reason, in the Philippine Islands, require that in all such cases deference only should be paid to demands justly in terposed, and for mally established within a due and fixed period; but after full and public notice has been given by the respective judicial authorities, of the titles about to be granted, the counter claims the natives may seek to put in after the lapse of the period prefixed, should be peremptorily disregarded. Although at first sight this appears a direct in fringement on the imprescriptible rights of property, it must be considered that in some cases in dividual in terests ought to be sacrificed to the general good, and that the balance used, when treating of the affairs of State, is never of that rigid kind as if applied to those of minor consideration. The fact is, that by this means many would be in duced to form estates, who have hitherto been with held by the dread of in volving the mselves, and spending their money in law suits; at the same time the natives, gradually accustoming the mselves to this new or der of things, would lay aside that disposition to strife and contention, which forms so peculiar a trait in their character, and that antipathy and odium would also disappear with which they have usually viewed the agricultural undertakings of Spaniards. 70 Del Pilar, Marcelo H. 1888.

The following work by Del Pilar, “Aba Guinoong Baria,” is a satire found in a collection called Dasalan at Tocsohan, which was said to have been co-written by Pedro Serrano Laktaw and Rafael Enriquez. The short poem, along with others like it in the collection, illustrates the avariciousness of friars in the Philippines. It drives home the point Del Pilar aimed to express: that the corruption of Philippine society can be blamed on the greed of the friars.

On the 20 th year anniversary of the execution of the three priests, Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez, and Jacinto Zamora, the newspaper La Solidaridad published Edmund Plauchut’s account of the execution. The first hand account by the Frenchman resident of Manila was or iginally published in the French journal, Revue des Deux Mondes in 1877. Plauchut’s account has of ten been called “the Filipino version” of the events that transpired in 1872. The historian John N. Schumacher, however, found the account problematic, citing in consistencies in statements and the lack of knowledge on background events in the Philippines. Schumacher also contended that it was not clear whether Plauchut was really in the Philippines during the period of 1869 to 1873. This only led Schumacher to believe that it was highly likely that the account written by Plauchut was itself in spired and aided by at least one political prisoner, Antonio Regidor, who was imprisoned after the events of 1872. Therefore, while the “Filipino version” of the events of 1872 may contain biases to wards the Filipinos, it should be read in the context of early propaganda efforts. The account published in La Solidaridad may in deed be “dramatic” according to Schumacher, but the motives behind the writing of such an account contributes knowledge on the workings of a propaganda efforts that preceded even Rizal’s generation. Excerpt: Late in the night of the 15 th of February 1872, a Spanish court martial found three secular priests, Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora, guilty of treason as the in stigators of a mutiny in the Kabite navy-yard a month before, and sentenced them to death. The judgement of the court martial was read to the priests in Fort Santiago early in the next morning and they were told it would be executed the following day… Upon hearing the sentence, Burgos broke into sobs, Zamora lost his mind and never recovered it, and only Gomez listened impassively, an old man accustomed to the thought of death. When dawn broke on the 17 th of February there were almost forty thousand of Filipinos (who came from as far as Bulakan, Pampanga, Kabite and Laguna) surrounding the four platforms where the three priests and the man whose testimony had convicted them, a for mer artilleryman called Saldua, would die. The three priests followed Saldua: Burgos ‘weeping like a child’, Zamora with vacant eyes, and Gomez head held high, blessing the Filipinos who knelt at his feet, heads bared and praying.

Since He wills that I should die here, His holy will be done.” Zamora went up the scaffold with out a word and delivered his body to the executioner; his mind had already left it. 73 Burgos was the last, a refinement of cruelty that compelled him to watch the death of his companions. He seated himself on the iron rest and then sprang up crying: “But what crime have I committed? Is it possible that I should die like this. My God, is there no justice on earth?” A dozen friars surrounded him and pressed him down again upon the seat of the garrote, pleading with him to die a Christian death. He obeyed but, feeling his arms tied round the fatal post, protested once again: “But I am in nocent!” “So was Jesus Christ,’ said one of the friars.” At this Burgos resigned himself. The executioner knelt at his feet and asked his for giveness. “I for give you, my son. Do your duty.” And it was done. 74 Sinibaldo de Mas, Internal Political Condition of the Philippines (1842). In Emma Blair and James Robertson (eds.), The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark, Co., 1903-1907), vol. 52, pp. 29-90. The Internal Conditions of the Philippines was a controversial report written by Sinibaldo de Mas, a Spanish of ficial in the Philippines, and diplomat in Asia in the mid-nineteenth century. This secret report was part of the third volume of Mas’ three-volume work on the Philippines. The first two volumes were on the historical background of the colony, the various challenges it was facing at the time, and its need for a more effective and efficient colonial administration. First published confidentially in Madrid in 1842, and then publicly the following year with a very few copies released, The Internal Conditions d i s c u s s e d Spain’s three in tentions with regard to the Philippines: perpetual possession, utter neglect, and emancipation. Mas focused on the first and third in tentions, although he advocated the latter (emancipation) as he “cannot see what benefits [Spain could gain] from the colonies.” The text below is part of Mas’ discussion on the three principles that would allow Spain to control the Philippines in perpetuity. The focus here is the second principle. Excerpt: In or der to conserve the colony, it is necessary, in my opinion, to work with reference to the spirit of the following three principles, which I shall endeavor successively to explain: 1 st: It is advisable to reduce the Spanish-Filipino population to the least possible number. 2 nd: The 11 people of color must voluntarily give respect and obedience to the whites. 3 rd: The general 12 13 administration demands a complete reform. … 2 nd. People of color must voluntarily respect and obey the whites. In or der to at tain this object, it is necessary to maintain the for mer race in an in tellectual and moral condition which will make of their numerical majority a political force less than that which resides in the second, just as a pile of straw in the balance weighs less than a gold nugget. The farmer or the goatherd does not read social contracts, or know more than what takes place in his own village. This is not the class of people who have overthrown absolutism in España, but that class who are educated in the 14 colleges, and who know the price of guarantees, and fight for them. We must not depart from this point of view, if we are to discuss the matter sincerely. The making of liberals must be 15 necessarily avoided, for in a colony the words liberal and in surgent are synonymous. The Insulares or Philippine-born Spaniards in the Philippines.11 Mas was referring to the native in habitants of the colony 12 These were the “white” Spaniards in the colony.13 The absolute power of a monarch 14 Educated in dividuals who advocated the recognition of the rights of the people 15 75 consequence of the idea will be to admit the principle that each step for ward is a treading backward. It is necessary to circumscribe the education to primary schools where reading, writing, and arithmetic will be taught, continuing as at present with one school in each village, and leaving their direction to the curas. The colleges for males now existing in Manila must be 16 closed.

Our aims. In La Solidaridad, vol. 1: 1889, trans. Guadalupe Fores-Ganzon, 3, 5. Pasig City: Fundación Santiago. From 1889-1895, the newspaper La Solidaridad served as the mouthpiece of propagandists seeking reforms for the Philippines. In its 7-year publication history, the newspaper published various works on politics, economics, literature, and society, all with the aim of in troducing to a wider audience an awareness of the Spanish colony known as the Philippines and the plight of its citizens under Spanish colonial rule. In its first issue on 15 February 1889, the first article pronounced the aims of the newspaper. As can be read from this source, the propagandists underscored the importance of defending progress and fighting all for ces that countered its development. This idea would serve as the basis for all succeeding efforts made by the propagandists on behalf of the Filipinos. Excerpt: Our aspirations are modest, very modest. Our program, aside from being simple, is clear: to combat reaction, to stop all retrogressive steps, to extol and adopt liberal ideas, to defend progress; in a word, to be a propagandist, above all, of democratic ideas in or der to make these supreme in all nations here and across the seas. The aims, the refore, of La Solidaridad are described as to collect, to gather, libertarian ideas which are manifested daily in the field of politics, science, art, literature, commerce, agriculture and in dustry. We shall also discuss all problems relating to the general in terest of the nation and seek solutions to those problems in high-level and democratic manner. With regard to the Philippines, since she needs the most help, not being represented in the Cortes, we shall pay particular at tention to the defense of her democratic rights, the accomplishment of which is our patriotic duty. That nation of eight million souls should not, must not be the exclusive preserve of the ocracy and traditionalism. 77 “The Causes of the Distress of the Philippines” Graciano Lopez Jaena, one of the leading figures of the Propaganda Movement, wrote “The Causes of the Distress of the Philippines” which was published in España en Filipinas in 1887. Jaena was born in Jaro Iloilo on December 18, 1856. In 1880 he left for Spain to pursue medicine but did not finish his studies as he became too in volved in journalism and politics. Lopez Jaena was particularly known for impassioned speeches and articles that dealt with the problems in the Philippines. He was also known for his anti- clerical at titude as seen in some of his writings criticizing the role of the friars in the management of the affairs in the Philippines. He became La Solidadridad’s first editor in 1889. Lopez Jaena’s “The Causes of the Distress of the Philippines” is an assessment of the problems in the Philippines. It identified the faults and shortcomings of the Spanish colonial administration particularly in education, economy, and colonial bureaucracy. The document elaborated how in effectual the colonial government is in its duties in the colony. It also criticizes the in structions in many schools which focus more on religious education than on necessary knowledge that would help in the progress of the Philippines. Lopez Jaena also made some suggestions among which is the establishment of more free ports that would benefit the colonial economy. The document cited here is an English translation of Lopez Jaena’s or iginal article compiled in Graciano Lopez Jaena: Speeches, Articles, and Letters by the National Historical Institute (NHI). Excerpt: After those ment ioned in the preceding article, the most notable cause of the backwardness of the Philippines is the anomalous education given to the youth in schools. They learn to read correctly and to write gracefully, but they do not learn useful things because they are not taught any. They are taught how to pray but never to work. In all public schools Spanish grammar is conspicuous by its absence, because certain people place obstacles to teaching the Indio Spanish, the elements of physics, chemistry, geography, and agriculture, knowledge of which is certainly useful to the future of the in dividual and the progress of the nation; but, if all these subjects are conspicuous by their absence, on the other hand, never absent are the rosary, trisagion, the thousand and one novenas of the saints, the Virgin and the martyrs with which the tender minds of the children are nourished spiritually and viciously. 78 On the kind of in struction given in the Royal and Pontifical University, the seminaries and colleges we say nothing because it would be an in exhaustible subject. The continuous change of personnel in the government is another cause of the havoc and disasters in the Philippines and in the colonies in general. Such a swift change is only comparable to the locusts which, after devastating the fields, are replaced in swift and vertiginous succession. If to this is added the in competence of the majority of the government personnel, it becomes evident that from progression to progression, the country in a short time reaches the apogee of her ruin. The fatal omission of natives from the government positions of high or average importance is its corollary: the lack of any improvement in the Philippines, the to wns remaining stagnant and backward. Since some of those who give or ders, who govern and administer are in ept and in secure in their posts, it matters little to them whether the country improves and advances or not. We are not unaware that there exist royal decrees on the filling of the government positions with natives, but the truth is these are not followed and the law and everything else about this matter are a dead letter"

Another cayuse of the ruinous condition of the Archipelago is the Mint in Manila which turns out gold and silver coins that enrich China and the British colonies rather than the Philippines. The Chinese and the British export our gold and silver, the first to their country and the other to her colonies, paying “hard premium” in Mexican silver, common in the Islands, so that it has become very difficult to obtain in Manila four-peso gold coin. The abolition of the existing differential duties, freedom of commerce, freedom of association, freedom of the press through which the Filipino may study or learn about the progress of all the branches of in dustry, commerce and agriculture for their own benefit and for that of their country, as well as how to convert China and Japan into markets for our products through the negotiation of commercial treaties with them, are the supreme remedies to reactivate and restore to life the already comatose Philippine commerce. With regard to the Chinese, in asmuch as they have already joined the convert of nations, the powers ought to compel them to mint their own coins and adopt their own monetary system, for it is not fair that they should take advantage of the specie of every country. With their present commercial methods, it is impossible to transact business and exchange with them. 79 Likewise, it is urgent to establish free ports for the benefit of the natives of the country, in asmuch as nature has created these ports for the use of the people who live in them. To go against nature is to violate natural law; it is to in fringe on the very work of God. Human justice, policy, and government should act in conformity with, never against the laws of nature. 80 Álbum de Filipinas, ca. 1870, Biblioteca Nacional de España The album is a collection of late-nineteenth-century photographs in the Philippines housed at the National Library of Spain (Biblioteca Nacional de España), Madrid, Spain. It consists of 17 portraits and 43 landscape photographs that of fer a rich source of pictorial in for mation on the socio-cultural, economic, and urban history of the last decades of Spanish rule in Manila and its nearby areas. IS The source provides a visual reconstruction and representation of the many facets of the Philippine colonial life. The different socio-economic and ethnic classes of colonial Philippines were illustrated through several portraits of the Spanish population, Spanish and Chinese mestizos, natives, other European in habitants of Manila, as well as the Negritos in the province of Pampanga. Women history, social history, and sartorial studies could be gleaned from these visual sources. Also, the album provides supplementary pictorial sources on the Philippines´ economic history in the late nineteenth century through some photos of the bustling port of Manila, the commercial activities along the Pasig river, the to bacco factory, etc. Moreover, it excellently depicts the urban built environment of the colonial capital and the dwellings found at the Pasig River's right and left bank. Manila´s colonial modernity can be in terrogated through the in novative structures and spaces in troduced in Manila during the late nineteenth-century. The catalogue shows the modernization project of the city´s port; rehabilitation of the Pasig River and surrounding estuaries; improvement of the in habitants´ mobility and communication through new bridges and paved and widened roads; and the city transformation with the in troduction of paseos and plazas for the city´s embellishment. Finally, the album can aid in discussing the Philippines´ history of disasters through photos depicting some of the destruction in the capital caused by the 1863 earthquake and the reconstruction efforts on some of the primary colonial edifices and churches in Manila. 81 TOPIC 4: 1896 Philippine Revolution List of Reading Materials: • Acta de la Proclamación • Artemio Ricarte’s Declaration • Bonifacio’s Letter to Nakpil • Bonifacio’s Letter to Jacinto • Decalogue of the Katipunan • Decree Establishing the Revolutionary Katipunan • Kartilya ng Katipunan • Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa • “Ang Dapat Mabatid” • Gregoria de Jesus 82 Introduction for the 1896 Philippine Revolution As the Philippines enter the last decade of the 19 th century, the tension between the Filipinos and the Spaniards that have been long ignored is slowly taking hold of public consciousness. This was largely in part because of the efforts of Filipino propagandists in Europe. However, while the Propaganda Movement slowly loses momentum with its failure to produce tangible reforms in the colony there was a growing number of the Filipinos who were drawn to wards the idea of in dependence. On the day of Jose Rizal’s exile to Dapitan on July 7, 1892, a revolutionary or ganization was for mally established – the Kataastaasan Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan. And in 1896, the Katipunan, under the guidance of Andres Bonifacio, spearheaded the revolution against Spain with the goal of gaining in dependence.

      "context": ". This was largely in part because of the efforts of Filipino propagandists in Europe. However, while the Propaganda Movement slowly loses momentum with its failure to produce tangible reforms in the colony there was a growing number of the Filipinos who were drawn to wards the idea of in dependence. On the day of Jose Rizal’s exile to Dapitan on July 7, 1892, a revolutionary or ganization was for mally established – the Kataastaasan Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan. And in 1896, the Katipunan, under the guidance of Andres Bonifacio, spearheaded the revolution against Spain with the goal of gaining in dependence. The selected documents trace the history of the 1896 Philippine Revolution from the establishment of the Katipunan up to the creation of a revolutionary government under Emilio Aguinaldo in June 1898. Most of the materials account for the crucial parts of the Revolution by exploring the of ficial documents of the Katipunan, the personal correspondences of Andres Bonifacio, and the autobiography of Gregoria de Jesus. It also in cludes the Acta de la Proclamación de Independencia del Pueblo Filipino and the Decree of June 23, 1898 which both reflects the continuing struggle for in dependence and recognition by the Filipino revolutionists. 83 “Acta de la Proclamación de Independencia del Pueblo Filipino” (Declaration of Philippine Independence) written by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista Source: Gregorio F. Zaide, ed., Documentary Sources of Philippine History, vol. 9 (Metro Manila: National Bookstore, Inc., 1990), pp. 235-241. Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, born in Biñan, Laguna in 1830, was a lawyer and an adviser to General Emilio Aguinaldo. He accomplished his basic education in Laguna before transferring to Manila in or der to study law at the University of Santo Tomas. According to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), Bautista was a distant relative of Dr. Jose Rizal who of ten called him “Tio Bosyong.” Before the outbreak of the 1896 Philippine Revolution, he was a known supporter of the Propaganda Movement’s campaign for reforms. Under the context of the war, Bautista assumed the roles of political adviser and war auditor for Aguinaldo’s revolutionary government. The “Acta de la Proclamación de Independencia del Pueblo Filipino” or simply the Act of the Declaration of Philippine Independence was a document penned by Bautista in his capacity as advisor to Aguinaldo. The in dependence document was read by him before a crowd who at tended the ceremony on 12 June 1898 in Kawit, Cavite. Most in terestingly, it was Bautista and not Aguinaldo who waved the Philippine flag, according to the NHCP. The document was signed by 98 in dividuals in cluding an American colonel named L. M. Johnson who served as witness to the event. The Act of the Declaration of Philippine Independence cited in this file is an English translation most probably provided by the historian, Gregorio F. Zaide. In the town of Cavite Viejo, in this province of Cavite, on the twelfth day of June eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, before me, Don Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Auditor of War and Special Commissioner appointed to proclaim and solemnize this act by the Dictatorial Government of these Philippine Islands, for the purposes and by virtue of the circular addressed by the Eminent Dictator of the same Don Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy, the undersigned being assembled, among whom figure commanders of his army and the representatives of others who have not been able to at tend and notable residents of various to wns of the same, taking into consideration that their in habitants being already weary of bearing the ominous yoke of Spanish domination, on account of the arbitrary arrests and harsh treatment practised by the Civil Guard to the extent of causing death with the connivance and even with the expressed or ders of their commanders, who sometimes went to the extreme of or dering the shooting of prisoners under the pretext that they were at tempting to escape, in violation of the provisions of the Regulations of their Corps, which abuses were unpunished on account of the unjust deportations, especially those decreed by General Blanco, of eminent personages and of high social position, at the 84 in stigation of the Archbishop and the friars in terested in keeping them out of the way for their own and avaricious purposes, deportations which were quickly brought about by a method of precedure more execrable than that of the Inquisition and which every civilized nation rejects on account of a decision being rendered with out a hearing of the persons accused, the people determined to start an in surrectionary movement in August, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, for the purpose of recovering the in dependence and sovereignty of which Spain deprived them through the Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who continuing the course followed by his predecessor Fernando de Magallanes, who arrived upon the shores of Cebu and occupied that Island by virtue of the treaty of friendship which he celebrated with its King Tupas, although he was killed on the battle which took place on said shores, to which he was provoked by King Kalipulako de Maktan, who was suspicious of his bad in tention; he landed on the Island of Bohol, entering also into the celebrated blood compact of friendship with its King Sikatuna, for the purpose, after taking Cebu by force of arms, because the successor of Tupas did not permit him to occupy it, of coming to Manila, the capital, as he did, likewise winning the friendship of King Soliman and Lakandula and afterwards taking possession of it and thus the entire Archipelago for Spain, by virtue of an or der of King Philip II; that in view of these historical data, because in in ternational law the prescription established by the laws legalizing even the fraudulent acquisition of the property of in dividuals is not recognized, there can be no doubt as the legality of such a movement as the one that was quieted but not entirely quenched by the pacification proposed by Pedro A. Paterno with Don Emilio Aguinaldo as President of the Republican government established in Biak na bato, and accepted by the Governor General, Don Fernando Primo de Rivera, under conditions which were established, some in writing and others verbally, among them a general amnesty for all deported and sentenced; that by reason of nonfulfillment of some of these conditions after the destruction of the Spanish squadron by the North American force and the bombardment of Cavite, Don Emilio Aguinaldo returned to start a new revolution, and hardly had he given the word to commence, on the thirty-first of the last month, when several to wns anticipated movement, and on the twenty-eight between Imus and Cavite Viejo there was an engagement and captured a Spanish force one hundred and seventy- eight, commanded by a major of marine in fantry"

(Signed) AMBROSIO RIANZARES BAUTISTA 87 The declaration of Artemio Ricarte (dated 24 March 1897) concerning the Tejeros Convention Source: Jim Richardson, The Light of Liberty: Documents and Studies on the Katipunan, 1892-1897 (Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 2013), pp. 342-346. Artemio Ricarte, known by his nom de guerre “Vibora,” was one of the high-ranking generals of the Katipunan during the course of the 1896 Philippine Revolution. Ricarte was born in Batac, Ilocos Norte in 1866 where he began his for mal schooling. Eventually, he transferred to Manila for his tertiary education at Collegio de San Juan de Letran. Before the outbreak of the revolution, he was in itiated into the secret society and eventually rose through the ranks as treasurer for Balangay ng mga Anak Bayan Mapagtiis (a Katipunan chapter in San Francisco de Malabon, Cavite where he settled). When the revolution commenced, Ricarte became a commander in one of the earliest military encounters against the Spanish for ces in Cavite – the Battle of San Francisco de Malabon. During the Tejeros Convention on 22 March 1897, he was elected by his peers as the Captain-General of the revolutionary government. The declaration of Ricarte is an important document that provides a glimpse into the politics of the revolution as evidenced in the events of the Tejeros Convention. Here, Ricarte writes his reluctance to participate in an oath-taking ceremony at Tanza the day after the controversial convention. He thinks that he was obligated to at tend the ceremony due to the presence of high- ranking Magdiwang of ficials from various to wns in Cavite. In The Revolt of the Masses: The Story of Bonifacio and the Katipunan (1956), Teodoro A. Agoncillo (pp. 221-222) cites Ricarte’s revealing views about the drama in Tejeros: “This premature oath-taking will cause serious trouble and misunderstanding among the revolutionists, for I myself witnessed all that transpired in Tejeros.” The declaration of Ricarte in this file has an English translation provided the historian, Jim Richardson.

I considered myself very deficient and in adequate, and recognized that I did not have the necessary competence, and that on account of all this I could not in good conscience accept the said of fice.

Second - I knew that if this was done, it would cause much disturbance and discord in the to wns; in short, I gave them all to understand that I strongly disagreed, to the extent that I requested of the gentlemen and the to wnspeople two things: That they kill me that same night, for the reasons above cited, or that they give me three hours, or at least one hour, to think over what I must necessarily do in or der to accept said of fice; this second request was but a mere pretext, in or der to enable me to absent myself from that Assembly. I obtained nothing of what I requested, because not even one of them gave me his assent. To be brief, at the request and supplication of all, His Excellency Don Emilio Aguinaldo, President of War of S. B. Magdalo, took the oath at about eight o’clock in the evening, to gether with His Excellency Mariano Trias, Minister of Grace and Justice of S. B. Magdiwang, and though, I again repeat, I could not in good conscience accept it, I also took the oath as President of War of all Katagalugan, at about one o’clock that night.

Two in teresting matter arose from the document. The first one is one the subject of an imprisoned Augustinian friar by the name of Antonio Piernavieja who was being held captive. And the second subject is on the copy of the “Himno Nacional” which Nakpil sent to Bonifacio. The matter regarding Piernavieja, details how he was being treated in Bonifacio’s camp. Richardson noted that there seems to be an on going negotiation for Piernavieja’s released should a reasonable sum be paid. Regarding the matter of the “Himno Nacional,” Richardson noted that Nakpil composed this upon the request of Bonifacio when they were still encamped in Balara in the late months of 1896.

Malabon, February 13, 1897 The Supreme President And.: Bonifacio Maypagasa 94 “Andres Bonifacio’s Letter to Emilio Jacinto, April 16, 1897” Source: Richardson, Jim. The Light of Liberty: Documents and Studies on the Katipunan, 1892-1897. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 2013. Though the revolutionary for ces in Cavite succeeded in capturing to wns in the province during the first months of the revolution, the rivalry between the Magdalo and Magdiwang faction helped turn the tide in favor of the Spaniards. While Bonifacio hoped that his presence in the province would help remedy the animosity between the two groups such was not the case. A meeting at the estate-house in Tejeros that at tempted to create a new government to unify the effort under one banner failed. Bonifacio stormed-out of the convention after an altercation with Daniel Tirona after the latter protested Bonifacio’s election as the Director of Interior. Andres Bonifacio’s letter to Emilio Jacinto on April 16, 1897 was his first correspondence that recounts what happened during the controversial meeting at Tejeros. It contextualizes the situation in Cavite as the Spanish colonial army captures to wns which were previously under the control of the revolutionaries. The letter also details Bonifacio’s sentiment about revolutionary movement in general and the Tejeros convention in particular. In this letter, Bonifacio also expressed his dismay as there have been members of the movement who were traitors to the cause. The letter also made ment ion of Bonifacio’s plan to spread the revolution outside Manila particularly in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan.

Bonifacio Maypagasa 97 [English translation] ANDRES BONIF ACIO MAYP AGASA President of the Supreme Congress Naik, April 16, 1897 Sr. Emilio Jacinto Pingkian Most Respected Chief of the Army:- Due to the turmoil here and the entry of the enemy into the to wns of Silang, P. Dasmarinas, Bacoor, Imus, Kawit, Noveleta, Malabon, Tansa and Salinas, I have not had time to write to you in answer to your letters to me. So I shall try hard to write a letter there now, and the bearer will be our brother Don Antonino Guevara, who has most important things to tell you. I received what you sent me here: two cans of gunpowder, a sackful of empty cartridge shells, and thirty pesos. In the letter it says fifty, but that is all that reached me, because again Brother Nakpil is said to have taken the twenty pesos. The successive capture of the aforementioned to wns by the enemy is due to the unity and resolution that for merly prevailed having now been lost and spurned by the leaders. They maintain that at titude even though the situation befalling the people is dire. Here Capitan Emilio has received a letter, sent by a Jesuit called Pio Pi and a Spaniard, Rafael Comenge; this was when Imus had not yet been captured. The letter urged the leaders of the Revolution to give up this cause for which we are fighting, and said we would be given an absolute pardon. The said Capitan Emilio set out conditions he wanted to seek from the enemy, like expulsion of the friars, deputies in the Cortes, and other things, and relayed this to Don Mariano Alvarez, requesting his assent. He consulted me, and we did not assent. What the Imus people then did was that Capitan Emilio wrote in secret to the presidents of the to wns under the Magdiwang. 98 President Don Mariano learned of this, and called a meeting and sounded out everyone’ s feelings. There it was resolved to continue the fight against the Spaniards and to reject any type of reconciliation. At this meeting it was agreed to establish the Government of the revolution, but the outcome was chaos, because everybody discovered the deceit of the Magdalo people, so that meeting lost any significance. Due to the turmoil here and the defeats, the resolve of people here was broken, and Tirona, Cailles, and José del Rosario, who were Minister of War, Lieutenant-General, and Director of War, surrendered to the Spaniards, and were followed by many leaders and citizens from Tansa; these are all Magdalo people. Having witnessed this treachery on the part of Capitan Emilio’ s soldiers, nearly all (the brethren) came to me on their knees asking me to let them get away, and to take them there to our place. But I could not consent to this, because I pity the great number of in nocent citizens who would face the most dreadful troubles and slaughter. The Batangas people are under the authority of the Supreme Council, and recognize our authority. The day after to morrow they will commence at tacks on eight to wns. For this of fensive they requested my assistance, and so I sent them twenty riflemen and twenty bolomen, and the General in command is Brother Don Artemio Ricarte. The people of Batangas have already established a Provincial Government. Their general is called Don Miguel Malvar, a very in telligent man, and better, perhaps, than the generals we have so far come to know here in Tangway. If they have the for tune to take the town of Lipa, which is one of the eight to wns to be in vaded, they will in vite me to base myself there, in or der to be able, as they say, to carry the revolution into Camarines. For this reason I wish to know whether I am more needed there, in which case I shall go there; and if not, I shall direct matters here. It is essential for us to agree on how the resistance should best be continued and the revolution extended throughout the Archipelago. I the refore wish to know whether you have gone yet to Bulacan and Nueva Ecija"

Bonifacio Maypagasa. 100 Andres Bonifacio, \"Katungkulang gagawin ng mga Z. Ll. B.\" (The \"Decalogue\"), c. 1896 In 1896, various preparations were made by Andres Bonifacio and the Katipunan for a possible outbreak of the revolution. One of the Supremo’s priority was to recruit more members to the underground society. In his aim to propagate the teachings of the Katipunan, Bonifacio wrote the Decalogue or Katungkulang Gagawin ng mga Z. Ll. B. In this document, the “Father of the Philippine Revolution” outlines the duties of the Katipuneros which in clude the veneration of God, a high regard for fraternity and patriotism within the society, and a recognition for the need to claim freedom for the country. Since Bonifacio was also a Mason, his Decalogue is reminiscent of some of the essential ideals of Freemasonry like reverence to the Creator, as already ment ioned. Another Masonic aspect of the document is how it gives value to loyalty amongst brethren, even at the expense of one’s life. But what separates Freemasonry from the Katipunan is the latter’s aim to liberate the nation from the yoke of colonial oppression. In retrospect, the notion of militancy as a context for Bonifacio’s Decalogue distinguishes it from its Masonic in fluence. Bonifacio’s Decalogue is similar to Emilio Jacinto’s Kartilya which also contains the teachings of the secret society. In recognition of Jacinto’s superior writing style, Bonifacio chose to adopt Jacinto’s Kartilya as the of ficial document on the teachings of the Katipunan. Digitized copies of the Decalogue are available on line on different websites such as the Presidential Museum and Library’s digital collections and Jim Richardson’s website on the Katipunan (Kasaysayan-kkk. info).

The establishment of a Dictatorial Government followed the unfurling of the Philippine flag and the proclamation of the Philippine in dependence six days later. However, Aguinaldo’s trusted adviser Apolinario Mabini advised the president that the dictatorial government must be replaced by a revolutionary government. On 23 June 1898, Aguinaldo heeded to the advice of Mabini and he issued a decree establishing the Revolutionary Government. The establishment of the revolutionary government effectively changed the title go Aguinaldo from dictator to President of the Revolutionary Government and Commander-in-chief of its army. The decree contains three chapters. The first chapter contains the provisions on the structure and composition of the revolutionary government. The second chapter contains various provisions on the Revolutionary Congress. The third chapter contains provisions on Military Procedure. The Revolutionary Congress was tasked to draft a constitution for the Republic. On 01 August 1898, the provincial delegates ratified the declaration of Philippine in dependence to provide legitimacy to the creation of the Revolutionary Congress. A copy of June 23, 1898 Decree of Emilio Aguinaldo is available at the Presidential Museum and Library’s digital archives collection. DECREE OF JUNE 28, 1898 36 3 A.

Emilio Jacinto, known as the “Brains of the Katipunan,” wrote the “Kartilya” or the “Teachings of the Katipunan” which is considered as one of the essential documents of the secret society. Jacinto was a born in Tondo, Manila in 1875 and at tended for mal schooling at the Collegio de San Juan de Letran before studying law at the University of Santo Tomas. He unfortunately did not finish his law degree after deciding to join the Katipunan when he was 19 years old. Jacinto became one of the highest-ranking of ficers of the society who assumed the important role of being an advisor to Andres Bonifacio, among other important functions. He is also known as “Pingkian” (his nom de guerre) and “Dimasilaw” (his pseudonym).

The contents of the document explain the primary aspirations of the society and, in turn, the values that was expected from its members. Among the important teachings that the “Kartilya” elaborated were the importance of defending the oppressed, upholding good morals and character, observing equality despite being different in race and socio-economic descent, and respecting women.

Ang kabagayang pinaguusig ng katipunang ito ay lubos na dakila at mahalaga; papagisahin ang loob at kaisipan ng lahat ng tagalog (*) sa pamagitan ng isang mahigpit na panunumpa, upang 108 sa pagkakaisang ito’y magkalakas na iwasak ang masinsing tabing na nakabubulag sa kaisipan at matuklasan ang tunay na landas ng Katuiran at Kaliwanagan. (*) Sa salitang tagalog katutura’y ang lahat nang tumubo sa Sangkapuluang ito; sa makatuid, bisaya man, iloko man, kapangpangan man, etc., ay tagalog din. Dito’y isa sa mga kaunaunahang utos, ang tunay na pag-ibig sa bayang tinubuan at lubos na pagdadamayan ng isa’t isa. Maralita, mayaman, mangmang, marunong, lahat dito’y magkakapantay at tunay na magkakapatid. Kapagkarakang mapusok dito ang sino man, tataligdan pilit ang buhalhal na kaugalian, at paiilalim sa kapangyarihan ng mga banal na utos ng katipunan. Ang gawang lahat, na laban sa kamahalan at kalinisan, dito’y kinasusuklaman; kaya’t sa bagay na ito ipinaiilalim sa masigasig na pakikibalita ang kabuhayan ng sino mang nagiibig makisanib sa katipunang ito. Kung ang hangad ng papasuk dito’y ang tumalastas lamang o mga kalihiman nito, o ang ikagiginhawa ng sariling katawan, o ang kilalanin ang mga naririto’t ng maipagbili sa isang dakot na salapi, huag magpatuloy, sapagkat dito’y bantain lamang ay talastas na ng makapal na nakikiramdam sa kaniya, at karakarakang nilalapatan ng mabisang gamut, na laan sa mga sukaban. Dito’y gawa ang hinahanap at gawa ang tinitignan; kaya’t hindi dapat pumasuk ang di makagagawa, kahit magaling magsalita. Ipinauunawa din, ang mga katungkulang ginaganap ng lahat ng napaaanak sa katipunang ito ay lubhang mabibigat lalung lalu na, kung gugunitain na di magyayaring maiiwasan at walang kusang pagkukulang na di aabutin ng kakilakilabot na kaparusahan. Kung ang hangad ng papasuk dito, ang siya’y abuluyan o ang ginhawa’t malayaw na katahimikan ng katawan, huag magpatuloy, sapagkat mabigat na mga katungkulan ang matatagpuan, gaya ng pagtatangkilik sa mga naaapi at madaluhong na paguusig sa lahat ng kasamaan; sa bagay na ito ay aabuting ang maligalig na pamumuhay. 109 Di kaila sa kangino paman ang mga nagbalang kapahamakan sa mga tagalog na nakaiisip nitong mga banal na kabagayan (at hindi man), at mga pahirap na ibinibigay na nagharing kalupitan, kalikuan at kasamaan. Talastas din naman ng lahat ang pagkakailangan ng salapi, na sa ngayo’y isa sa mga unang lakas na maaasahang magbibigay buhay sa lahat; sa bagay na ito, kinakailangan ang lubos na pagtupad sa mga pagbabayaran; piso sa pagpasok at sa buan buan ay sikapat. Ang salaping ito’y ipinagbibigay alam ng nagiingat sa tuing kapanahunan, bukod pa sa mapagsisiyasat ng sinoman kailan ma’t ibigin. Di makikilos ang salaping ito, kundi pagkayarin ng karamihan. Ang lahat ng ipinagsaysay at dapat gunitain at mahinahong pagbulaybulayin, sapagkat di magaganap at di matitiis ng walang tunay na pagibig sa tinubuang lupa, at tunay na adhikang ipagtangkilik ang Kagalingan.

B ---------- Ang kabuhayang hindi ginugugol sa isang malaki at banal na kadahilanan ay kahoy na walang lilim, kundi damong makamandag. Ang gawang magaling na nagbubuhat sa pagpipita sa sarili, at hindi sa talagang nasang gumawa ng kagalingan, ay di kabaitan. Ang tunay na kabanalan ay ang pagkakawang gawa, ang pagibig sa kapua at ang isukat ang bawat kilos, gawa’t pangungusap sa talagang Katuiran. Maitim man at maputi ang kulay ng balat, lahat ng tao’y magkakapantay; mangyayaring ang isa’y higtan sa dunong, sa yaman, sa ganda…; ngunit di mahihigtan sa pagkatao. Ang may mataas na kalooban in uuna ang puri sa pagpipita sa sarili; ang may hamak na kalooban in uuna ang pagpipita sa sarili sa puri. 110 Sa taong may hiya, salita’y panunumpa. Huag mong sasayangin ang panahun; ang yamang nawala’y magyayaring magbalik; nguni’t panahong nagdaan na’y di na muli pang magdadaan. Ipagtanggol mo ang in aapi, at kabakahin ang umaapi. Ang taong matalino’y ang may pagiingat sa bawat sasabihin, at matutong ipaglihim ang dapat ipaglihim. Sa daang matinik ng kabuhayan, lalaki ay siyang patnugot ng asawa’t mga anak; kung ang umaakay ay tungo sa sama, ang patutunguhan ng iaakay ay kasamaan din. Ang babai ay huag mong tignang isang bagay na libangan lamang, kundi isang katuang at karamay sa mga kahirapan nitong kabuhayan; gamitan mo ng buong pagpipitagan ang kaniyang kahinaan, at alalahanin ang in ang pinagbuhata’t nagiwi sa iyong kasangulan. Ang di mo ibig na gawin sa asawa mo, anak at kapatid, ay huag mong gagawin sa asawa, anak, at kapatid ng iba. Ang kamahalan ng tao’y wala sa pagkahari, wala sa tangus ng ilong at puti ng mukha, wala sa pagkaparing KAHILILI NG DIOS, wala sa mataas na kalagayan sa balat ng lupa; wagas at tunay na mahal na tao, kahit laking gubat at walang nababatid kundi ang sariling wika, yaong may magandang asal, may isang pangungusap, may dangal at puri; yaong di napaaapi’t di nakikiapi; yaong marunong magdamdam at marunong lumingap sa bayang tinubuan"

In or der that all who want to enter this Association may have a full understanding and knowledge of its guiding principles and main teachings, it is necessary to make these things known to them so that they will not, to morrow or the next day, repent, and so that they may perform their duties wholeheartedly. This Association pursues a most worthy and momentous object: to unite the hearts and minds of all the Tagalogs (*) by means of an in violable oath, in or der that this union may be strong enough to tear aside the thick veil that obscures thought, and to find the true path of Reason and Enlightenment. (*The word Tagalog means all those born in this Archipelago; even a person who is a Visayan, Ilocano, or Kapampangan, etc. is the refore a Tagalog too.) One of the for emost rules here is true love of the native land and genuine compassion for one another. Poor, rich, ignorant, wise – here, all are equal and true brethren. As soon as anybody enters here, he shall perforce renounce disorderly habits and shall submit to the authority of the sacred commands of the Katipunan. All acts contrary to noble and clean living are repugnant here, and hence the life of anyone who wants to affiliate with this Association will be submitted to a searching in vestigation. If the applicant merely wishes to know the secrets of the Association, or to seek personal gratification, or to know who is here in or der to sell them for a handful of silver, he cannot proceed, for here the many who are watching him will already know his in tentions, and will immediately have recourse to an effective remedy, such as befits traitors. 112 Here, only actions are demanded and esteemed; hence anybody who is not willing to act should not enter, no matter how good a speaker he might be. It is also announced that the duties to be performed by the members of this association are exceedingly hard, especially if one remembers that there can be no dereliction or wilful evasion of duty with out the exaction of a terrible punishment. If an applicant merely desires financial support relief or wants to lead a life of bodily comfort and ease, he had better not proceed, for he will encounter weighty tasks, like the protection of the oppressed and the relentless fight against all that is evil. In this way, his fate will be a vexatious life. Nobody is unaware of the misfortune that threatens the Filipinos who contemplate these things that are sacred (and even those that are not) and the sufferings they are made to endure by the reign of cruelty, in justice and evil. Everybody also knows the need for money, which to day is one of the main things upon which we depend to bring sustenance to all. In this regard, the punctual payment of dues is required: one peso upon entry and then twelve and a half centimos each month. The custodian of the funds will periodically render an account to the members, and each member has a right to examine the accounts, should he so wish. The funds cannot be expended with out the consent of the majority. All this must be thought over and deliberated upon calmly, as it cannot be accomplished or endured by anyone who has no love for his native land and no genuine desire to promote Progress. And for the upliftment of your mind and virtue, read the following TEACHINGS OF THE KATIPUNAN OF THE SONS OF THE PEOPLE A life that is not dedicated to a great and sacred cause is like a tree with out a shade, or a poisonous weed. 113 A good deed lacks virtue if it springs from a desire for personal profit and not from a sincere desire to do good. True charity resides in acts of compassion, in love for one’ s fellow men, and in making true Reason the measure of every move, deed and word. Be their skin dark or pale, all men are equal. One can be superior to another in knowledge, wealth and beauty... but not in being. A person with a noble character values honor above self-in terest, while a person with an ignoble character values self-in terest above honor. An honorable man’ s word is his bond. Don’t waste time; lost wealth may be recovered, but time lost is lost for ever. Defend the oppressed and fight the oppressor. An in telligent man is he who takes care in everything he says and keeps quiet about what must be kept secret. Along the thorny path of life, the man leads the way and his wife and children follow. If the leader goes the way of perdition, then so do those who are led. Do not regard a woman as a mere plaything, but as a helpmate and partner in the hardships of this existence. Have due regard to her weakness, and remember the mother who brought you into this world and nurtured you in your in fancy. What you would not want done to your wife, daughter and sister, do not do to the wife, daughter and sister of another. A man’ s worth does not come from him being a king, or in the height of his nose and the whiteness of his face, or in him being a priest, a REPRESENTATIVE OF GOD, or in his exalted position on the face of this earth"

When these doctrines have spread and the brilliant sun of beloved liberty shines on these poor Islands, and sheds its sweet light upon a united race, a people in everlasting happiness, then the lives lost, the struggle and the suffering will have been more than recompensed. 115 Andres Bonifacio. “Pag-ibig sa tinubuang bayan.” (c 1896) Sina Andres Bonifacio at Emilio Jacinto ang mga pangunahing tagapaghayag ng simulain at adhikain ng Katipunan. Nababasa sa mga akda nina Bonifacio at Jacinto ang kamalayang pambansa na hinihimok ang mga Pilipino na magkaisa at lumaban para sa kasarinlan at kalayaan. Ilan sa mga kilalang akda ni Bonifacio ang “Hibik ng Filipinas sa Ynang España,” “Ang dapat mabatid ng mga tagalog,” “Katungkulang gagawin ng mga Z. Ll. B,” at “Pag-ibig sa tinubuang bayan.” Ang Pag-ibig sa tinubuang bayan” ay nailathala sa Kalayaan ang pahayagan ng lihim na samahang Katipunan. Nailathala noong Marso 1896 ang una at nag-iisang edisyon ng Kalayaan. Sa kasamaang palad, wala pang kopya ng mga pahina ng pahayagan ang natagpuan hanggang sa kasalukuyan. Ang nilalaman ng pahayagan ay mahihinuha mula sa iba’t ibang hiwalay na batis tulad ng mga borador ng artikulo bago ito malimbag. Ang tulang “Pag-ibig sa tinubuang bayan” ay muling nilathala ni Jose P. Santos, Pilipinong historyador at anak ng isa ring kilalang historyador na si Epifanio de los Santos, noong 1935. Maaaring hinango ito mula sa isang sulat-kamay na borador ng tula at hindi mula sa pahina ng Kalayaan. Kamakailan, isa pang bersyon ng borador ng tula ang natagpuan sa Archivo General Militar de Madrid. Sa isang pag-aaral ni Jim Richardson, pinagkumpara ang dalawang teksto nito upang unawain ang pagkakaiba nito at kilalanin ang tunay na nagsulat nito. Mula sa analisis ng nilalaman, mga salita at or to grapiya ang dalawang bersyon (bersyong Santos at bersyong Madrid), kakaunti lamang ang pagkakaiba sa dalawang borador. Nagpapatunay ito na si Andres Bonifacio nga ang nagsulat ng nabanggit na tula (Richardson 2013, 193-194). Matutunghayan sa kabuuang 28 saknong na tula ang adhikain at kaisipan na isinusulong ng Katipunan para sa malaya at nagsasariling bansa.

Isa sa mga akda ni Andres Bonifacio, “Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog” ay nailathala sa pinakauna at nag-iisang isyu ng pahayagang Kalayaan, ang opisyal na pahayagan ng Katipunan, noong Marso 1896. Ginamit ni Andres Bonifacio ang sagisag-pangalan na Agapito Bagumbayan nang in ilathala ang akdang ito sa Kalayaan. Hanggang sa kasalukuyan, hindi pa nakikita at natutuklasan ang kumpletong kopya ng lahat ng pahina ng Kalayaan. Nailimbag sa mga hiwalay na akda ang nilalaman ng pahayagan sa mga natuklasang borador at salin ng mga ito. Sa kaso ng “Ang Dapat Mabatid” muling nailathala ito sa wikang Espanyol sa isinagawang salin ni Juan Caro y Mora para sa Archivo del bibliófilo filipino ni Wenceslao Retana noong 1897. Isa ring salin nito sa Espanyol ang isinagawa ni Epifanio de los Santos para sa Revista Filipina noong 1917. Samantala noong 1935, in ilimbag ni Jose P. Santos ang teksto nito sa or ihinal na wikang Tagalog bilang bahagi ng kanyang akdang Andres Bonifacio at ang Himagsikan. Ipinapalagay na ginamit ni Jose P. Santos ang isang sulat-kamay na borador ng sanaysay na nasa pangangalaga ng kanyang ama na si Epifanio de los Santos. Kilala si Epifanio de los Santos bilang pangunahing tagapangalaga at kolektor ng maraming manuskrito ng Katipunan. Bagaman may mga pagkakaiba ang mga bersyong nabanggit, naniniwala ang maraming iskolar na ang tekstong Tagalog ni Jose P. Santos na “Ang Dapat Mabatid” ay tunay at hindi huwad na nilikha lamang upang palabasin na akda ito ni Bonifacio. Kung babasahin “Ang Dapat Mabatid” ito ay may habang higit sa 700-salita at matutunghayan sa sanaysay na ito ang panawagan ni Bonifacio na pukawin ang damdamin at isip ng mga kababayang Pilipino upang lumahok sa Katipunan at humiwalay sa Espanya. Nababasa sa sanaysay na ito ang mga natatanging kaisipan na isinusulong ng Katipunan para sa lahat ng mga Pilipino. Sa simula ng sanaysay, ipinamalas ni Bonifacio ang malalim na pag-uugat sa kasaysayan ng kilusang Katipunan nang ilahad niya ang kaibahan ng kalagayan ng kapuluan bago dumating ang mga Espanyol at sa panahon ng pananatili ng mga banyaga sa Pilipinas sa loob ng tatlong daang taon. Mababasa sa sipi ang malinaw na paglalahad ni Bonifacio: Ytong Katagalugan na pinamamahalaan ng unang panahon ng at ing tunay na mga kababayan... lubos na kasaganaan, at kaguinhawahan.

Nababasa sa sanaysay na ito ang mga natatanging kaisipan na isinusulong ng Katipunan para sa lahat ng mga Pilipino. Sa simula ng sanaysay, ipinamalas ni Bonifacio ang malalim na pag-uugat sa kasaysayan ng kilusang Katipunan nang ilahad niya ang kaibahan ng kalagayan ng kapuluan bago dumating ang mga Espanyol at sa panahon ng pananatili ng mga banyaga sa Pilipinas sa loob ng tatlong daang taon. Mababasa sa sipi ang malinaw na paglalahad ni Bonifacio: Ytong Katagalugan na pinamamahalaan ng unang panahon ng at ing tunay na mga kababayan... lubos na kasaganaan, at kaguinhawahan.

Mahalagang pansinin ang paggamit din ng mga salitang “kasaganaan” at “kaguinhawahan” upang ilarawan ang kalagayan ng mga Pilipino bago dumating ang mga Espanyol. Sinundan ni Bonifacio ang kanyang paglalahad ng maliwanag na nakaraan ng isang madilim na paglalarawan sa panahon ng pananakop. Ang panahon ng pananatili ng mga Espanyol ay nagdulot ng paglaho ng “kaguinhawahan” (kaginhawahan). Ayon kay Bonifacio, taliwas ito sa pangako ni Legaspi kay Sikatuna sa kasunduang pinagtibay ng sandugo. Basahin ang sumusunod na salita ni Bonifacio: Ngayon wala ng maituturing na kapanatagan sa at ing pamayanan, ngayon lagui na guinagambala ang at ing katahimikan ng umaalingawngaw na daing at pananbitan bunton hininga at hinagpis... Tahasang isiniwalat ni Bonifacio ang katotohanan sa pinagmulan ng kahirapan ng mga Pilipino. Inilarawan sa sanaysay ang paglupig ng mga Espanyol, ang paghihirap at paghihinagpis na dulot ng “tanikala” ng mga banyagang umalipin at sumakop sa mga Pilipino. Dahil dito hinimok ni Bonifacio na buksan ng mga Pilipino ang kanilang ng mga mata at isipan. Ayon kay Bonifacio ang “kaguinhawahan” ay “hindi darating at hindi mangyayari” mula sa mga Espanyol. Aniya: Ytinuturo ng katuiran, na huag nating sayangin ang panahon sa pagasa sa ipinangakong kaguinhawahan na hindi darating at hindi mangyayari. Ytinuturo ng katuiran ang tayo’y umasa sa at ing sarili at huag antain sa iba ang at ing kabuhayan Ang salitang katuiran (katwiran, mula sa salitang-ugat tuwid) ay isa pang mahalagang konseptong ginamit din ni Bonifacio sa “Ang Dapat Mabatid.” Matapos isiwalat ang kasalukuyang kalagayan ng Pilipinas, isa namang panawagan ang kanyang ibinigay sa lahat magkaisa sa pagsulong ng adhikain ng Katipunan. Sa pagtatapos ng sanaysay, matapang ang panawagan ni Bonifacio sa mga Pilipino sa pamamagitan ng sumusunod na salita: “Kaya! oh mga kababayan! at ing idilat ang bulag na kaisipan at kusang igugol sa kagalingan ang at ing lakas sa tunay at lubos na pag asa na mag tagumpay sa nilalayong kaguinhawahan ng bayang tinubuan.” 119 Jesus, Gregoria de. Mga tala ng aking buhay at mga ulat ng Katipunan. May paunang salita ni Jose P. Santos. Maynila: Limbagang Fajardo, 1932. Katangi-tanging primaryang batis ukol sa Himagsikang Pilipino ang Mga tala ng aking buhay at mga ulat ng Katipunan ni Gregoria de Jesus. Si Gregoria de Jesus, balo ni Andres Bonifacio, ay tinaguriang Lakambini ng Katipunan at naging tagapagtatag at pangalawang tagapangulo ng sangay ng kababaihan ng Katipunan. Sinulat noong 5 Nobyembre 1928 sa kahilingan ni Jose P. Santos, ang akdang “Mga tala ng aking buhay” ay nalimbag sa wikang Ingles noong 1930 sa publikasyong Philippine Magazine, sa salin ni Leandro H. Fernandez, isang Pilipinong historyador, at sa isa pang salin sa Ingles ni Jose P. Bantug sa The Philippine Herald. Inilathala rin ang salin nito sa wikang Espanyol sa The Philippine Free Press at sa La Opinion. Bilang asawa ni Andres Bonifacio at aktibong kasapi sa Katipunan kasama ang mga kapatid na babae, magulang at asawa ng iba pang Katipunero, ang Mga tala ng aking buhay ay paglalahad ng pananaw ng kababaihan sa Katipunan at Himagsikang 1896. Matutunghayan sa sariling talambuhay ni Gregoria de Jesus ang ilang yugto sa kanyang buhay tulad ng kanyang kapanganakan noong 9 Mayo 1875 sa Caloocan, mga magulang, pag-aaral, kabataan at pag- usbong pag-iibigan sa edad na labingwalong taong gulang kay Andres Bonifacio. Inilahad din ni Oryang, palayaw ni Gregoria de Jesus, sa “Mga tala ng aking buhay” ang pagpapakasal niya kay Andres sa simbahan at sa isa pang hiwalay na seremonya alinsunod sa Katipunan sa tahanan ni Restituto Javier na sinaksihan ng mga kasapi ng Katipunan. Bilang Lakambini ng Katipunan, nakisangkot at lumahok sa mga gawain ng Katipunan si Oryang. Matutunghayan sa maikling talambuhay na ito ang mga panganib na sinuong niya sa pag-iingat sa mga dokumento at gamit ng Katipunan at kinailangang magpalipat-lipat ng tirahan upang magtago at umiwas sa pagsubaybay ng awtoridad. Sa mga panahong yaon, isinilang ni Oryang ang sanggol na lalaki ngunit binawian din ng buhay makalipas ng ilang buwan. Mababanggit din ni Oryang ang kanyang mga karanasan sa panahon ng himagsikan mula sa unang sigaw ng himagsikan hanggang sa kanyang pangalawang pagpapakasal kay Julio Nakpil noong 1898. Nabanggit sa bahaging ito ang ilang personalidad sa himagsikan tulad nina Emilio Aguinaldo, Emilio Jacinto, Macario Sakay at Esperidiona Bonifacio, kapatid ni Andres. Matutunghayan din ang salaysay ng paghihirap ng mga Pilipino sa lumalaban para sa kalayaan at kasarilan. Tulad ng ibang kasapi ng himagsikan, kinailangan din ni Oryang na pag-aaralang gumamit ng mga sandata para lumahok sa mga labanan. Ilang pangungusap lamang ang in ilahad sa “Mga tala sa aking buhay” ukol sa mga naganap sa Cavite: tulad ng “magulong halalan” sa Tejeros dahil sa “katampalasang ginawa ng mga kabig na pinumumunan ni Aguinaldo” (pah 17) hanggang sa pagpatay kay Andres Bonifacio. May hiwalay na salaysay ukol dito si Oryang na sinulat niya sa isang liham para kay Emilio Jacinto (Richardson).

Aguinaldo and the American Forces in the country. The war was regarded as a continuation of the on going 1896 Philippine Revolution, while the United States simply regarded the conflict as an in surrection. The war led to the deaths of Filipino combatants and the fall of the first Philippine Republic. The war of ficially ended in July 1902. This section contains primary and secondary sources that will help the students enrich their understanding and learning of the significant events that transpired during the Filipino-American War. Primary sources such as the account of Private Willian Grayson, Aguinaldo’s Declaration of War, and the Address Adopted by Anti-Imperialist League provide a glimpse into the early parts of the war. On the other hand, secondary sources on the Filipino-American War in this section provides a historiographical understanding of the event. 128 Account of Private William Grayson 19 The Treaty of Paris of 1898 ended the Spanish-American War and decided on the fate of Spain’s remaining colonies in cluding the Philippines. For this, it was also of great importance to the Filipinos who had been fighting for their in dependence since 1896. Unfortunately, its contents were finalized with out consulting with Aguinaldo’s government, the reby amplifying suspicions regarding the true motives of the Americans in the Philippines. This eventually led to the outbreak of the Philippine-American War on February 4, 1899 – an event previously called the “San Juan Bridge Incident.” Further in vestigations later revealed that the first shot of the war occurred in Silencio cor. Sociego Streets in Santa Mesa, Manila. 20 One of the primary sources regarding this event was from Private William Walter Grayson, an American volunteer soldier of the First Nebraska V olunteer Infantry. From his own recollection of the encounter, it becomes clear that it was Grayson himself who fired the first shot which killed two Filipino soldiers. According to Teodoro Agoncillo, General Arthur Mac Arthur issued his or der to advance against the Filipinos the day after this in cident with out even properly in vestigating the cause of the firing, the reby beginning the Philippine-American War. 21 ---------- Private William Grayson, in an in terview, said of this important in cident: “About eight o'clock, (Private Orville) Miller and I were cautiously pacing our district. We came to a fence and were trying to see what the Filipinos were up to. Suddenly, near at hand, on our left, there was a low but unmistakable Filipino outpost signal whistle. It was immediately answered by a similar whistle about twenty-five yards to the right. Then a red lantern flashed its signal from blockhouse No. 7. We had never seen such a sign used before. In a moment something rose slowly up not twenty-five feet in front of us. It was a Filipino. I yelled ‘halt’ made it pretty loud, for I was accustomed to challenging the of ficer of the guard in Edwin Wildman, Aguinaldo: A Narrative of Filipino Ambitions (Boston, Massachusetts: Lothrop 19 Publishing Company, 1901), p. 195-196, accessed 25 October 2020, http:// name. umdl. umich. edu/ahz 9331.0001.001.

And while this plan to take over the Philippines received significant support from many Americans, a number of prominent citizens of the country, many of whom were politicians and in tellectuals, still fearlessly expressed their opposition to the measure. In June 1898, these dissenters, which in cluded for mer president Grover Cleveland, for mer senator George S. Boutwell, Stanford University’s founding president David Starr Jordan, writer Mark Twain, and steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, for med the Anti-Imperialist League. As a response to Filipino-American hostilities, this Boston-based league released a statement on February 10, 1898 which criticized the expansionist ideals of the US government as largely in consistent with the founding principles of their country. It also warned that any further move to be committed by the Americans pertinent to the Philippines might endanger the security not only of the US but as well as of the entire world. The statement likewise beseeched the US government to acknowledge Aguinaldo as the rightful president of the Philippines and its congress as a legitimate representation of the people similar to the Continental Congress of the 13 British Colonies which later became the United States. In the end, the members of the league demanded the US government to with draw its military for ces from the Philippines and to in stead recognize its in dependence. ---------- 10 February 1899 The full ratification of the Treaty with Spain will cause a technical change in the relations of the United States to the Philippine Islands, but will afford no- reason for any change of the purposes of the Anti-Imperialists in regard to the future of the islands, nor will it in the least affect the clear duty of this Republic. We are now engaged in warfare with the in habitants of those islands. It is unprofitable to discuss the question as to which party began hostilities. No other result could have been expected, when the lines of two opposing military for ces were held so close and in such tense condition that little was needed to cause an explosion. Anti-Imperialist League, Address Adopted by the Anti-Imperialist League, February 10, 1899 22 (Boston, Massachusetts: Anti-Imperialist League, 1899), accessed 25 October 2020, https:// archive. org/details/addressadoptedby 00 anti. 131 Certain facts, however, are beyond dispute: that Aguinaldo was brought to the islands by our own warship, that his aid was accepted and desired in our military operations against the Spaniards, and that hopes of in dependence were encouraged by our consuls and other of ficers. It is equally in disputable that a parliament of the islands, or ganized by representatives elected by 186 to wns and provinces, chose Aguinaldo President and framed a constitution, which was promulgated, defining the powers and duties of the separate departments of the government with remarkable clearness and ability; that the government so for med beyond a doubt represented fairly the people of the islands and probably with quite as much fairness as the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, in 1775, represented the people of the thirteen States. It is also undeniable that on January 5 President Mc Kinley issued a proclamation through General Otis, declaring that on the 10 th of the previous month the Philippine Islands had been ceded to this country by Spain by the signature of the Treaty of Paris, and further or dered him to extend the military government of the United States ‘to the whole of the ceded territory,’ and to demand the surrender of Iloilo, which was then held by the Filipinos in an or derly manner by capture from the Spaniards. It cannot be claimed in law that this assumption of power was warranted in advance of the ratification of the Treaty by both parties, and there can he no doubt that the arbitrary claim greatly aggravated the people of the islands, whose hope of in dependence seemed thus rudely destroyed. No declaratory resolution as to the future of the islands was assented to by the Administration before the ratification of the Treaty by the Senate, and none has been made since. Any right that we assert to ownership of the Philippines must rest, the refore, either upon conquest or upon purchase from their Spanish oppressors, or upon both, and in any case it is, as we believe, in consistent with the principles of this Republic, and fraught with danger to its peace and to the peace of the world. The first result we already witness, a war of subjugation, which must embitter the people we seek to rule, and which, however successful, must bring disaster and death to our soldiers, and unmeasured cost to our people. Profoundly impressed with the seriousness of the situation, it is the purpose of the Anti- Imperialists to continue the circulation of literature, to assist in the for mation of leagues, and by public meetings, and every proper means known to a free people, to agitate for the revival in the 132 land of the spirit of Washington and Lincoln, to protest against a spirit of militarism and force, to oppose the colonial idea and a permanently large standing army, and to assert the vital truths of the Declaration of Independence embodied in the Constitution and in dissolubly connected with the welfare of this Republic.

President Emilio Aguinaldo received a communication from the Caloocan station regarding the event. He issued a declaration to the Filipino people saying that he had taken necessary actions to preserved the friendly ties between the Filipinos and the American for ces, however, he said that the national in tegrity must be preserved as well. In this declaration, he also recognized that the American for ces who were acting as friends and liberators unjustly at tacked the Filipino for ces. Aguinaldo issued three commands in his declaration: first, he or dered that all peace and friendly relations between the Filipino and American for ces be severed and the latter be treated as enemies; second, the captured Americans will be treated as prisoners of wars; and lastly, the declaration must be copy furnished to all the consuls in Manila and the Congress. A copy of Aguinaldo’s declaration is available in John Taylor’s Philippine Insurgent Records. Taylor was a member of the United States Army in the Philippines. He was given appointed to be in charge of all the records seized by the American for ces during the Philippine-American War. A compilation of these records came to known later on as the Philippine Insurgent Records. Excerpt: Nine o'clock p. m., this date, I received from Caloocan station a message communicated to me that the American for ces, with out prior notification or any just motive, at tacked our camp at San Juan del Monte and our for ces garrisoning the block-houses around the outskirts of Manila, causing the losses among our soldiers, who in view of this unexpected aggression and of the decided at tack of the aggressors, were obliged to defend the mselves until the firing became general all along the line. No one can deplore more than I this rupture of friendly relations. I have a clear conscience that I have endeavored to avoid it at all costs, using all my efforts to preserve friendship with the army of occupation, even at the cost of not a few humiliations and many sacrificed rights. But it is my unavoidable duty to maintain the in tegrity of the national honor and that of the army so unjustly at tacked by those who, posing as our friends and liberators, at tempted to dominate us in place of the Spaniards, as is shown by the grievances enumerated in my manifesto of January 8 th last; such as the continued outrages and violent exactions committed against the people of Manila, the useless conferences, and all my frustrated efforts in favor of peace and concord. Summoned by this unexpected provocation, urged by the duties imposed upon me by honor and patriotism and for the defense of the nation entrusted to me, calling on God as a witness of my good faith and the uprightness of my in tentions, I or der and command: 134 1. Peace and friendly relations between the Philippine for ces and the American for ces of occupation are broken, and the latter will be treated as enemies, within the limits prescribed by the laws of war. 2. American soldiers who may be captured by the Philippine for ces will be treated as prisoners of war. 3. This proclamation shall be communicated to the accredited consuls of Manila, and to Congress, in or der that it may accord the suspension of the constitutional guaranties and the resulting declaration of war. Given at Malolos, February 4, 1899. EMILIO AGUINALDO General-in-Chief 135 Emilio Aguinaldo’s Proclamation of Surrender to the United States, April 19, 1901 23 With the arrival of American reinforcements in March 1899, the United States’ campaign against the Filipinos quickly gained momentum in many parts of the Philippines.

On November 12, Tarlac, the last revolutionary capital, was captured by the Americans which signaled the collapse of or ganized Filipino resistance. And with the fall of his top of ficials such as Mabini, Luna, and 24 del Pilar, Aguinaldo was for ced to flee to the mountains to avoid capture. Eventually, with the surrender of his personal messenger Cecilio Seguismundo and with the help of the Macabebes of Pampanga, Aguinaldo was arrested by Colonel Frederick Funston in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901. Aguinaldo was brought to Manila where he released a proclamation stating his of ficial surrender to the United States on April 19.

Golay, Face of the Empire: United States-Philippine Relations, 1898-1946 (Quezon 24 City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1997), p. 53. 136 TO THE FILIPINO PEOPLE: I believe I am not in error in presuming that the unhappy fate to which my adverse for tune has led me is not a surprise to those who have been familiar with the progress of the war. The lessons taught with a full meaning and which have recently come to my knowledge suggest with irresistible force that a complete termination of hostilities and lasting peace are not only desirable, but absolutely essential to the welfare of the Philippine Islands. The Filipinos have never been dismayed at their weakness, nor have they faltered in following the path pointed out by their for titude and courage. The time has come, however, in which they find their advance along this path to be impeded by an irresistible force, which, while it restrains them, yet enlightens their minds and opens to them another course, presenting them the cause of peace. This cause has been joyfully embraced by the majority of my fellow-countrymen, who have already united around the glorious sovereign banner of the United States. In this banner they repose their trust, and believe that under its protection the Filipino people will at tain all those promised liberties which they are beginning to enjoy. The country has declared unmistakably in favor of peace. So be it. There has been enough blood, enough tears, and enough desolation. This wish cannot be ignored by the men still in arms if they are animated by a desire to serve our noble people, which has thus clearly manifested its will. So do I respect this will, now that it is known to me. After mature deliberation, I resolutely proclaim to the world that I cannot refuse to heed the voice of a people longing for peace, nor the lamentations of thousands of families yearning to see their dear ones enjoying the liberty and the promised generosity of the great American Nation. By acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States throughout the Philippine Archipelago, as I now do, and with out any reservation whatsoever, I believe that I am serving thee, my beloved country. May happiness be thine! EMILIO AGUINALDO 137 Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation by US Willam Mc Kinley, December 21, 1898. Retrieved from Blount, James. American Occupation of the Philippines, 1898-1912. (New York & London: G. P. Putnamn’s Sons, 1913) The Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation issued by President William Mc Kinley on December 21, 1898, is among the primary sources collated by James Blount, an American volunteer and district judge, during his sojourn in the Philippine archipelago in the early years of American occupation in the Philippine Archipelago by the turn of the 20 th century. The compilation of the historical documents entitled American Occupation of the Philippines, 1898-1912 is considered to be the culmination of Blount’s anti-imperialist advocacy. Aside from of fering a first-hand account of the Philippine American War and the early years of US colonization in the Philippines, the book at tempts to of fer a balance account of the period from the perspective of prominent figures in the Philippine-American War (such as George Dewey, Wesley Merritt, Elwell Otis and Emilio Aguinaldo, to name a few), alongside Blount’s own in terpretation to the turn of events that had taken place. As to the chief implementer of the Benevolent Assimilation, William Mc Kinley was the 25 th President of the United States of America who ran under the banner of the Republican Party whose main policy then in volved the expansion of the power and in fluence of United States across the globe. The proclamation constitutes the of ficial for eign policy of the Executive Arm of the US government in accordance to their aim in espousing their “Manifest Destiny” ideology and assuming the “white man’s burden” role as their ways and means to justify their imperialist motives. Blount provided the historical background that led to the issuance of the proclamation and of fered a scathing take which labels the proclamation as the “Pandora box of Philippine woes”.

THE BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION PROCLAMAION EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 21, 1898. The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila by the United States naval squadron commanded by the United States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Dewey, followed by the reduction of the city and the surrender of the Spanish for ces, practically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the suspension of Spanish sovereignty the rein. With the signature of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at Paris on the 10 th in stant, and as a result of the victories of American arms, the future control, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands are ceded to the United States. In the fulfillment of the rights of sovereignty thus acquired and the responsible obligations of government thus assumed, the actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the Philippine Islands becomes immediately necessary, and he military government heretofore maintained by the United States in the city, harbor, and bay of Manila is to be extended with all possible dispatch to the whole of the ceded territory. In performing this duty to the military commander of the United States is enjoined to make known to the in habitants of the 138 Philippine Islands that in succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain, in severing the for mer political relations, and in establishing a new political power, the authority of the United States is to be exerted for the securing of the persons and property of the people of the islands and for the confirmation of all their private rights and relations. It will be the duty of the commander of the for ces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come not as in vaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission, co-operate with the Government of the United States to give effect to these beneficent purposes will receive the reward of its support and protection. All others will be brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness if need be, but with out severity, so far as possible. Within the absolute domain of military authority, which necessarily is and must remain supreme in the ceded territory until the legislation of the United States shall otherwise provide, the municipal laws of the territory in respect to private rights and property and the repression of crime are to be considered as continuing in force, and to be administered by the or dinary tribunals, so far as practicable. The operations of civil and municipal government are to be performed by of ficers as may accept the supremacy of the United States by taking the oath of allegiance, or by of ficers chosen, as far as practicable, from the in habitants of the islands. While the control of all the public property and the revenues of the state passes with the cession, and while he use and management of all public means of transportation are necessarily reserved to the authority of the United States, private property, whether belonging to the in dividuals or corporations, is to be respected except for cause duly established. The taxes and duties heretofore payable by the in habitants to the late government become payable to the authorities of the United States unless it be seen fit to substitute for them other reasonable rates or modes of contribution to the expenses of government, whether general or local. If private property be taken for military use, it shall be paid for when possible in cash, at a fair valuation, and when payment in cash is not practicable, receipts are to be given. All ports and places in the Philippine islands in the actual possession of the land and naval for ces of the United States will be opened to the commerce of all friendly nations. All goods and wares no prohibited for military reasons by due announcement of the military authority will be admitted upon payment of such duties and other charges as shall be in force at the time of their importation. Finally, it should be the earnest wish and paramount aim of the military administration to win the confidence, respect, and affection of the in habitants of the Philippines by assuring them in every possible way that full measure of in dividual rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of Benevolent Assimilation substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule. In the fulfillment of this high mission, supporting the temperate administration of affairs for the greatest good of the governed, there must be sedulously maintained the strong arm of authority, to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles to the bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government upon the people of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of the United States.

Natanggap ko ang unang sulat mula sa mga komisyonadong sinalubong ko sa Kobe tulad ng nabalitaan ninyo sa pamamagitan ng aking postcard. Natanggap ko kasama ng huling sulat ang letra de cambio na may numero 176 na maipapalit sa Yokohama Specie Bank Ltd. Sa halagang 65.48 yen, bilang pagbabalik sa mga ginastos ko sa papel. Salamat dito. ayon sa in yong bilin, ilalagay ko bilang gastos ng representasyon dito ang mga kinuha ni Sr. G. Agoncillo. Padadalhan ko kayo ng listahan ng mga gastos dito sa susunod na liham. Wala akong panahon sa ngayon. Tumuloy na sa San Francisco sina Sr. Luna, Sr. Lozada, at Sr. Marti noong ika-27 ng nakaraang buwan. Sinunod nila Heneral Riego at Sr. M. Rivera ang payo ng mga Hapones at naiwan sila rito. Nakatira sila sa bahay ninyo at ni Sr. Rivero. Bago umalis ang tatlong nabanggit, nakausap naming noong ika-23 ang isang taong may napakataas na posisyon sa kasalukuyang pamahalaan. Sinabi sa amin ng ginoong ito na hindi tatanggapin ng Hapon na masakop tayo ng ibang bansang makapangyarihan. Sinabi niyang natutuwa ang Hapon na gumaganda ang takbo ng at ing Gobyerno at in aasam nito ang pagtatatag ng at ing Republika. Hindi na siya makapagdagdag dito dahil isa siyang opisyal ng pamahalaan. Ngunit dahil itinataguyod niya ang kapayapaan, pinagpayuhan niya ang mga komisyonado na ituloy ang kanilang biyahe para sa propaganda sa Amerika at Europa, lalung-lalo na sa Inglatera at Alemanya. Walang dudang pakikinggan ng Amerika ang payo ng dalawang bansang ito. Tulad ng sinabi ko na sa inyo, higit na matutulugan tayo ng mga militar ngunit hindi tayo dapat magtaka na nagmula sa isang diplomatiko ang mga pangungusap na iyon. Hinggil naman sa kasalukuyang ginagawang negosasyon para sa mga armas, nagkaroon ng panibagong pagkaantala, ngayong pang hawak na namin ang 50 mil yen na ipinadala ninyo. Imposible kaming makakilos dahil walang tao rito mula noong Pasko. Bukod dito, palaging nagmamatyag ang mga Amerikano sa pagdating ng mga komisyonado. Ito ang pumipigil sa mga Hapon na bumuo ng isang mapanganib na desisyon. Sinasabing dapat nilang makuhang pagkatiwalaan muli ng mga Amerikano tulad ng dati bago sila kumilos. Lubos naming ikinalulungkot ito. upang madaliin ang takbo ng mga pangyayari, ipinaiwan namin dito si Heneral Riego. Hinihintay naming ngayon ang ika-8 sa pagbalik ng mga nagsipagbakasyon at muli naming lalakarin ang bagay na ito. kapag natapos na ang mga nakabimbing negosasyon at narito na ang hahalili sa akin, uuwi na ako dahil ito rin ang kagustuhan ng at ing Presidente. Naghahanap kami ng mga sundalong retirado o nasa hukbong reserbado na gustong sumama. Dapat maganda ang kanilang ugali, marunong ng Ingles o Pranses, at hindi mahirap pakisamahan. Hindi ito pagsasantabi ng mga opisyal na maaring ibigay sa at ing pamahalaan. Sinabi sa akin ng Direktor ng Giyera sa isang liham na may 50 ang kailagan doon. Mahihirapan ang pamahalaan na bigyan tayo ng ganoon karaming mga opisyal. Binabati ko kayo ng Manigong Bagong Taon at muli nagsasabing isa ninyong magili na kaibigan at kasama si M.

X account as a historical document draws from its “spontaneity” and “unofficial nature” as what Jousselin noted “ [the entries] reveal the man behind the military of ficer, watching the battle in progress, and freely expressing his reactions and opinions.” However, one should also take a grain of salt when reading and using Lt. X entries as there are evidences of lower treatment to wards the natives can be gleaned (ie: use of the term “in surgent” in stead of “revolution” in labelling the Filipino faction in the war). SIEGE OF MANILA Sunday, 29 May The blockade of Manila is now a month old. The weather will worsen. The Americans have not planted their strategy against the city. They are waiting for the ground troops to arrive from San Francisco. Meanwhile, the in surgents have taken up arms, each day coming closer to Manila, where the Spaniards have allowed the mselves to be hemmed in. There will be enough time for action when the Americans disembark. In the bay, we see the English who seem to be well positioned beside Admiral Dewey’s squadron, the Germans giving the impression that they have a strategy, the Japanese who come and go, and the French who wait, observing, fully aware that their presence will not in fluence the coming events. Each fleet is preoccupied with protecting its nationals. On Thursday morning the French delegates came on board, led by the consul anda French engineer who works at the Compagnie Generale des Tabacs. We discussed the arrangements: the engineer can provide us with a company ship for transporting the maximum number of men, along with their valuable possessions and provisions, when the at tack is confirmed. We think that this will happen anytime now. The ship will the refore come alongside and be protected by our cannons. There is room for a large number of persons. France is protecting the Greeks, the Rumanians, the Valaques, and all her for mer Levantine clientele – with out continuing the Turks. Many women of easy virtue are 142 from the Levant. They pretend to be Moldo- Valaques, but whether they are or not, they also need our protection. The fear of bombing poses a great number of social problems. Essentially, the in surgents are at the moment the masters of the situation. It is their word which prevails on land. They are feared by the Spaniards and have given their support to the Americans. Can the Spaniards’ travail be taken seriously? Everything they do could be merely to give the impression that they alone have prepared defensive measures. Monday, May 30 This morning, at 6 0’clock, I went on shore with a comrade. We visited the markets of Binondo and San Miguel. There is an enormous crowd of Tagals and Chinese. Baskets full of fish and delicious fruits are everywhere. The smell of the Chinese overpowers even that of the sea. There is an abundance of lively colors and movements. The looks directed at us are either sympathetic or in different, but not at all hostile. The streets are swarming with people discussing among the mselves, keeping pace with the tempo on the streets with out stopping for a single moment to reflect on the present catastrophe before them. -And yet, someone said to us an hour later, the fighting began this morning, very early, at Las Piñas, at the very threshold of Manila. The in surgents are putting less and less distance between the mselves and the Spaniards with each passing moment. Before long, the two will be at each other’s throats. -What exactly do the in surgents want? -The other day there was an important meeting between the Philippine chiefs and the high of ficials in Manila, in which Aguinaldo was supposed to have been the spokesman for his side. He simply stated that his men were well armed, a fact the Spaniards are quite aware of since they the mselves had armed the Tagals a month ago. They seemed pleased with the mselves that the in surgents of a year ago are now on their side against the Americans. in spite of everything, Aguinaldo is alleged to have of fered his assistance, provided that three conditions be followed: 1) the expulsion of all religious or ders; 2) the transfer of all ecclesiastical goods, furniture, and buildings for the civil use of the Filipinos; 3) absolute autonomy. This is what is being rumored around, but there is no truth to it. Aguinaldo is in Cavite, brought there from Hongkong by the Americans. In the city, the for eigners are getting worried. This is an absurd situation which cannot go on any longer. Tomorrow the ships which have been chartered will leave the river. The trunks are fast and secure and the final pieces of baggage are being put on board. -And what is the news from Europe? -The opinions one hears in the city are that the European powers will provide help. We are confident of Germany. I have received a report from a Hongkong correspondent that a naval battle can be expected. Details of the expected American defeat are not yet known, and Europe is preparing to in tervene at the earliest opportunity. 143 Letter of Henry Thompson to his parents dated 8 February 1899, published in Inside the Fighting First: Papers of a Nebraska Private in the Philippine War, edited by Thomas Solevad Nielsen, (Nebraska: Lur Publications, Danish Immigrant Archive, Dana College, 2001), 98-99.

The fact that he has been brought to Cavite from Hong Kong by the Americans implies the ongoing conflict between the Filipinos and the American colonizers, highlighting the tensions between the two groups.",

      "context": ". This is what is being rumored around, but there is no truth to it. Aguinaldo is in Cavite, brought there from Hongkong by the Americans. In the city, the for eigners are getting worried. This is an absurd situation which cannot go on any longer. Tomorrow the ships which have been chartered will leave the river. The trunks are fast and secure and the final pieces of baggage are being put on board. -And what is the news from Europe? -The opinions one hears in the city are that the European powers will provide help. We are confident of Germany. I have received a report from a Hongkong correspondent that a naval battle can be expected. Details of the expected American defeat are not yet known, and Europe is preparing to in tervene at the earliest opportunity. 143 Letter of Henry Thompson to his parents dated 8 February 1899, published in Inside the Fighting First: Papers of a Nebraska Private in the Philippine War, edited by Thomas Solevad Nielsen, (Nebraska: Lur Publications, Danish Immigrant Archive, Dana College, 2001), 98-99. Thomas Nielsen’s “Inside the Fighting First: Papers of a Nebraska Private in the Philippine War” contains Private Henry O. Thompson’s letters and diary entries during the course of the Philippine-American War. After Thompson’s death, his family donated the materials to the Danish Immigrant Archive at Dana College, Nebraska. Thomas Neilsen, editor from the archive, work on the materials and submit the edited version to the Lur Publications. Private Thompson left his farming life to volunteer for the Pacific Battle as part of the Co K, 1 st Regiment Nebraska V olunteers. Henry Thompson’s letters were unedited resulting in the presence of errors. Although there were grammatical errors, the unedited version reflected more the voice of the writer. Nielsen at tributed the grammatical and spelling errors to Private Thompson’s shift from the Danish to the English language. Private Thompson was born to Danish immigrant parents. In one of the letters addressed to his parents, Private Thompson’s narrated their company encounter with the Filipinos on 4 February 1899. The letter corroborated Private William Grayson’s account. Most of the historical accounts had used the testimony of Private Grayson to present the start of the Philippine-American War. While the of ficial report of the government blamed the Filipinos, the letter of Private Thompson and the testimony of Private Grayson at tested that their group fired the first shot. Dear Parents, I will write a few lines to you to let you know that I am well after the fight we had last Saturday night, and all Sunday and Monday afternoon. I tell you we had a hot time fighting those black in surgents. But, we made them run just like jackrabbits. Then shot them as fast as we could. Our guns were so hot that we burned our fingers on them. Today we have the in surgents clear back to the mountains. How many we have killed of them I don’t know, but they say from 5 to 10 thousand of them. Out of Co M we had 1 man killed. His name is Guy Livingstone of Pallesmouth, Nebraska. We had 3 wounded, but not bad. Our company made a charge Sunday morning just as it was getting light, on bamboo thicket which was full of in surgents. Next day they found 80 in surgents killed there. I can tell you that Cornie Egan of St. Edwards got killed Sunday morning. Now I will tell you what time the fight started. On outpost Number 2 and Post 2, there is where the first shot was fired by a Nebraskan boy of Co. D. He shot and killed an in surgent lieutenant who was coming up the road with some other in surgents. They wouldn’t halt when the guard called to them to, so he had to shoot them. Then you ought to have heard the bugles blow the call to arms. And the in surgents started to shoot as fast as they could all around us. It was then 9 o’clock Saturday evening. Kept the fight up for about 2 hours. Then it stopped, but to begin again at 3 o’clock Sunday morning and kept it going all day until 3 o’clock in the afternoon. When we had made the in surgent’s retreat, it was 11 o’clock. We had to drive them out of a blockhouse and of the bridge. We done by 11 o’clock. Then it went along all right. The in surgents retreated as fast they could back about 2 miles. There we stopped for a rest in the 144 buildings that they just left. Then we got a little piece of bread to eat. We had not anything to eat since Saturday night. We were tired and sleepy. Some of us lay down to sleep right on the ground with our heads on our haversacks, which had a few bullets in them yet. The Tennessee’s one battalion of them came after us and they started after the in surgents then. And 6 in surgents jumped out of teh road and held up their hands, and a white flag. But the Tennessee’s just shot them before they could say a word. We got a lot of prisoners. All day Monday our company had to bury the dead in surgents around block house no. 7 we buried over 20 of them – 3 or 4 in each grave. I guess you have read all about the war in the papers before you get this letter so you know how many we have killed. I have not got much time to write now. I have been up all the time since Saturday morning until Tuesday night was the first night that I slept all night with out getting up and going around on guard. I look so dirty and tired that if you could see me you wouldn’t know me. All the boys look alike. We ain’t had time to wash for 2 days and 3 nights in which time we was in fight. Well I will tell you about it when I come home. Well I got a chance to shoot at a Filipino., if I didn’t get a shot at a Spaniard. One thing I don’t know that is how many I shot and killed. Well that is all. I am well. Good bye. My best regards to all of you, Henry 145 Correspondences relating to the War with Spain and Conditions Growing out of the same, Including the Insurrection in the Philippine Islands and the China Relief Expedition Between the Adjutant-General of the Army and Military Commanders in the United States, Cuba, Porto Rico, China, and the Philippine Islands, from April 15,1898 to July 30, 1902.

The Americans belittled the Philippine in cident as an in surrection, hence the title of the compilation. However, the Filipinos considered it as a war. The Anti-Imperialists would call it a war of criminal aggression. Some of the military documents in cluded in this compilation are in cident reports during the Philippine-American War, such as the encounter between the American and Filipino for ces on the night of 4 February 1899. The reports of Philippine Military Governor Elwell Otis to the Adjutant-General as well as that of Secretary Elihu Root to the President were both brief. It is apparent in the letter of Governor Elwell Otis dated 5 February 1899 that he blamed the Filipinos as in stigators of the war. Hence, since his report was what the United States Army Adjutant-General received, this report in turn became the basis of Secretary of War Elihu Root’s report to President William Mc Kinley. These two reports, however, are contradictory to the account of Private William Grayson and the letter of Private Henry Thompson. General Otis’ in cident report to the Adjutant-General in Washington dated 5 February 1899, saying that the in surgents at tacked the Americans. Insurgents in large force opened at tack on our outer lines at 8:45 last evening. Renewed at tack several times during night. At 4 o’clock this morning entire line engaged. All at tacked repulsed. At daybreak advanced against in surgents and have driven them beyond the lines they for merly occupied, capturing several villages and their defense works. Insurgents loss in dead and wounded large. Our own casualties thus far estimated at 175, very fatal few. We are still driving enemy and think we shall punish them severely. Troops enthusiastic and acting fearlessly. Navy did splendid execution on flanks of enemy. City held in check and absolute quiet prevails. Believe that in surgent army at tacked contrary wishes of their government. Insurgents have secured good many Mauser rifles, a few field pieces, and quick firing guns, with ammunition, during last month. The of ficial report that reached the President of the United States, written by Secretary of War Elihu Root stated that 146 On the night of February 4 th, two days before the U. S. Senate approved the treaty, an army of Tagalogs, a tribe in habiting the central part of Luzon, under the leadership of Aguinaldo, a Chinese half-breed, at tacked, in vastly superior numbers, our little army in the possession of Manila, and after a desperate and bloody fight was repulsed in every direction. 147 Liberty Poems. James West Company, 1900, pp 13-15; 63-64 In June 1900, The James West Company of Boston had published a book entitled Liberty Poems. It was a collection of poems written by notable anti-imperialists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Ernest Crosby, William Vaughn Moody, James Dooling, Clarence Hawkes, W. A. Croffut and others. Some were published in the Anti-Imperialist League newspapers such as Boston Evening Transcript, Sunday Republican, Springfield Republican. Inscribed on the cover of the book was “in spired by the crisis of 1898-1900” and was “made for the New England Anti-Imperialist League,” through the efforts of the “supporters of the cause of freedom.” What was noticeable in the poems were some of the words used by the soldiers in their letters. Included in the rhetoric of the writers were words like “jack-rabbit,” “goo-goos,” “Injun,” “nigger” in referring to the Filipinos and or ders like “take no prisoners,” and “spare no one” and some soldiers terms like “war is hell,” “war is fun.” In addition, the anti-imperialists wrote about the experiences of the soldiers in the field as narrated by the soldiers to their loved ones. One particular entry was Ernest Crosby’s The Pirate Flag, which talks about the soldiers accounts about the war as fun, about the looting, about the burning of villages, and about the manslaughter. Crosby wrote about the or ders of of ficers, who despite the waging of white flag of the revolutionary for ces, they still killed them because of the “no prisoners” policy during the war. Crosby also alluded to the looting and the plunder that the soldiers, whom he called as “Blue-jackets and marines” in the Philippines. In one stanza, Crosby parodied the men who did the lootings and the killings mistaking them as pirates where in reality, “they were Dewey’s men.” The Pirate’s Flag By Ernest Crosby And then around me fore and aft The guns began to roar, And flames sprang up and soon enwrapped A village on the shore. I took my glass, and clearly saw Women and children run, While soldiers in the palms behind Were potting them for fun. 148 Far to the left some dusky men Fought bravely on a knoll; But, overcome at last, they raised A white rag on a pole. Yet still the soldiers shot them down; And I could almost hear Their laughter as they seemed to shout, “No prisoners wanted here!” Then, when the last defender fell, The men rushed in with glee; And from each house they came with loads Of plunder, sad to see. And soon we sent a boat ashore, Blue-jackets and marines, To get our share of loot and swag, And spoil the Philippines. I turned and asked a sailor lad, For now they stood at ease, What pirates we might chance to be Who plagued these summer seas. “Oh, we’re no pirates,” he replied. Don’t ask me that again. This is a ship of Uncle Sam, And we are Dewey’s men.” “But how is that?” I said once more. “Where are your stripes and stars? And does that inky flag up there 149 Belong to honest tars?” “To tell the truth, it’s rather queer,” Replied embarrassed Jack. “But something in the climate here Has turned Old Glory black"

Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation 4. Our Campaign for Independence 5. The Corner Stone of Philippine Independence 6. The Jones Law of 1916 7. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 8. Diary of Carrie Chapman 9. The Philippine Independence Act 152 INTRODUCTORY ESSAY FOR THE AMERICAN PERIOD IN THE PHILIPPINES The readings are designed to of fer to the students the primary sources that will provide them the context to be able to understand the narrative of the American occupation of the Philippines. Presented in chronological or der, the collection will let them read first the “Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898.” This peace agreement allowed the United States to gain possession of the Philippine Islands. The next reading material is “Mc Kinley’s Prayer.” The significance of this excerpt is that it gives an in sider’s view of how President Mc Kinley arrived at his decision to issue his famous “Benevolent Assimilation” Policy. Citing that it was God’s will that the US should annex the Philippine Islands after praying hard supported the idea that occupying the Philippine islands had a blessing from God and should be seen from the vantage point of the Christian zeal of missionary work by way of spreading the good news to the natives of the archipelago. The Philippine Bill of 1902 guides the students to appreciate one of the most important decrees enacted by the American government in the Philippines. They will realize that the most important element contained in the bill was the clause that called for the creation of a lower legislative branch with elected Filipino representatives as legislators that will comprise the Philippine Assembly. The next reading presents an excerpt of Gov. General Francis Burton Harrison. This reading depicts the personal view of Harrison on the Filipino leaders and politicians who were emerging as the new leaders of the government as well as the challenges he faced in administering the colony. Following this excerpt is another excerpt from a book written by Filipinos Palma and Kalaw that provides clear in sights and details on why the respective political parties were or ganized in cluding the discussion of their political platforms. The Jones Law of 1916 is the first for mal and of ficial declaration of the United States' commitment to grant in dependence to the Philippines. This Law replaced the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 (Philippine Bill of July 1, 1902) that served as the de facto in itial constitution of the Philippine Islands. The emphasis of this reading is the fact that among the salient provisions of the Autonomy Act of 1916 was the creation of an all Filipino legislature which created the Philippine Senate to replace the Philippine Commission which had served as the upper chamber of the legislature. The next reading is an excerpt from the diary of Carrie Chapman Catt which led to the creation of a movement for women to take up leadership roles in politics. Lastly, a significant reading material for students to read about the American Period is the text of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act of 1934. Known as the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, this was a U. S. law that provided for Philippine in dependence. Because of this, the Filipinos will now be motivated to prepare for the establishment of the Commonwealth government... 153 Treaty of Peace between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain (Treaty of Paris), signed in Paris, December 10, 1898 By the President of the United States of America [Signed in Paris, December 10, 1898] ANNOTATION The Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898, was a peace agreement between Spain and the United States that ended the Spanish-American War.

It also stated that an amount of $20, 000,000 will be paid by the US to Spain after the treaty’s ratification. The treaty did not go into effect until after its ratification. Initially, many American senators did not favor it for they thought of it as unfair to the Filipinos and a manifestation of imperialism. Unfortunately, the Filipino-American hostilities that erupted on 4 February 1899 in the Philippines (known as the “First Shot”) changed the course of the tide. American propaganda made it appear that the Filipinos in stigated the hostility causing the breach of alliance and trust. Two days after, the treaty was ratified with two-thirds of the majority in the US Senate. The American and Spanish governments reckoned the Treaty of Paris as an in strument of Peace, but the Filipinos resented its conclusion and ratification for they were not consulted and considered in its making. Further, the provisions of the treaty were not for the benefit of the Filipinos but the imperialists, in stead. With the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the bitter relations between the Americans and the Filipinos turned bitterer and eventually lead to another episode that was known as the Filipino-American A Proclamation. Whereas, a Treaty of Peace between the United States of America and Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, in the name of her August Son, Don Alfonso XIII, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Paris on the tenth day of December, 1898, the or iginal of which Convention being in the English and Spanish languages, is word for word as follows: THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN REGENT OF SPAIN, IN THE NAME OF HER AUGUST SON DON ALFONSO XIII, desiring to end the 154 state of war now existing between the two countries, have for that purpose appointed as Plenipotentiaries: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WILLIAM R.

This piece of in for mation stemmed from the fact that President Mc Kinley was a devout Methodist Christian and he shared his thoughts with a group of American Methodist dignitaries who visited him at the White House on November 21, 1899. The significance of this excerpt is that it gives an in sider’s view of how President Mc Kinley arrived at his decision to issue his famous “Benevolent Assimilation” Policy. Citing that it was God’s will that the US should annex the Philippine Islands after praying hard supported the idea that occupying the Philippine islands had a blessing from God and should be seen from the vantage point of the Christian zeal of missionary work by way of spreading the good news to the natives of the archipelago. This “divine revelation” would eventually shape the annexation of the Philippine islands to implement America’s imperialist aspirations. Meantime the question of what to do with the Philippines was the one which perplexed our authorities in Washington. President Mc Kinley faced it, and sought advice from all parties. Perhaps the fullest unofficial statement he ever made of the way his own conclusion to hold the Islands was reached is contained in his address to a committee of clergymen, as reported in the Christian Advocate by General James. F. Rusling. General Rusling was a member of a committee from a religious gathering in Washington to present resolutions of thanks to President Mc Kinley for courtesies shown its members, and, with Bishop Thomas Bowman, Bishop John F. Hurst, and Drs. Upham and Buckley, met with the President by appointment in his private of fice in the White House for that purpose, November 21, 1899. After a pleasant in terview the members of the committee rose to take their leave. The President detained them to give the following statement: “Before you go I would like to say just a word about the Philippine business. I have been criticized a good deal about the Philippines, but don’t deserve it. The truth is, I didn’t want the Philippines, and when they came to us, as a gift from the gods, I did not know what to do with them. When the Spanish War broke out, Dewey was at Hong-Kong, and I or dered him to go to Manila, and he had to; because, if defeated, he had no place to refit on that side of the globe, and if the Dons were victorious they would likely cross the Pacific and ravage our Oregon and California coasts. And so he had to destroy the Spanish fleet, and did it! But that was as far as I though then. “When I next realized that the Philippines had dropped into our lap, I confess I did not know what to do with them. I sought counsel from all sides – Democrats as well as Republicans – but got little help. I thought first we would take only Manila; then Luzon; then other islands, perhaps, also. I walked the floor of the White house night after night until midnight; and I am not ashamed to to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way – I don’t know 161 hot it was, but it came: (1) That we could not give them back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable; (2) That we could not turn them over to France or Germany—our commercial rivals in the Orient—that would be bad business and discreditable; (3) That we could not leave them to the mselves—they were unfit for self-government—and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than Spain’s was; and (4) That there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and, by God’s grace, do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died. And then I went to bed, and went to sleep, and slept soundly, and the next morning I sent for the chief engineer of the War Department (ou map-maker), and told hi, to put the Philippines on the map of the United States (pointing to a large map on the wall of his of fice); and there they are, and there will stay while I am President!” The American occupation of the Philippines was undertaken with motives as humane and disinterested as those which drove us to war with Spain at first. The fact is, that the hour of destiny had struck. The for bearance of a just God was exhausted. Spain must dispossessed of territories which she had ruled with force and cruelty. A new or der must begin. 162 Benevolent Assimilation Policy Declaration EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 21, 1898. ANNOTATION On Dec. 21, 1898, President Mc Kinley issued the BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION PROCLAMATION, announced in the Philippines on Jan. 4, 1899, which stated the U. S.' \"humane\" mission in acquiring the Philippines. He emphasized that the U. S. have \"come, not as in vaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employment, and their personal and religious rights.\" He proclaimed after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, asserting that the “military government maintained in Manila is to be extended to the whole Philippine islands and that the United States government assumes full control and sovereignty of the Spanish government over the Philippines. After a lengthy debate, the U. S congress ratified the treaty on February 6, 1899. Moreover, the U. S. wanted to \"win the confidence, respect, and affection of the in habitants of the Philippines by assuring them in every possible way that full measure of in dividual rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule.\" From the proclamation itself, President Mc Kinley had denied the very concept of the declaration of war against Spain by deciding to annex the Philippines. The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila by the United States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Dewey, followed by the reduction of the city and the surrender of the Spanish for ces, practically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the suspension of the Spanish sovereignity the rein"

The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila by the United States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Dewey, followed by the reduction of the city and the surrender of the Spanish for ces, practically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the suspension of the Spanish sovereignity the rein. With the signature of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at Paris on the 10 th in stant, and as a result of the victories of American arms, the future control, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands are ceded to the United States. In the fulfillment of the rights of sovereignty thus acquired and the responsible obligations of government thus assumed, the actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the Philippine Islands becomes immediately necessary, and the military government heretofore maintained by the united states in the city, harbor, and bay of Manila is to be extended with all possible dispatch to the whole of the ceded territory. In performing this duty the military commander of the United States is enjoined to make known to the in habitants of the Philippine Islands that in succeeding to the sovereignity of Spain, in severing the for mer political relations, and in establishing a new political power, the authority of the United States is to be exerted for the securing of the persons and property of the people of the islands and for the confirmation of all their private rights and relations. It will be the duty of the commander of the for ces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not as in vaders or 163 conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission, co-operate with the Government of the United States to give effect to these beneficent purposes will receive the reward of its support and protection. All others will be brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness if need be, but with out severity, so far as possible. Within the absolute domain of military authority, which necessarily is and must remain supreme in the ceded territory until the legislation of the United States shall otherwise provide, the municipal laws of the territory in respect to private rights and property and the repression of crime are to be considered as continuing in force, and to be administered by the or dinary tribunals, so far as practicable. The operations of civil and municipal government are to be performed by such of ficers as may accept the supremacy of the United States by taking the oath of allegiance, or by of ficers chosen, as far as practicable, from the in habitants of the islands. While the control of all the public property and the revenues of the state passes with the cession, and while the use and management of all public means of transportation are necessarily reserved to the authority of the United States, private property, whether belonging to in dividuals or corporations, is to be respected except for cause duly established. The taxes and duties heretofore payable by the in habitants to the late government become payable to the authorities of the United States unless it be seen fit to substitute for them other reasonable rates or modes of contribution to the expenses of government, whether general or local. If private property be taken for military use, it shall be paid for when possible in cash, at a fair valuation, and when payment in cash is not practicable, receipts are to be given. All ports and places in the Philippine Islands in the actual possession of the land and naval for ces of the United States will be opened to the commerce of all friendly nations. All goods and wares not prohibited for military reasons by due announcement of the military authority will be admitted upon payment of such duties and other charges as shall be in force at the time of their importation. Finally, it should be the earnest wish and paramount aim of the military administration to win the confidence, respect, and affection of the in habitants of the Philippines by assuring them in every possible way that full measure of in dividual rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule. In the fulfillment of this high mission, supporting the temperate administration of affairs for the greatest good of the governed, there must be sedulously maintained the strong arm of authority, to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles to the bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government upon the people of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of the United States.

It was the in auguration of the First Philippine Assembly in 1907 that paved the way for the country’s in dependence from American rule as it provided the Filipino legislators to have hands-on experience in the local political affairs. This event was very significant in the history of Philippine politics since this event also witnessed the first national election in our country through popular votes. The Filipinos’ aspirations for greater political participation and their thirst for self-rule were realized in the establishment of the Philippine legislature. This glorious victory of the Filipinos was accompanied by enormous responsibilities because they have to prove to the U. S Congress, the in ternational community, and to the Filipino nation that the Filipinos could govern the mselves properly and dutifully. THE FEDERAL PARTY IS ORGANIZED Since the beginning of the Filipino American War there had been a small group of Filipinos who were opposed to it. These remained in Manila since the commencement of hostilities and did not take part in the risk of the campaign, some of them believing in good faith that it was a mistake and that it was foolish to fight against for ces a hundred times superior. From among these Filipinos the Commission recruited its followers and advisers. Later on, some of the politicians who had been followers of Aguinaldo, and had taken refuge in the amnesty proclamation, joined this small nucleus, perhaps because they were convinced that to continue resistance would merely weaken the country materially and economically, and that it was more prudent because of pressure of circumstances, to temporarily renounce the political ideal that they had espoused. With the Filipino troop dispersed and the consequent surrender of many of their generals; with the first acts of the Commission that bore signs of democracy and the desire to count with public opinion in the making of the laws; with the reelection of Mc Kinley that assured the continuance of his policy for another four years, and, lastly, with the proclamation of General Mc Arthur threatening the Filipinos in arms with a series of cruel and severe penalties the group of conservative Filipino saw that the time had come to act, and they or ganized a political party under the name of Federal Party. The principal object of the 165 party was to hasten general peace in all the provinces and then to establish a territorial government which in time would make possible the admission of the Islands as a State of the North American Union. It was with unfeigned satisfaction that the Commission welcomed the or ganization of this party. It was not only a clear proof that their reassuring reports to Washington were founded on fact; it made it easier for them besides to carry out their plan of retaining the Islands in definitely. The possibility of making the Islands a state of the American union was a hand some pretext with which to drive away the idea of in dependence so deeply imbedded in the minds of the Filipinos. It was for this reason that the Commission lent most cordial and decided support to the Federal Party and its dignitaries, and it placed at their disposal all the facilities and means available under a state of actual war with which to carry out their propaganda ends. In the Commission’s phraseology, the Federal Party spread thru out the Islands with lightning like rapidity; but it spread not on account of the principles it stood for, but rather because of the spoils and benefits that it might be able to divide among those enlisting in its ranks. The hardships of the military rule under which many families were groaning, coupled with the enticing of fers of honors and recompense from the government coffers, was the magnificent combination that had the effect of greatly weakening the resistance of the most valiant exponents of in dependence. The Federal Party was victorious all along the lines and rightly could it boast at the time of its easy conquests. It had with it the cream and the flower of plutocracy and the country’s aristocracy of talent, at the same time that it enjoyed unlimited power, confidence, and in fluence in the councils of the new government. Without losing time, the Commission or ganized the municipal governments, and soon afterwards the provincial governments. This furnished the occasion for a triumphal trip of the Commission from one province to another, familiarizing the mselves with men and things, mixing socially with the Filipinos, in for ming them of the Commission’s benevolent mission and promising them, like kindly guardians, a greater degree of popular government if they would conduct the mselves as became good wards. 6 The lesson, however, was not mastered so easily by such provinces as Cavite, Batangas, Cebu, and Samar where the civil governments had to be turned over to the military; but on the whole it can be said that the rest of the provinces behaved in the manner expected of them. Hence it was that the Commission, complying with its mission of peace, or ganized the central civil government on July 4, 1901, in spite of the in trigues of the military who would not relinquish hold of the government so easily in favor of others.

Fourth. —Admission of Philippine products into the United States customs free. Fifth. Protective legislation for the Philippine in dustries. A committee of three was appointed to lay this program before Governor Wright, who was acting in the absence of Mr. Taft. It is said that Governor Wright, upon learning the purpose of the committee, knitted his brow in displeasure and flatly refused to give his assent to the program. Although aggrieved by Governor Wright’s reception, the Nacionalistas were not discouraged, and when Mr. Taft arrived they named another committee to see him. Mr. Taft was more diplomatic as to form than Mr. Wright, but was just as unyielding as to substance. In his opinion, the propaganda of the Nacionalista party would stir up the fires of the in surrection anew and would kill the party itself. It would be impossible to prevent the authorities from suspecting the Nationalists from within and confusing them with the brigands out in the field. Along similar lines, Mr. Taft addressed the committee. He took care to suggest, however, that if the word “in dependence” were eliminated from the program, he would have no objection to recognizing the new party. Debates and doubts ensued among the or ganizers of the party, but in the end the opinion prevailed that the grapes were still green and must be allowed to ripen; they, the refore, retreated to their or iginal position of watchful waiting. It was 167 impossible, however, for the Federalists’ error to continue blindfolding the country for any length of time. The Saint Louis Exposition of 1904 which in duced many Filipinos to visit the United States, gave the Federal Party a lesson which it would not even admit when Mabini made them see the impossibility of their platform. There was not a single American who seriously favored the annexation of the Philippines. To them, such annexation was precluded by the distance of the Islands and by the customs of the Filipinos that were to tally different. Many of the prominent “Federalists” who had gone to the United States in the honest belief that their platform had some merit to it, came back confused and disheartened. The panacea they had administered on the country was a fatal one, and could not cure it, so that the party found itself in a very embarrassing position which not even the changes, subsequently adopted, were able to remedy. The Nacionalistas took advantage of the opportunity and came out in the open. The state of war that had silenced them there to fore and prevented the carrying out of any propaganda for the party, had ceased to exist. There was nothing in the or ganic law prohibiting their working in a peaceful manner for the in dependence of the country. The Census had been completed and two years later the elections for the first Philippine Assembly was to be held. Herein we have to do justice to the American people. The liberal spirt of their Constitution which allows no barriers to free thought and its free expression, had made it possible for the Filipinos to campaign peacefully for their in dependence and to provide the ways and means necessary to obtain it. No other people has permitted a similar liberty to the in habitants of a territory under its sway. Thus it was that the Nacionalistas, in or ganizing their party, never lost sight of, nor have they ever failed to recognize, this generosity on the part of the American people and their representatives in the Islands. Thus it was also that the leaders of the Nacionalistas never have shown an at titude of arrogance or of challenge even in the most trying situations, but in stead they have placed the mselves in the position of one merely complying with a duty dictated by the voice of the people. They considered the mselves as trustees of the ideals of the Revolution, who were in duty bound to continue the works of those who had fallen. In all their campaigns they limited the mselves to showing to the American people and their representatives here that the cause of in dependence had not ceased to have followers in the country, and that, in spite of the personal liberties grant the Filipinos and the participation given them in the different branches of the government, they still cherished the ambition to have their own nationality and their own government under their own laws. In no manner were they impeded by the Government in their or ganization, but while there were no impediments from that end, there were many when the time arrived for the heads of the or ganization to come to an understanding. Because of this lack of understanding the Nacionalistas 168 became divided into various groups, the dividing line between each of which they the mselves were unable to delineate. They lost much time discussing the clauses and planks of their respective platforms, until, on the eve of the election, the apprehension of a common disaster made them reunite, but only temporarily, because after their victory at the polls they fell to disputing again among the mselves. 169 Excerpt from Harrison, Francis Burton.

S. congressman from 1903 to 1905 and from 1907 to 1912, and in 1916 President Woodrow Wilson appointed him Governor-General of the Philippines. As a fervent anti-imperialist and opponent of “Dollar Diplomacy,” Harrison speeded up the filipinization of civil service posts, in troduced reforms to ward self-government, and espoused the Democrat program to give early in dependence to the Philippines. The Democrats lost in the elections of 1920, but Harrison returned to Manila in 1935 to serve as a presidential adviser to President Manuel L. Quezon under the Philippine Commonwealth. He was also an adviser to the Philippine government-in- exile during World War II, as well as to Presidents Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, and Ramon Magsaysay. At his request, Harrison was buried in the Philippines. The excerpt depicts the personal view of Harrison on the Filipino leaders and politicians who were emerging as the new leaders of the government.

CHAPTER V Filipinos in Control of Legislature It is not my in tention to write here a history of the Philippine Government during the past eight years. As a participant in the work of that administration I could not, in all probability, write impartially of it. The records are all there, and it is too soon to pronounce final judgment. Those of us who have been connected with the administration have many times given public expression to our purposes and public record to our explanations. Most of it is already embalmed in the mortuary of government reports on file in Washington and Manila. Some Filipino historian in the years to come will probably, from the angle of vision afforded those who come after us, go through the musty records of the past, and give to this period a few chapters in a history of the Philippines. My hope is that in this volume I may contribute something of in terest to the world-wide discussion concerning the capacity of the tropical races for self-government, as observed by one who has been engaged in giving to the Filipinos the fullest possible opportunity to demonstrate such capacity. If for this purpose government records and statistics are quoted, it will be in the endeavor to show to what an extent the Philippines have developed politically, economically, and otherwise materially, under their own government. (60) 170 It is impossible, however, to avoid frequent reference to the governor-general and his relation to the general situation; his position is by tradition the very nerve-center of Philippine administration, and he is given by law very full powers of supervision and control. It was one of my purposes to assign gradually to the proper functionaries the responsibilities which should be the irs. The Governor-General of the Philippines receives a salary of $18,000 a year from the Insular Treasury, and the residence known as Malacañang Palace in Manila is set aside for his use. The salary had been $21,000, but was reduced, at my in sistence and against the wishes of members of the Legislature, during my first weeks of of fice, when for reasons of vitally necessary economy other salaries were being cut. The salaries of the Governor of Hong-Kong and the Governor-General of Java are about three times as high; of the Governor General of British India about four or five times as much. It costs the Governor-General of the Philippines from twice to four times his salary to live in Malacañang, according to his disposition in the matters of entertaining and general style of living. No motor-car is furnished him, and no servants, but he has free light and water and a cottage allowed him in the mountains in Baguio, known as the Mansion House. Free music is provided for entertainments in Manila, furnished by the Constabulary Band. Before leaving I was in strumental in arranging that the appropriation bill should provide for the ''entertainment of distinguished guests\" out of the $100,000 appropriated in the General Purpose funds, when \"approved by the Council of State.\" This should lighten the financial (61) burden of my successor. It was made use of once in my last few months of of fice to the amount of about $3000, to pay for the extraordinary expenditures necessary for entertainment at Malacañang of the visitors who were members of the Congressional party. Malacañang Palace is one of the most comfortable and delightful homes in the tropics. The Spaniards were the best of all the European races as builders in the hot countries, perhaps because they learned how to build in their own. The English make the mselves miserable in the tropics by reproducing in every respect possible the houses and methods of life of their own cold climate. Malacañang was or iginally purchased by the Spanish Government about a century ago as a casita or country house, and has been added to from time to time until it has now a huge floor space of old hand-hewn hardwood, and is admirably fitted for large entertainments. The balcony projects over the swiftly flowing Pasig River, and there is generally a pleasant breeze there, even during the hottest weather. The the rmometer in my room generally stood at 83°, and seldom went below 76° or above 89°. The gardens along the river are noted for the fairy-land illumination displayed at evening entertainments. Malacañang has been greatly enlarged and modernized in the last few years, and a beautiful new executive of fice building in the garden has just been completed"

Malacañang has been greatly enlarged and modernized in the last few years, and a beautiful new executive of fice building in the garden has just been completed. In the disastrous earthquake of 1865 the big stone palace of the governor-general, on what is now Plaza Mc Kinley, was to tally destroyed, and the governor-general moved temporarily into Malacañang; like so much else that the Spanish in tended as temporary, it has become his permanent residence. When I settled (62)in Malacañang I was the ninety-fifth governor-general, and served in that position for seven and a half years, or longer than any one of the forty-four who had directly preceded me, dating back to the eighteenth century. The governor-general has an of fice in Malacañang, but when he was also President of the Philippine Commission, which 171 sat daily during the Legislative sessions, it was customary for him to go to the Ayuntamiento, or City Hall, every day for his of fice work. It was frequently charged that in my first months of of fice I would not consult with \"the Americans\"; so far as I am aware, I saw all Americans who wished to advise with me,—in deed, gave hours to that service, day after day, year after year. The real difficulty was that I did not always take the advice, not of “the Americans,\" but of certain Americans who had composed what had been popularly known as the \"kitchen cabinet,\" or \"polo cabinet\" of recent years. Few of them held of ficial positions, and many of them seemed to me to be in spired by private financial in terests rather than the public in terest. Anyone who has ever held public executive of fice will know how very great a part of his time is occupied in seeing people and receiving advice. This is particularly so in the Philippines, where for ages a paternal government had been conducted, with the governor-general, whether by law or custom, the head and center of it all. Week after week my time was occupied with receiving complaints, advice, or requests, of ten from the same people again and again. Finally I came to feel that my of fice was not unlike that of a medical man: persons came to me only when in trouble, and for consultation and relief. (63) At the very beginning I made of record the fact that I had come to govern the islands in consultation also with the Filipinos. I was thus brought into immediate and daily contact with Mr. Sergio Osmena, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, president of the Nacionalista party and the leading representative of the Filipino people. This remarkable man had already been Speaker for five years, and still holds that of fice. I found him extremely well in for med, not only about Philippine affairs, but about American history and Constitutional law. Wise, astute, and cautious, of an impressive personality, he was also possessed of most remarkable courteous good manners, which never failed him. For the past thirteen years he and Mr. Quezon have been the dominant personalities in Philippine politics. I have never heard either of them speak a word of criticism or ill-will against the United States or the American people, and only very rarely against an in dividual American. They have always had a faith in our country and an appreciation of what our country has done for their people far above the p e t t y l e v e l o f political and racial feelings in Manila. Our first duty was to select for recommendation to the President the names of the new Filipino majority in the commission which was promised by his message. Mr. Osmena furnished a list of a dozen names, and we proposed to submit them for approval to the Philippine Assembly, so that all the elected representatives of the people might have a share in the selection, but this plan was vetoed by the Secretary of War. I then consulted Chief Justice Arellano, Resident Commissioners Quezon and Earnshaw, and Colonel Harbord, (65) Chief of Constabulary. The five names agreed upon were cabled to the Secretary of War, and the commissioners were shortly nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, as follows: Victorino Mapa of Iloilo as Secretary of Finance and Justice; Rafael Palma of Manila, for several years already a member of the commission, for reappointment; Vicente Ilustre of 172 Batangas; Jaime de Veyra of Leyte and Vicente Singson-Encarnacion of Ilocos Sur. Palma and De Veyra were members of the Nacionalista party, Mapa sympathetically in clined to that party, Ilustre an in dependent, and Singson the leader of the Progresista party in the House of Representatives. For nearly three years, until the change of government under the Jones Act, we worked. Together through seasons of political excitement and turmoil with perfect harmony and mutual good-will. It may serve to illustrate the types of older Filipino leaders to describe these commissioners here. Secretary Mapa, who sat for twelve years upon the Philippine Supreme Court bench, is short of stature and dignified in demeanor. He served in Spanish days as Alcalde (or Mayor) of the City of Iloilo. His courtesy and modesty are so great that none but his in timate friends know his rare sense of humor and fund of anecdotes and proverbs. Some of his best stories are of playing tresillo (cards) with Governor-General Weyler, who was a short man like himself, with a terrific military reputation and menacing gestures; Mr. Mapa in cidentally points out that General Weyler in all his long life had never once been under fire himself. As a member of the commission, Mr. Mapa's services were in valuable; nobody in the islands has a better (66) legal mind, and he was constantly appealed to by hisbcolleagues for his opinion on all legal points, never of fering his advice in general discussions until it was asked"

He was generous and kindly always, but in a parliamentary fight, once he had made up his mind, he was absolutely fearless, a veritable little Lion of Justice. His face is like an engraving of a French statesman of the seventeenth century, and his sense of honor and fair play are above all party or political considerations. He was recently made Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to succeed the late Chief Justice Cavetona Arellano, but had to resign his position before a year of in cumbency, on account of ill-health. Rafael Palma is generally considered the third man in Filipino politics. His somewhat severe and melancholy face frequently lights up with an unexpected and sunny smile, as his sense of humor is pronounced. He has a good legal mind, rare literary ability, and a talent for public speaking; and he speaks in the choicest Spanish. He is modest and in dustrious, and a loyal party man, upon whom a large part of the burden of party management was placed by Speaker Osmena. His service in the House of Representatives, the commission, the Philippine Senate, and on the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines has been marked by absolute in tegrity and by a devotion to the cause of public in struction. As Secretary of the Interior he handled successfully many of the most delicate problems of the Government. Just and fair, he is popular with Americans and Filipinos alike. Being a very poor man, he has recently retired from the cabinet to enter business, as he has, in the Filipino fashion, a large and growing family. (67) Jaime de Veyra was governor of the great province of Leyte during the troublesome days of the uprising of the pulajans, or outlaws, about fifteen years ago. His literary ability is marked, and illuminates his reports and papers, as he served an apprenticeship as a newspaper editor. He has held of fice in the House of Representatives and the commission and as Secretary of Commerce and Police, and then as Executive Secretary of the Government. His charming wife is a great 173 asset to him, with her facility for making and keeping friends among the American Congressional ladies, since Don Jaime is now one of the two Representatives in Congress from the Philippines. He is of a thick-set figure, somewhat darker than his colleagues, and of a very serious turn of mind, rarely smiling or talking except when he has something to say, when he develops a rather unexpected eloquence. He is extremely tender-hearted and in clined to sentiment. Vicente Illustre has dark and handsome features, and is possessed of much dignity and grace of manner. He served as a member of the Revolutionary Junta in Hong-Kong during the in surrection, and since then has practised law and watched over his sugar plantations in Batangas. He came from private life to the commission, where he did arduous and valuable work in drafting the laws for the reformation of the Justice of the Peace service, and also the new code for the government of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, in 1914. He, like Mr. Mapa and Mr. Singson, has considerable wealth, and lives in a luxurious home surrounded with all comforts and with works of art. Mr. Ilustre was always something of an in surrecto in politics, and though he gained a seat for the short term in the Sen- (67) ate, in 1916, he was ousted by his opponent in 1918 and has since practised law. He is rather more suspicious of the in tentions of the United States than are his colleagues, and is aggressively in favor of the immediate in dependence of his country. His education was completed in Madrid in the later days of Spanish domination, and he has imbibed there some of the old-world cynicism as to the promises and agreements of nations. Vicente Singson is a tall, slow- moving figure of the mestizo type. He is an able public speaker, and has served in the House of Representatives, the commission, and the Senate. He is a Conservative and his in terests are largely those of business and finance. Humor seldom disturbs his dignity, but his manners are affability and courtesy personified. His talents are those of the world of commerce, rather than of legislative halls, but he is ready and able to advance his views and defend his opinions on all occasions. His presence strengthened the business side of the commission. Like Mr. Palma, he has been to the United States twice, and seems to like American customs and ideas. I find on reading over these descriptive sketches of my first Filipino colleagues that I have stressed the dignity of them all; they are all of the older type and generation, and of them only Mr. Palma speaks English readily; none have had an American public-school education. Dignity of demeanor is essentially an Oriental characteristic,—dignity with an impassive tinge. In the expression of most of the older Filipinos there is a trace of melancholy, as there is in all the Filipino music of older days,—the mark of centuries of service as a subject race. Men of the younger genera- (68)tion, already coming upon the stage in business and public affairs, look full of hope, ambition, and American hustle. U p o n f i r s t acquaintance, Americans are not aware of the sense of fun of the Filipinos; their solemnity is an affair of manner rather than of mind. I remember several meetings of the all-Filipino Council of State in which the bursts of laughter must have disconcerted the of ficials on the other side of the swing doors. Loyal friends, good companions, dependable advisers—I regret leaving them all In public affairs I found them ever conscientious and patriotic, with a fine sense of the respect owed the United States Government, and a due 174 consciousness of obligation to their own people.

Never was an anti-American measure in troduced in tentionally. They realized that the Filipinos were on trial, and that they the mselves were the representatives of their fellow countrymen before the world. Hardly a possible problem of government but came before the commission or the Council of State during these years. I found them in debate, and in the care with which they cast their votes, as full of responsibility and of in telligent understanding as any legislators I have known anywhere. Those departments of government which they had never possessed before, and which were the refore new to them, were studied with the utmost care and deliberation. In later chapters I shall discuss the development of Filipino governmental abilities. Within a few months the membership of the Philippine Commission was completed by President Wilson, and there arrived from the United States the new American members,—Vice-Governor Henderson S. Martin, a progressive Democrat from Kansas, genial and sunny-tempered, with a decided leaning to ward all liberal and democratic ideas; Winfred T. Denison, Secretary of the Interior, sensitive and high-minded, one of the Progressive Republicans from New York, loyally devoted to the principle of Filipino self-government; and Clinton L. Riggs of Baltimore, Secretary of Commerce and Police, a Democrat of the most conservative type, whose bias in favor of the generally accepted standards of colonial government soon earned for him among the resident Americans the nickname of \"the White Hope.\" General Riggs was a most charming social companion, and a most difficult colleague in government. He was, from the very beginning, out of sympathy with the new policy in the Philippines, and, I think, came out with the idea of replacing me when my removal was accomplished by the campaign then under way. He was closely in the confidence of the Secretary of War, who also was greatly disturbed at the reports coming from the Philippines; and although Secretary Garrison subsequently became disgusted with the misinformation about the Philippines which was being disseminated through the United States, and in a spirit of generous in dignation entered into a sharp controversy with Mr. Taft in the public press in defense ofmy administration, I am sure he would, himself, say that he never really sympathized with our radical plans in the Philippines; in deed, it will be remembered that his resignation as Secretary of War was based partly upon his dissatisfaction with the speedy preparations for Philippine in dependence. General Riggs stood firmly upon his in terpretation of the law which gave the governor-general only \"supervision\" of the (70)other department secretaries; he told me that \"supervision\" gave only an advisory power, and no right of in terference in his d e p a r t m e n t, which in cluded the Philippine Constabulary, of which by law the governor-general was commander-in-chief. The Jones Act of 1916 cleared up this controversy by giving the governor- general \" supervision and control\" over all departments of government. During the eighteen months of our controversy, General Riggs and I, after the fashion of Anglo-Saxons, managed to remain, personally and socially, good friends. He went home ill in the summer of 1915, and his resignation was accepted by the President in December of that year. Poor Denison was the of ficial who suffered most from the troublesome political storms of those early days; his was a spontaneous, frank, and sincere nature, and he was genuinely in spired with 175 a desire to bring self-government to the Filipinos. He was not of the stern stuff necessary to face public criticism and abuse. Within his first few months he made a speech at the City Club in Manila in which he advocated giving the Filipinos their rights, or, as he phrased it, \"give them what they want.” He at once became the target for a veritable bombardment of ridicule and abuse from the \"or ganization,\" and his spirit was completely shattered. He left the Philippines a year later, in a most melancholy frame of mind, absolutely broken on the wheel of the \"or ganization's\" criticism. Vice-Governor Martin, of a serene and well-balanceddisposition, rode the waves successfully and rendered excellent service in the commission. His chief work was in the public schools, in founding the Rural Credit Association system, and in drafting and for cing (71)through the charter of the Philippine National Bank. He resigned in the autumn of 1916, and I think has since regretted that he did not remain to carry on the work he liked so well. He was a valuable and much valued pillar of support in our Philippine policy. He was succeeded in June, 1917, by Vice-Governor Charles E. Yeater of Missouri, at the present writing acting Governor-General of the Philippines. To the Filipinos, the majority upon the commission meant that the dead-lock as to appropriations and other important measures would be broken in stantaneously, and that in the selection of their higher of ficials, such as bureau chiefs, and judges of the First Instance, they were to have the controlling vote in the commission, to which, by existing law, such nominations were sent for confirmation. Long-standing grievances which they wished to remove were now in their hands for settlement. Above all, the new policy was a recognition of their political rights and race dignity, for which they showed immediate gratitude"

To the Filipinos, the majority upon the commission meant that the dead-lock as to appropriations and other important measures would be broken in stantaneously, and that in the selection of their higher of ficials, such as bureau chiefs, and judges of the First Instance, they were to have the controlling vote in the commission, to which, by existing law, such nominations were sent for confirmation. Long-standing grievances which they wished to remove were now in their hands for settlement. Above all, the new policy was a recognition of their political rights and race dignity, for which they showed immediate gratitude. The morning after the announcement of the new step for ward, \"La Vanguardia,” the leading Filipino paper, the retofore a very resolute opponent of American policies in the islands, expressed in Spanish the general sentiment editorially under the heading \"Dawn of the New Era\" as follows: Magical Effect of President's Grave and Dignified Message... Complete Disappearance of All Hitherto Existing Prejudices and a Great Improvement in Political Atmosphere. Much has already been said and written in regard to the necessity of a better understanding, of harmony and cooperation, but, hitherto, results have been always negative and all (72)efforts seemed fruitless. Matters went from bad to worse. Now, however, it has been sufficient for the chosen representative of President Wilson to make a simple and frank statement of policy, and the situation as a result is completely changed. These statements have been sufficient to revive in a most admirable and complete manner the faith of Filipinos in the justice of the American people, and all prejudices and misunderstandings that have grown up in the past have 176 been immediately wiped away. As a result, it can be said that since the decided views of the Democratic Administration have been announced never before in our mutual history have respect and consideration of American sovereignty been as firmly rooted in these islands as it is now. The editor of the \"Vanguardia,\" Mr. Alejandro Roces, the most in fluential and in dependent daily publisher in the islands, maintained the same at titude unswervingly during my whole administration. His unselfish patriotism and determined freedom from any of ficial connections lent weight to his opinions. Upon the day after the delivery of the first message to the Legislature—October 16, 1913—the Philippine Assembly gave of ficial expression to similar views in a resolution, reciting the firm stand of the Filipino people for immediate in dependence from the day of the in surrection against Spain in 1896, through all trials and vicissitudes, and their patient confidence that ultimately the United States Government would redress ''all errors and in justices.\" T h e r e s o l u t i o n concluded as follows We believe that, happily, the experiments of imperialism have come to an end, and that colonial exploitation has passed into history. The epoch of mistrust has been closed... A few days have sufficed to bring about a good understanding between Americans and Filipinos, which it had been impossible to establish during the thirteen years past. We are convinced that every on ward step, while relieving the American Government of its responsibilities in the Islands, will, as in the past, fully demonstrate the present capacity of the Filipino people to establish a government of its own and guarantee in a permanent manner the safety under such government of the life, property and liberty of the residents of the Islands, national as well as for eign. We do not wish to say by this that there will not be difficulties and embarrassments. Nor do we even expect that the campaign, open or concealed, of the enemies of the Filipino cause will cease soon, but we feel sure that through a conservative use of the powers entrusted to us, the Filipino people will, with God's favor and the help of America, emerge triumphantly from the test however difficult it may be. A few days later, when the Filipino majority was appointed to the commission, the new commissioners cabled their thanks to the President, accepting the of fices in or der to “aid the work of laying down a basis for a stable, free Filipino Government.\" A joint meeting of the Legislature on October 31, 1913, resolved “that the principle of immediate action has taken the place of the announcement of promises.\" These quotations have been given not only to show the response of the Filipino mind to the new policy, but for the light they cast upon past history in the islands. For a century at least the home government, first of Spain and then of the United States, had, in moments of liberal impulse, promised reforms and made political professions, and then turned to other matters and left the field to the for ces of reaction and in action. 177 The Jones Law of 1916 August 29, 1916 ANNOTATION On August 29, 1916, the Jones Law, or the Act of Congress known as the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, was approved. It was the first for mal and of ficial declaration of the United States' commitment to grant in dependence to the Philippines. US Congressman William Atkinson Jones of Virginia authored the Jones Law. The law provides that the grant of in dependence would come only \"as soon as a stable government can be established\" which gave the United States Government the power to determine when this \"stable government\" has been achieved. It aimed at providing the Filipino people broader domestic autonomy though it reserved certain privileges to the United States (Americans) to protect their sovereign rights and in terests. Jones Law replaced the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 (Philippine Bill of July 1, 1902) that served as the de facto in itial constitution of the Philippine Islands after it was ceded by Spain to the United States by the Treaty of Paris. Among the salient provisions of the Autonomy Act of 1916 was the creation of an all Filipino legislature which created the Philippine Senate to replace the Philippine Commission which had served as the upper chamber of the legislature. The law specified government functions to an executive to be appointed by the U. S President with the consent of the senate, with the title American Governor-General in the Philippines"

Approved, August 29, 1916. 193 The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 ORGANIC ACT AN ACT TEMPORARILY TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 57 th Congress of the United States of America, First Session, 1902 ANNOTATION The Philippine Bill of 1902 is one of the most important decrees enacted by the American government in the Philippines. Entitled “An Act Temporarily to Provide for the Administration of the Affairs of Civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for Other Purposes,” this law contained two important provisions that strengthen both the civil and human rights of the Filipino people and bestowed on them the privilege of legislation. Also known as Cooper Act, it provided a Bill of Rights for the Filipinos that protected their rights: to live, to acquire property, to practice their religion, to be subjected to due process, to exercise their obligations, to enjoy compensations due to them, and freedom of expression. But the most important element contained in the bill was its clauses that called for the creation of a lower legislative branch with elected Filipino representatives as legislators. The bill also stated the American government’s readiness to call for a general election in the islands should in surrection cedes and complete peace is maintained as at tested by the Philippine Commission. The decree mandates the US President to or der the Philippine Commission to perform a census of the islands and make a detailed report about the population and matters about the people that may be deemed by the Commission as necessary, while peace is being upheld. Two years after the publication of the result of the census, and upon the satisfaction of the Philippine Commission and the US President, a general election shall be called and the elected Filipinos, not less than fifty but not greater than one hundred in number, will comprise the Philippine Assembly—the body that will act as the lower house of the legislature in the Philippines. The Filipinos became very cooperative with the promises of fered by the bill. Peace was maintained, a census was conducted and after its publication, an election was held on 30 July 1907 and the assembly was convened and in augurated on 16 October 1907 at the Manila Grand Opera House.

To AUGUST 20 th. 1912- ANNOTATION Carrie Chapman Catt and Dr. Aletta Jacob visited Manila for a three-week visit as part of a worldwide tour. Catt, who led the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and founded the League of Women V oters, was supportive of the Philippine suffrage movement. They met a group of Filipino and American women at the Manila Hotel in 1912. Two of the women were Sofia de Veyra and Pura Villanueva Kalaw. Both were leaders of their respective or ganizations. Pura was the president of the Asociacion Femenista Ilonga and Sofia was a founding member of the Asociacion Femenista Filipina). Eventually, the Society for the Advancement of Women (SAW) was for med with an equal number of Filipino and American founding members before Catt left the Philippines. Catt observed that SAW was the first society in which both Filipinos and Americans were united in work. SAW became the Manila Women’s Club, which later became part of the National Federation of Women’s Clubs. The women in these clubs campaigned tirelessly to get the 300,000 votes from Filipino women for the 1937 Amended Election Law to be passed. This paved the way for women to take up leadership roles in politics. Since then, the Philippines has witnessed the election of two female presidents, and many women have been elected or appointed to positions on a national and local government level. Catt, Carrie Chapman Diaries, July 19-Aug. 20, 1912 Philippines The Women of the Philippines The arrival in Manilla of two leaders of women-Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt of the United States and Dr. Aletta Jacobs of Holland-who come to make in vestigation of the condition of women in the Philippines is a really in teresting event. They come at an opportune time. Social conditions and problems are uppermost in the minds of all who are working for the advancement of the Philippines and if these ladies can contribute anything of value it will be very welcome. They bring to their mission several advantages that weigh even against extended local experience. They are enthusiasts and specialists, they have been studying the affairs and problems of the women in other counters, their eyes are new and they can get contrasts denied to local students. There seems [to be] but one possible criticism of their plan and that is the time they have allotted to their work-it appears in sufficient. But if they are given the maximum of assistance they can cover a great deal of ground and to that end the writer ventures the suggestion that the government, the chiefs of all local in stitutions of women, the of ficers of the local women's societies and all who are in terested in their purpose join in for warding their work. These in vestigators will at the very outset discover many in teresting things about the women of the 218 Philippines. They will quickly discern that they are whole lot better than the men, an advantage by no means limited to mere morals. They excel their men in business, in energy and in dustry, in thrift. They do more for their homes and their families than do their men. They have caught the new spirit of progression that is abroad in the land and have a leading part in it. They are filling the schools and their at tainments in scholarship equal to those of the other sex. They have taken the first steps to ward the professions, notably medicine and nursing, and their work is rich in promise for the future. They have for years been leaders in the local household in dustries and will be an important element in the commercial life of the islands when that sphere is enlarged by the work of the schools and the special efforts that the government is now devoting to it. Speaking in a broad and general sense the writer is in clined to believe that the rights of woman in the Philippines are fairly protected and conserved by both the laws of the land and the family and social customs that obtain. In common with her people, she needs educational, social and material advancement but she will share fully in these advantages as they come. Much is planned for her but perhaps much more can and should be done for her, and if the two in vestigators can be helpful their ideas and suggestions will be welcomed. The cause of suffrage, in which the two visiting ladies are especially in terested, has not been advanced here and conditions would in dicate that the time is not ripe. However, let not us deter; it would be diverting whether practical or not.

SUFFRAGETTES FOR ISLANDS Manila Times, Aug 16, 1912 Mrs. Catt Organizes Local Women for Work Manila is to have an active, fully or ganized woman's suffrage society club. The or ganization of this association was perfected yesterday at the Manila hotel by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, at a meeting held with several of the more prominent American and Filipino women of the city. The association is to be known as the Society of the Advancement of Women and it has four American and four Filipino lady of ficials. Theyare: president, Mrs. C. S. Lobingier; vice president, Senora Victorino Mapa. The minutes of the meetings are to be kept in two languages, Spanish and English. Mrs. Calderon will act as Spanish secretary and Mrs. Saleeby will be the English secretary. Mrs. Goodale is treasurer of the society and there is an advisory committee composed of the following well known ladies: Senora Teodoro Kalaw, Senorita Lopez and Mrs. Quinan. The first meeting of the society will be held on August 29 th, at the home of Mrs. Logingier on Calle San Marcelino. In speaking of the society and its for mation yesterday Mrs. Catt said to a TIMES man this morning: \"The society will, of course take up whatever work it desires, but its first object will be to study the women's suffrage movement. The society already has quite a number of members and they are the most prominent and best women in the city. I feel sure that the or ganization of this society here will do an immense amount of good in more ways than one.\" Asked regarding her impressions of the Philippines and the conditions here, Mrs. Catt, who leaves this evening on the Prinz Sigismund for Hongkong, said: \"I feel that I have been here such 219 a short time that I do not fully understand conditions as I should like to and for that reason am thinking of returning again next year. Personally, I found things very in teresting here. Results are being wrought out here which are going to tell for the hindrance or benefit of every Asiatic country. If the Filipinos are really benefited by the broad system of education which has been in culcated here, if they become imbued with ideas of business honesty, if they become able to handle the large commercial problems and can be trusted with the responsibilities of government, it will have an immense effect on other adjacent countries. \"I have heard from several sources that candidates for political preferment in the provinces have used money and that other corrupt practices have crept in. If such bad customs are kept up, England, France, Germany and the Netherlands will point to that as the final condemnation of the Asiatic countries to govern the mselves, and it is of the upmost importance that the voters of the islands be made to see that and combine in condemning such practices. \"For this reason I think it would be a wise step if the women of the country were given the right to vote for all agree that the women of the islands are more upright and honorable than the men and they would make the men be honest, too.\" Asked what she thought of the immediate in dependence idea, Mrs. Catt said: -\"The people of the islands are much better off under the liberal policy of the United States than if they were given in dependence and all its at tendant dangers. The United States hold the Philippine by as fair a title as any colonies are held by for eign countries; they came to us by the for tunes of war and to give them up would be an act of philanthropy and in dependence should not be given the islands until all the people are educated and their men are more fitted to cope with the political and commercial problems which now beset the archipelago. Independence, moreover, could not be given the islands at this time unless all the nations entered into an agreement to keep hands off under all circumstances and I feel sure that the various nations would not enter into such a covenant. Personally, I should like to see the islands converted into a territory and afterwards into a state, a part of the United States. I think that would be for their best in terests.\" 220 THE PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE ACT (TYDINGS-MCDUFFIE ACT) 1934 AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADOPTION OF A CONSTITUTION AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

Manila, Grand Opera House. 1922. The 1922 legislative elections was an important event in the history of Philippine politics. This is particularly because of the in ternal conflict that caused a split in the Partido Nacionalista, the ruling political party in Philippine Legislature since 1907. The conflict was mainly between the leadership of Sergio Osmeña in the House of Representatives and Manuel Quezon in the Senate. The famous split was announced on February 17, 1922 when the newly-for med party, the Partido Nacionalista-Colectivista in troduced Quezon as its president. It is in this party convention that Manuel Quezon delivered this speech saying that the \"disagreement in the party... is due to nothing else but a difference in opinion that grew wider as days went by.\" He also emphasized the importance of saving one's principles even if it means sacrificing \"everything, even the party itself.\" The split resulted to the defeat of the Nacionalistas in the legislative elections on June 6, 1922. This document is an important reference on Quezon's political life, on the history of the Partido Nacionalista and in the history of Philippine politics. EXCERPT: My loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to my country begins This is a day of transcendental importance to me. l am going to take a step the consequences of which I have for eseen, out the result of which God alone knows. From the time I entered public life I fought under the banner of the Nationalism Party. I affiliated with it at a time when the only words written on its flag were: Immediate Independence. I affiliated with it when the struggle we carried on during the revolution was still fresh in my mind and I thought it my solemn duty to form part of a political or ganization to defend the very same ideals for which the soldiers of the Revolution fought and fell. The Nacionalista Party and the entire Filipino people know how faithfully I have served my party colleagues. Everybody knows how I fought for them within and with out the ranks and that I never hesitated to come to the fore to defend the party's ideals and its men. I want to recall at this moment, with satisfaction and with out regret. how I have always supported and defended hints with all sincerity and even as strongly as his strongest supporters could have done. I defended the party at least as much as the staunchest Nacionalista and the most dyed-in the wool Unipersonalist. But the party never has been and never will be the people. My loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to my country begins. Even if it were not the Nationalism Party, let it be any other party, from the moment that my convictions do not coincide with the ideal For which the party stands, I consider it my duty to leave it. A man to be worthy of the name should put his conviction into practice, profess them with faith, defend them with courage, happen what may. 247 My colleagues of the Nationalism party know that rumor has been spread and broadcast that the disagreement in the party is due to personal ambitions, jealousies and envies. Those who are more in timately linked with the march of events know full well that it is due to nothing else but a difference in opinion that grew wider as days went by. I did not look for the conflict. The conflict was thrust on me. A recent arrival from the United States, the Filipino people know that I had to undergo medical treatment, that my health was broken, that I needed test. I tried to avoid it because I knew that it was going to mean a fight, and I did not want conflict, I wanted harmony, pace. The conflict came in spite of myself. Confronted by it, I had to defend the principles which I sincerely believed were just. After the reorganization of the Lower House, on a more liberal basis than it has eve: been in the past, I in vited pace. I was answered that the fight has not ended. On another occasion again I asked for peace, and again I was answered that the fight was on, and then I was told chat the issue was going to be presented to the convention and that those who shall refuse to abide by the decision of the majority shall be expelled from the parry. You will agree with me, gentlemen, that those who believe with me in the principles of collective leadership because it is their honest conviction were not going to retreat nor surrender. It was a question of principle and conviction and there is no pity on earth that can make them change their views. The convention met. The principles of the collective group were accepted They were accepted so avid the split, a split that at fax they wanted to force but Mach Leer they exerted all efforts to prevent. The in dependence question was brought for ward as argument against the reorganization of a new party. Resignations were tendered. Sacrifices were of fered or nude in or der to maintain the union in the party. The collective the ory of leadership and other collective propositions were accepted and in corporated at the party platform. fliers-thing was taken advantage of for the sake of the unity of the party. Ideas and principles were sacrificed. The motto of the Unipersonality was: Sacrifice all principles, but save the party at all cost! The motto of the Collectivists is: Save the principles and sacrifice everything, even the party itself! We did not look for the division. I did not favor the split. But it exists now, fatal to the country, perhaps, but necessary for the health of the country. My Collectivist colleagues know how much I tried to avoid this conflict especially so when the collective principles were accepted by the Unipersonalists. I was opposed to a division in the party"

My Collectivist colleagues know how much I tried to avoid this conflict especially so when the collective principles were accepted by the Unipersonalists. I was opposed to a division in the party. That is why you must have noticed how the papers spoke of union one day and the next day of a possible split, union the next and a division the following day and so on. The positive fact is that nobody can prevent the split in the Nacionalista Party. It is divided because men who were once united, now disagree on fundamental questions that vitally affect the country. While some are conservatives, others are liberal. and while some are 248 Unipersonalists others are Collectivists. The Nacionalista Party might have in corporated the collective principles but this was because those who are in it saw that it as the only salvation for its men, during the coming elections. The one who over A month ago was an out-and-out Unipersonalist and overnight mined a complete somersault and changed into a Collectivists, cannot profess that faith with sincerity. It is a conviction for convenience, and it cannot and should not be taken at its face value. It is said that there is no difference between the Unipersonal and Collective the or ies. It is a question of mere form, they say. The Unipersonalist who thinks that the present conflicting tendencies are not a sufficient foundation to differentiate one from the other does not either understand the real question at issue or in accepting the Collective principles, accepted them in ching sincerity The difference is fundamental The Collectivists believe in a true government of democracy, not only in form, but also in fact, not the people's rule with out the expression of popular will, but a government by the people by means of a voluntary expression of the sovereign will of that people. The Collectivists want a government of opinion, not a government that solves questions with out the country's knowledge or how or when the solution was made. One of the greatest arguments used against us by our American critics is that we do not have here a government of opinion. But is that a more conclusive proof of the fact that there is public opinion here than the present triumph of the Collective principle of leadership? Is there one who doubts that this question has already been decided by the people? When this question was dismissed for the first time, almost all the papers, with very few exceptions, were in favor of the unipersonal the ory and against the collective principle. What was the effect on the people? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The people decided for the mselves. And this shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that here we have public opinion, courageous, in dependent, unbiased. Those who followed this question with in terest must have seen that the Filipino people is in terested in matters that vitally affect its government, and that is capable of for ming its own opinion, with out the need of tutors or ment ors. I repeat, the entire press of the Philippines was against the collective principle, and when I say press, I refer specially to the so-called in dependent papers. and yet the country declared itself in favor of Collectivism, and such is the force of the avalanche that the Unipersonalists are afraid to own that they are what they say. The question now is: after the acceptance and in clusion of the collective the ory in the Nacionalista platform, should we remain in the party? I have given this subject much thought. I spent sleepless nights pondering over it and this I say in all the seriousness that step such as the one were taking deserves. There are those who believe and affirm that personal ambition and personal in terest are the main consideration in the fight. They said that the one who will head it is there, because he wants to scale the heights of power, and that those who follow him do it not because of principles, but for personal convenience. In all sincerity I want to tell you now that 249 lest our action be translated in that thwarted way, and there are many who are in terested in presenting it thus, I tried my very best to prevent the splot because I do not want that political struggles in this country should be taken as animated by personal motives. Listen to this: The politician who does not have any patriotic purpose but his personal aggrandizement in entering politics, who is only after personal convenience and nothing else is surely after a job, a position. Can I find a position in the Philippine Government and in the gift of the Filipino people higher than that of President of the Senate, the highest position to which a Filipino could be sent by his countrymen? If I wanted to perpetuate myself in power, is there anything better for me than to remain in the Nacionalista Party? But no! I prefer to take the risky side. I prefer to be in a new party that must be or ganized, that will mean sacrifice, work, fight. And the same is true with those who are with mr. There is nothing more comfortable for them than to remain a powerful party to ensure their victory at the polls. But they sustain a principle. They are fighting for their conviction, not for their convenience. One should not belong to a party only to occupy a position so that he may better defend the ideals of the party by means of his position. There are no bad feelings against our for mer colleagues of the Nacionalista Party. We harbor no grudge against them. We give them the same affection. There is no reason in the world why we cannot consider ourselves as brothers. Unless they consider that only who belong to one party can be called brothers, and if that is their conception of unity on a party, I say that is destructive, suicidal. It is not the unity of the party that should be sought. It should rather he the unity of the people"

What a beautiful spectacle for the country to behold political fights limited to discussion of principles eliminating personalities! What a magnificent spectacle for the people to see political opponents eating on the same banquet tables, united by the same links of affection and friendship! Much as I regret it, this seems to be something unknown yet here. Everytime that the people saw the Speaker and myself to gether, immediately the talk goes the rounds that our political differences have been patched up. When we had to asted each other at a banquet in the Ayuntamiento. All the papers said there was peace between the two, not knowing that the next day a big bomb is going to explode. People may ask why it is that this break only takes place now. The reason is simple. When the Nacionalista Party was or ganized, it was an or ganization with the sole purpose of coordinating the for ces of the country to gether for Philippine Independence. It was not called upon to solve political, social, economic matters. All the Filipinos affiliated as Nacionalistas; in time the Nacionalista Party came into power. It found itself then confronted by political, social, and economic problems. It was in vested with legislative power. From that time on differences in 250 opinion began to spring up. You must have noticed that our Senate is liberal and our Lower House, conservative. This is the only country where such a phenomenon takes places with the exception of Australia. The reason is simple and it needs no further comment. That fact exists. There are two tendencies, the conservative and the liberal, and it is for the welfare of the country that there should be two parties or ganized and based on those opposing tendencies. Laws do not make a government democratic or autocratic or have autocratic laws and have democratic government. We have England for example where there is a king and it is a monarchy, yet the workings of its government are democratic. And we have: on the other hand some Latin American countries where their government can be summarized in three points: 1. The government resides in the people; 2. The people delegate their power to a President; 3. The President does what he pleases. I want to tell you, gentlemen, that we have done all that we could to avoid this split. Our efforts failed, the Collectivists believe that union in a party does not mean union of men. It means unity in principles professed and practised. We believe that the or ganization of a new party does not mean the bankruptcy of our National cause, because we hold the Nacionalista Party is not the people. Even if there is a split, we shall work to gether for our complete political emancipation. We have faith in our people, blind, sublime faith in them and we know that no Filipino will be recreant to the legacy bequeathed to him by his for efathers and that all of us to a man will stand in favor of Philipppine Independence, immediate, absolute and complete. We know that the Filipino people, irrespective of party, creed, or religion, will force the issue and compel all party men to work for the realization of our sacred ideals. We divided, but divided in ideas, united in sentiment, united in love of country, divided in the procedure of serving her best. The Unipersonalists are antiquarians: the Collectivists are modern. Even if I wanted to remain in the party, I cannot very well do it. For it would be like mixing oil and water in a glass. We shall need a new house now that we leave our old one. Now we have two strong parties that our hope shall fight ideals and ideals alone, eliminating personalities. 251 Speech of Senate President Manuel Quezon accepting his nomination as President of the Philippines, July 20, 1935.

A party nomination for the highest of fice within the gift of the people is in itself a great distinction, but when the nomination comes under such auspicious circumstances as have at tended that which is now proffered to me, I regard it as the greatest honor that can be accorded to any public man short alone of his actual election to the Presidency. Ever since the approval and acceptance of the Independence Act there has been growing among the people a feeling of deepest concern over the difficult problems and impending responsibilities which will confront us upon the in auguration of the Commonwealth. While the 252 Constitutional Convention was in session, partly fostered by the spirit of national solidarity exhibited by the members of that body, the anxiety to prepare the country adequately to meet these problems and responsibilities became articulate in an in creasingly popular demand for national unity, that political parties give pause to partisan strife, that the leaders of the vital for ces of the nation join in their efforts for the at tainment of the common goal, and that the entire country resolve to support loyally the man who may be entrusted with the national leadership so that through the Government of the Commonwealth the foundations of the future Philippine Republic may be solidly and firmly established. Resolutions were passed by municipal councils as well as by civic and social or ganizations, in cluding labor unions, demanding a coalition of the two great political parties as the most practical means of obtaining this unity of effort. Before the Constitutional Convention adjourned the cry of national unity was taken up by the League of Provincial Governors Without regard to party affiliation and voicing the prevailing sentiment in their respective provinces, these spokesmen of our local governments unanimously joined in the general appeal for unity. Lastly, prominent Filipino business men, professionals and leaders in agriculture, in dustry, and labor for mally submitted to the directorate of the two political parties a concrete proposal that the two parties nominate jointly the candidates for President and Vice President and thus in sure the cooperation of all the vital for ces of the nation during the first and trying the years of the Commonwealth. When the two parties held their respective national conventions they readily responded to this popular clamor and for thwith agreed to form a coalition and to nominate the same candidates for President and Vice President. Neither Senator Osmeña nor I sought these nominations. We made no preconvention campaign nor did we have any desire to secure them. We entered public life about the same time thirty years ago both pledged to the cause of in dependence. The vicissitudes which have been our lot during these years are not now to be recounted but as I look back upon our joint efforts in the at tainment of the goal which we set out before us I feel happy that at the end of the long struggle we can face our people standing on the same platform, our pledge fulfilled, our mutual friendship and regard enhanced, and still enjoying, I hope, their continued confidence and support. With the approval of the Independence Act and its acceptance by the country we believed that our extended public service could at last come to an end. We would have been content as private citizens to lend our unstinted support to the new Government. But it seems that our fellow- citizens have once again chosen to place upon our shoulders the new responsibility of or ganizing the Commonwealth and leading the nation during the early years of its existence. The nomination that has been proffered to us at tains the category of a call to duty which no public-spirited citizen may evade or disregard. I, the refore, Mr. Chairman, make public announcement that I accept the nomination for the Presidency which has been tendered to me, deeming it my bounden duty to do so, and I accept it with the most profound sense of the responsibility that it entails and the deepest feeling of gratitude. 253 Having been nominated under the circumstances I have ment ioned, I cannot afford to speak in uncertain terms. The need of the hour is for fixed or ientation, clear statement of policies, and a definition of the national purposes. In the course of the present campaign I shall have the opportunity to discuss all the important questions before the country. For the present I have to limit myself to a few of them. THE PLATFORM The Coalition platform meets with my wholehearted approval. I took part in the drafting of that document and I make my own every commitment contained the rein. THE CONSTITUTION I look upon the Constitution of the Philippines as the expression of the sovereignty and of the aggregate will of the Filipino people. I shall abide by its provisions. I shall uphold the democratic principle underlying the in stitutions that it establishes. I am opposed to a dictatorship. I maintain that no man who believes in a dictatorship can with safety be entrusted with the reins of executive power under our Constitution. Democracy can only survive if those at the helm of the Government believe in the people’s right to rule and have faith in their in herent capacity to decide rightly important public questions.

I shall safeguard free speech, the freedom of the press, and the equality of every man before the law however poor or ignorant. I shall in sure for every citizen of the Philippines, from Luzon to Mindanao and Sulu, the right to worship God as his own conscience dictates. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH We are entering a new era. We are on the threshold of free nationhood. The Government of the Commonwealth that we shall establish derives its powers from a constitution approved by the people the mselves. It may truly be said that it is a government of our creation to be administered for our own welfare. Except in a few specified cases, it will be free from American control in the conduct of domestic affairs. Only in our for eign relations do we remain subject to American supervision, and this because of the continuing responsibility of the for eign aggression during the life of the Commonwealth. Hence, the Government of the Commonwealth will be, in fact not in name, an in dependent government under the protection of the United States. The immediate task before us is to set up the new Government,–a task that will require all the for esight, the wisdom, and the courage of the people. Then we must adopt such measures as will in sure the stability of our national economy, and provide for the honest and efficient administration of the affairs of the government. Equally important is to make adequate provision for the defense of our country against external aggression or in ternal disorders. 254 I favor a simple and economical government, one in keeping with the limited resources of our country but which is capable of ministering to the needs of the nations. I shall be unsparing in my efforts to carry out the mandate of the Constitution regarding the civil service. Merit and character alone will be the qualification for of fice or promotion. For the highest responsible posts I shall call on the most capable, honest, and patriotic citizens, regardless of political affiliation or religious belief. This is no time for placing party considerations above the common weal. In fact, one of the main purposes of the coalition is to secure the cooperation and help of the best available men to in sure the success of the Commonwealth. I shall to lerate neither corruption nor in efficiency in public of fice. FINANCIAL POLICY The financial stability of the Government depends upon our ability to keep expenses within our in come. At the time when other governments are resorting to loans in or der to meet their obligations we can take pride in the fact that we have been able to maintain a balanced budget. Under our Constitution the responsibility for maintaining a balanced budget falls mainly upon the executive. I pledge myself to maintain the credit of the Government and at all times to balance the budget and keep our finances in a sound condition. I shall keep our present currency system in all its in tegrity and will allow no change that will affect its value. If new conditions should require such a change it will be done only after the most careful study and consultation with competent experts. For the present I can see no reason for any radical modification in our monetary system. TAXATION Irresponsible demagogues have tried to arouse in the hearts of our people the hope that under an in dependent Philippines there shall be no taxes except upon the rich. It is my duty to warn the credulous against such misrepresentation Governments can be supported only through taxation. It is a primary duty of citizens to contribute to the support of the Government, but taxation that does not take into consideration the relative financial ability of the taxpayer is unjust. I favor a complete revision of our Astern of taxation with the best technical advice available. I advocate that the burdens of the state be equitably disputed in proportion to the means and possibilities of the taxpayer. We shall make a general reduction of the assessed value of real property in accordance with present prices. PUBLIC WORKS The so-called pork barrel system, as known in the United States and as sometimes practiced in the Philippines, must definitely be discarded. It is a waste of public funds. I am in favor of continuing the building of roads and schools, in accordance with a carefully-prepared plan to be followed systematically in the or der of their relative importance to the general public. PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 255 I stand by the educational policy enunciated in the Constitution. The principle underlying this policy is the training for useful, well-disciplined, self sacrificing citizenship that draws its breath of life from Filipino patriotism. Our system of education should be revised so as to accomplish that aim still more effectively. The State is in duty bound to maintain a complete and adequate system of public education, providing at least free public primary in struction and citizenship training to adult citizens. My at tention will be especially devoted to making it possible for every child to go to school. Adult citizenship training will be carried out in accordance with a broad and systematic plan. To the end that poverty may not prevent gifted young men and women from developing their talent, the Government should create the largest possible number of scholarships for them in all branches of learning. Our educational objective should fit in with our economic policy. I am for greater emphasis on vocational and agricultural training in the in termediate and high schools, but the in struction should always be in keeping with the economic conditions of each region and of the country as a whole"

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE An in dependent judiciary administering justice with out fear or favor promptly and impartially to rich and poor alike is the strongest bulwark of in dividual rights and the best guaranty against oppression and usurpation from any source. Equally important is the maintenance of the confidence of the people in the courts. I will appoint no man to the bench with out having satisfied myself, after a thorough in vestigation, of his character and ability. To strengthen the faith of the common people in our courts, it is necessary that the utmost care be exerted in the selection of justices of the peace. These courts are of ten the only tribunals accessible to the larger portion of our population and it is essential that they be maintained Worthy of their confidence. If the disinherited cannot obtain redress of their grievances or vindication of their rights in these courts, they have no further recourse, for the Courts of First Instance and the Supreme Court are of ten beyond their reach. By the impartiality and in tegrity of the justices of the peace, the refore, the judiciary of the Philippines is judged by the millions of our countrymen who live in the barrios and distant places. I pledge myself to do everything in my power to maintain these courts free from political or other extraneous in fluence and to appoint the reto only men of proven ability and in tegrity and of the broadest human sympathies. SOCIAL PROBLEMS The welfare of the people should be the concern of the Government. The helpless and the needy, the jobless, as well as the workers in the factories and in the field have a claim upon the Government to safeguard their health and well-being. The contentment of the masses is the first in surance against social and political disorders. It is the duty of the Government to protect the working men against social and political disorders. It is the duty and exploitation to secure to them fair wages and return for their labor. 256 Let us beware of men who deliberately, for political or selfish aims, stir up discontent among the masses. They preach subversive doctrines, speak of evils and abuses that do not exits, or magnify those which of ten are in evitable in democracies. These men are those worse enemies of society, more dangerous to the community than or dinary criminals. They have no sympathy for the people, but are mere self-seekers, in tent only in securing either pecuniary or political advantage for the mselves. If as a result of their preaching disorders occur, they cowardly disclaim all responsibility for that which none other than the mselves had brought about. He who tries to carry favor with the masses by appealing to the passions of the people, stirring up their prejudices, or capitalizing discontent or human suffering, is unworthy of public trust. LANDED ESTATES The ownership of big landed estates by corporations or absentee landlords have in variably caused discontent and unrest among the tenants or occupants of such estates. The discontent among the tenants of the Friar lands contributed to the causes which led to the rebellion against Spain. Those Friar lands have been acquired by the Government and sold in small lots but there are still a few large haciendas particularly in Luzon that are the hotbeds of discontent and unrest among their tenants. Not only for the sake of these tenants, but also in the in terest of peace, every effort should be made to acquire these haciendas, at a fair and just price to be sold in small lots to the tenants. There are complaints in certain places that the tenants are the victims of unfair practices on the part of their landlords. These abuses must be stopped and the tenant protected in his rights. LABOR Fortunately for our country, we have had no sharp cleavages between labor and capital. Strikes have been few and far-between, and they have never been long-drawn-out or general. That we have so far been spared the extremities of class warfare, is no proof that we shall for ever be exempt. Our good for tune should rather teach us to seek the means to preserve the country against such conflicts by the only method which experience has shown to be effective; namely, by taking steps designed to prevent the exploitation and oppression of the working men and thus assure their happiness and contentment. Filipino laborers, compared to those of other or iental countries, receive higher wages and are much better protected in their rights by legislation. We have enacted many laws protecting labor. In all earnestness, however, I must say that we must go further in this direction. The experience of centuries shows that the one sure way to Protect society against class war is to secure to wage- earners their due. I am against communism. I am a firm believer in the in stitution of private property. I contend, however, that whenever property rights come in conflict with human rights, the for mer should yield to the latter. 257 If we would preserve the in stitution of private property, we must hold fast to this principle, in the determination of conflicting rights between man and man. It is thus that we may draw the line between the rights of labor and capital and erect an economic structure based on the Principle that human life is the measure of all other values, that considerations of possession and profit must give way to the supremacy of human existence.

Existing in vestments, whether for eign or national, will receiver every in ducement to stay, and outside capital will be welcomed. We especially desire that new American capital should come and help in the development of the country. NATIONAL DEFENSE I believe in the efficacy of the in strumentalities of peace, such as the League of Nations or treaties of neutrality. In due time we should apply for admission o the League and urge the negotiation of a multilateral treaty for the neutralization of the Philippines. However, we cannot ignore present-day realities. We cannot rely exclusively on these implements of peace for our national defense. I favor preparedness for national defense. We cannot afford to have, nor do I approve of, a large standing army or costly military establishments, but we must have a regular army of sufficient size for our requirements and a trained citizenry ready to be drafted into service in any emergency. For the proper planning of our defenses and or ganization and training of our regular and citizen army I shall secure the best expert advice. OUR RELATIONS WITH AMERICA It should be our constant endeavor to maintain the most friendly relations and closest collaboration with the United States. We owe much to America and we are grateful to her. Our present economy is tied up with the free American market. Many of our in dustries depend for their existence on our reciprocal free trade relations with the United States, and we should try to maintain these trade relations if possible, even after in dependence. I shall spare no effort to obtain the elimination of the export tax provided in the Independence Law. I shall work for the repeal of the excise tax on coconut oil. I shall endeavor to take such action as may be required to place our trade relations with the United States on a truly reciprocal basis, so that they may be continued after in dependence for the mutual advantage of both countries. FOREIGN RELATIONS 258 As already stated, our for eign relations will be under the control and supervision of the United States during the Commonwealth; but there is nothing in the Independence Act which prevents the Commonwealth from beginning to lay the foundations for our future relations with for eign nations. Indeed, the period of transition having been provided t give to the Filipino people time to prepare the mselves for the responsibilities of an in dependent government, it can be rightly assumed that the United States meant to give us the opportunity, under the Commonwealth of in itiating both political as well as trade relations with other countries, subject to its supervision and control. We shall request the State Department at Washington to permit the Commonwealth to send men as at taches to American legations or embassies as well as to American consulates in or der that these men may acquire the knowledge and experience in the diplomatic service and provide our government with needed in for mation concerning for eign trade. It will be necessary and to our advantage besides to win the good-will of, and maintain friendly relations with, other nations. But to accomplish this aim, mere protestations of good purposes are not enough. We must deal fairly with all nations and respect their rights. We must secure to every for eigner who lives with us full protection of our laws. His life, his property, must be as safe among us as they are in his own land. During the transition period we shall endeavor to find new markets for our products so that if and when the market of the United States shall no longer be open to us except on a competitive basis, we may not be left with out outlet for our products. PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE The question of Philippine Independence has been settled. The Independence Law sets the day for in dependence and prescribes the process leading to its consummation. We accepted the Independence Law, we have approved a Constitution pursuant to its provisions, and the people by ratifying it with practical unanimity have agree to the grant of in dependence under the terms and conditions prescribed by the Congress. Independence, the refore, is no longer an issue either in the United States or in the Philippines. Insofar as the terms and conditions of in dependence are concerned, we made it plain when we accepted the Independence Law that we reserved the right to petition Congress for their modification with a view to making them less burdensome for our people and more adapted to the at tainment of the purpose for which Congress in tended them. We consider the economic provisions of the Independence Law not entirely fair to the Philippines. We regard legislation recently passed by Congress imposing greater restrictions on our free imports to the United States or authorizing the collection of exorbitant taxes on some of our products sold in that country, not only discriminatory, but a virtual violation of the solemn covenant between the two countries We shall exert every effort to secure the repeal of hose discriminatory measures and to obtain amendments to the Independence Law looking to a more equitable trade arrangement between the United States and the Philippines during the Commonwealth"

It was, the refore, chiefly for the benefit of the Philippines, rather than of the United States that the in termediate period of ten years was fixed. While there may be differences of opinion as to whether this period is too long or too short all must agree that if our trade relations with the United States during the Commonwealth should prove more in jurious to our country than they would under complete in dependence, the Philippines would then do well to hasten the date of separation from America. This fact will not be revealed to us until after the first years of the Commonwealth and we have known the result of the economic conference between representatives of the United States and the Philippines which, I trust, will be called by the President of the United States at an early date. Meanwhile, I consider it a most disturbing in fluence which will retard our work of economic readjustment and reconstruction, for anyone to advocate now the shortening of the transition period. What the country direly needs to-day is a period of stability and business confidence so that we may proceed unhampered in the task of erecting our new Government and building up the national economy to in crease the wealth of the nation, promote commerce, agriculture, and in dustry; improve the condition of our wage-earners, and create economic opportunities for all our citizens. We need to give capital reasonable certainty as to those conditions which affect in vestment; we need to assure the in dustries that are dependent upon the free American market that no radical changes will take place which will bring about a sudden loss of the market on which they depend; we need above all to provide economic security for the masses of our people which can only be accomplished through the maintenance of stable business conditions. I yield to no one in my fervent desire to see the Philip-pines in dependent as soon as possible, but I cannot close my eyes to the fact that a difference of a few years may mean a great deal to the well-being of our people and the permanence of our national liberty. Besides, we should not be deluded into believing that it is possible for anyone at this time to obtain from Congress the shortening of the transition period. All the pleas that may now be submitted in support of this action had already been considered and passed upon by that body. No new reason can be advanced that had not been already submitted. Therefore, making an issue of the shortening of the transition period is unfair to our people and most in jurious to their in terests. I am anxious to see our in dependence established at the earliest possible date. I look upon it as the most precious reward for the many years of ceaseless efforts that I have spent in its quest. I pledge myself anew resolutely to take all necessary steps leading to the advent of in dependence, and to do everything in my power to make the Philippine Republic strong and enduring, and the blessings of liberty not only the cherished possession of this generation but the priceless heritage of the Filipino people for all the time. 260 “Commonwealth Act No. 1 An Act to Provide for the National Defense of the Philippines, Penalizing Certain Violations Thereof, Appropriating Funds Therefor, And for Other Purposes” Accessed December 4, 2020.

High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands. 1936. Annual Report of the United States High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands Commissioner to the Philippine Islands Covering the Calendar Year 1935-1936. Washington: U. S. G. P. O. Accessed December 4, 2010. Source: https://catalog. hathitrust. org/Record/100145145/Home By the Commonwealth period, the highest position held by an American of ficial in the Philippines is the High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands. This is an excerpt from the annual report sent by Frank Murphy, the first High Commissioner, to the United States government. The excerpt below shows a reporting of the Sakdal demonstration in Manila on October 3, 1936. The Manila demonstration was part of the series of activities of the Sakdal Party. Founded by Benigno Ramos in 1930, the Sakdal Party was a populist movement that advocated for Philippine nationalism and in dependence and agrarian socialism. Most of their activity revolved in Central Luzon such as the provinces of Laguna, Rizal, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Pampanga. Excerpt: VI. PUBLIC ORDER 26. Two minor disturbances.—Public or der was good during the period under report, except for two minor disturbances. The first of these was an outbreak of brigandage in the mountains of Laguna, which began a short time before the end of the for mer regime. The Commonwealth President went to Laguna soon after his in auguration and gave this matter his personal at tention to such effect that the outbreak was suppressed in a very short time. A terroristic demonstration in the city of Manila on the evening of October 3, 1936, was the subject of an in quiry from the Bureau of Insular Affairs. This in quiry and the reply by the Acting High Commissioner were as follows: [Extra priority radio no. 740] 267 WASHINGTON, October 21, 1936. UNITED STATES HIGH COMMISSIONER, Manila: Press dispatches of 19 th in stant report terrorist plots to create disturbances through assassinations, bombings, etc. Please radio brief summary of the facts as developed to date. COX. [Extra priority radio] OCTOBER 22, 1936. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington (Cox): Reference your no. 740 October 21, an outbreak occurred October 3 shortly after 8 o'clock p. m. in the city of Manila. Four explosions were heard, eight fires started, and there were four at tempts at arson, all within a period of 3 hours. Parsons Hardware near the Ayala Bridge and nearby buildings were damaged to the extent of 1,000,000 pesos. One water main in Santa Mesa was broken by explosives, shutting off the water supply to a large section of Manila for several hours. Theodoro Navarro and Lorenzo Galang, said to be leaders of Sakdals, were arrested October 5. They denied having participated in the acts of October 3, but news stories later in dicated they were in volved in confessions reported in the press October 20. Many of the news stories are vague and give the impression of reportorial guesswork. Since October 3 police have found bombs in several Manila buildings and seven bombs were reported found upon the arrest of five members of Sakdal party at Malabon October 18. Newspaper of October 20 carried stories that “Sakdal terror plot spreading.” These stories followed the arrest of the five Sakdal leaders ment ioned above. Confessions as reported by the press were to the effect that Sakdals planned to set fire Manila on the night of October 3 and then sweep the five nearby Provinces and take control of municipal and provincial governments. According to press reports leaders stated in confessions that they lost their nerve when they entered Manila and heard the explosions on night of October 3. 268 Philippine Army of ficials report that there is no truth in the statement that a plot was unearthed to assassinate Government of ficials in cluding the Archbishop and the High Commissioner, but rather that the persons questioned denied there was any such plot. They report that no communications have been received by local Sakdalistas from Ramos for about 1 year and there is no or ganized opposition to any activities of the Government; that such acts of terrorism that have occurred have been sporadic and not a part of a general plan; that the present unrest is confined to the city of Manila and the provinces of Rizal, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Pampanga, and that there is peace and or der in all other parts of the Philippines in cluding Laguna, Cavite, and Batangas Provinces. The reports received to day in dicate a plan for an uprising in the vicinity of Manila on November 1. The general public seems very little disturbed. United States Army of ficials, Philippine Army of ficials, and police of ficials are alert but not apprehensive. They believe that disorders are local in character, poorly led, poorly financed. and loosely or ganized. They report that labor groups in Manila are restive because of the failure of wages to be advanced in the face of advances in prices of commodities and more prosperous times among manufacturing, shipping, and commercial in terests"

The recent typhoons did considerable damage to the rice crop which has caused suffering in Central Luzon and the Cagayan Walley. This suffering, according to reports, was quite acute but is being rapidly alleviated. Tenant farmers are complaining because landlords have in sisted upon advance payments of cash rent when customarily they have been content to receive rents on in stallments. Dissatisfaction with authorities is at tributed by some as a protest against announcement by President Quezon that on account of present unrest he did not in tend to release political prisoners on November 15 as previously announced. Others believe that the Government is magnifying reports of violence as justification for building up the Philippine Army. Philippine Army of ficials however deplore the publicity given to reports of disorders as they say that such reports are frequently erroneous and nearly always exaggerated. Bulletin this morning has eight-column headline, “Fear New Sakdal Outbreak”, this being based on a rumor that “a big haul of rifles and ammunition was smuggled into one of the coast to wns of the Philippines.” The Bulletin story goes on to say “the tense situation is further aggravated by the flight of the Sakdal leaders to the mountains, the reported burial of all \"red\" documents and the seething unrest among the radical followers of the political prisoners who lost their chances of early freedom when President Quezon decided not to give them amnesty.” The Philippine Army of ficials state that there is no truth in the statement that rifles and ammunition were smuggled into one of the coast to wns nor has there been a flight of Sakdal leaders to the mountains. There are very few political prisoners as Governor Murphy pardoned the majority of all those convicted for participating in the disorders of May 1935 and since that time President Quezon has pardoned a number. I believe there is no cause for apprehension here. The Government is in strong hands and I believe the Philippine authorities are doing everything in their power to relieve the suffering and to improve the lot of the poor and unemployed. President Quezon is in very close to uch with the situation and with all classes of people. He has visited devastated areas and has come in contact first hand with the sufferers. The 269 Assembly has just appropriated $ 1,500,000 to relieve the situation. United States Army and Navy authorities see no reason to be alarmed. My weekly reports sent by air mail to High Commissioner Murphy give all details as I get them from press and from other sources. This radio is based upon reports received from military authorities of the United States Army, naval authorities, and Philippine Army authorities, in quiries made from numerous in dividuals and reports in the press and personal observation of myself and staff JONES 270 Letter of President Quezon on Three-point Policy for Mindanao and Sulu, October 08, 1937 This document was crafted by Jorge Vargas, and serves as a reply of President Quezon to a letter sent by Sultan Ombra Amilbangsa, an assemblyman representing Sulu. Amilbangsa sent a letter expressing his concerns over the policies defining the Commonwealth government’s administration over Mindanao and Sulu. Jorge Vargas (1890-1980) was a lawyer and diplomat, who served in Quezon’s cabinet as the executive secretary from 1936 to 1941. Later on, he became the secretary of national defense in 1941. Ambilbagsa agreed with the policy to give a broader power to the Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu as overseer of administrative affairs, However, he laments the nonrecognition of the various existent titles across different areas in Mindanao, asks for consultation on the appointment of army of ficers as governors in the Moro provinces, and concludes with identifying himself as belonging to group of the supporters of his administration not as passive yielders but as engaging allies of fering constructive criticisms and suggestion to policy and programs. Letter of President Quezon on Three-point Policy for Mindanao and Sulu, October 8, 1937 Letter* of His Excellency Manuel L.

In this connection permit me to call your at tention to the fact that in his memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior dated September 20, 1937, His Excellency does not seek to in terfere with the use of titles by Moro sultans or datus so long as it is clearly understood that a title carries with it no of ficial rights or privileges. What the President desires to emphasize is that there are no privileged classes under this Government and no authority vested on any 271 in dividual not occupying an of ficial position. In other words, the President is determined to consider and to act to wards the Mohammedan Filipinos as he considers and acts to wards the Christians, precisely because he agrees with you that the so-called Moro problem is a myth.

Very respectfully, Jorge B. Vargas Secretary to the President Hon. Ombra Amilbangsa National Assembly Manila * This is a reply to a letter of Assemblyman Ombra Amilbangsa, which is as follows: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MANILA October 2, 1937 His Excellency The PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES Malacañan Palace Manila Dear Mr. President: 1. In recent issues of the local dailies, I read with deep in terest the released copy of Your Excellency’s Memorandum, addressed to the Honorable, the Secretary of the Interior, in which Your Excellency’s “Three-Point Policies,” defining how affairs in Moroland are to be 272 administered, was embodied. As Your Excellency’s loyal supporter, I cannot let the news pass with out commenting on the policies, especially in their relations to my district. 2. The policy of giving a free hand to the Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu on all plans he may deem fit to execute is in deed plausible and commendable, and it could not have been otherwise. As a matter of fact, I joined Assemblymen Fortich and Cabili in endorsing that policy to Your Excellency when the measure was yet pending the action of the National Assembly. 3. As to the non-recognition of the various titles, a practice still adhered to by the various Mohammedan elements in Mindanao and Sulu, I think, Mr. President, the policy as released covering this subject was most unnecessary, as the non-recognition has already taken effect since the abrogation of the Bates Treaty and the implantation of the Civil Government in the regions referred to. In the agreement concluded between the Sultan of Sulu and Frank Carpenter, then Secretary of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, the for mer is recognized as a temporal head of that region and as such his of fice is confined to religious activities. In the light of these facts the Government, I think, Mr. President, has no right to in terfere with them so long as no law or or der is in fringed. The religious titles ever since in vogue in the Mohammedan regions are akin to religious titles enjoyed and practiced by the different Christian sects. 4. The policy of suppressing the practice of appointing army of ficers as governors in Moro provinces is one thing about which I beg to be allowed to discuss at length and with liberty. The administration dating back to the early American administrators, had in itiated various policies principally in tended to maintain peace and or der, but lamentably never promulgated policies to effect universal improvements in those regions. As a result of this uncomprehensive plan, the accomplishments were nothing more than the blowing out of the Moro cottas and enactment of other bloody dramas. Judging from the records of the past, it seems that questions of efficiency of administration in Moroland depend in a large measure, upon the personal ability, in tegrity and far-sightedness of the local administrator rather than by imposing rigid obedience to mutable policies. 5. Regarding the present in cumbent, Major Leon Angeles, his administration since his appointment is one worthy of praise and commendation. His experience and adeptness in understanding conditions obtaining in the province, make him the most logical man to remain in the position for sometime until Your Excellency think otherwise. He is the most capable Filipino governor ever appointed to that position. I believe that in justice to the in cumbent, Your Excellency should allow him to remain for sometime in or der that he could accomplish the projects he has just started. 6. Talks of Moro problems, both of the past and the present, have been the to pics deafening the ears of the public. The Moros, myself in cluded, are ignorant of the so-called Moro problems, and we emphatically deny its existence. 273 7. In passing, I beg leave to state that in Mindanao Your Excellency has two groups of supporters: the first are those who readily yield assent to what Your Excellency say, and the second, those who study Your Excellency’s policy and of fer constructive criticisms and suggestions to the end that the country may be benefited. I am happy that I belong to the second group so that if I express myself openly and frankly, it is because it is my honest and sincere belief that in doing so, I am helping and coöperating with Your Excellency to perfect a policy conducive to the general welfare of my people. Respectfully yours, (Sgd.)

The referendum will determine whether or not the Filipino woman shall exercise the right of suffrage. Considering the large number of registrants, the support of in fluential men led by the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, and the earnestness of women leaders, the coming referendum promises to turn in favor of the suffragists. We ardently hope that more than half a million women registrants will vote favorably on the question on April 30. Let no task on that day, women of the Philippines, deter you from going to the nearest precinct to cast your affirmative vote. To discharge this duty will require only a few minutes of your time, yet you will be taking away in a momentous event, unique in the history of our country. By referring to the Filipino women the question of suffrage, which affects not only the mselves but the entire nation, is in itself an unequivocal admission on the part of the framers of our constitution of their confidence in the ability of Filipino woman to decide a national question. True to the Filipino tradition, our women would not impose a right and responsibility upon the women unless women the mselves desire it. They have the refore given us the privilege of expressing our wishes on the subject. Women of the Philippines, if you participate in the coming referendum your name shall be written in delibly on the pages of our history, and your descendants will be proud of you and call you emancipators of the women of your country. 275 Once you become an elector, you shall at tain the same political status as the men. You can help directly elect to public of fice a worthy candidate; you can help defeat a dishonest and in capable aspirant. In a democratic country, the ballot is the most effective in strument in the hands of the average man. Without it the average man is a for gotten man; but with it, the average man becomes the most powerful man in the country. Government of ficials listen at tentively to his pleas or complaints, knowing that he is a voter, whose vote on election day must be reckoned with. To the average man the ballot is an in surance against oppression and in justice; and let this be borne in mind by our women who will soon be enfranchised. As women voters, we can wield a salutary in fluence on politics if we use our power to combat corruption, in justice, and oppression. Let us be judicious in the use of our newly acquired right, aware of the responsibility that goes with it. We are familiar with the electoral abuses which had been committed in the past. They were a blot on our political life. As voters we can help the recurrence of such evils by refusing to be a party in an unlawful scheme or vigorously denouncing any flagrant defiance of the election law. Let none of us be guilty of giving our right to vote for a paltry consideration. We must use it to bring the utmost good to society as whole. The system of voting used in our country is the Australian ballot or the secret method of voting. It assures every voter absolute secrecy and liberty in voting. Through this system he can vote as he desires and he need not fear the political bosses of his locality. After the grant of woman suffrage, our next campaign should be directed to making our women in telligent and vigilant citizens. This task will devolve upon the thousands of educated women scattered all over the Islands. It will be their duty to enlighten the mass of women of low educational at tainment whose knowledge about their new right is vague or confused. 276 Topic 8: World War II List of Reading Materials: 1. 1943 Constitution 2.

However, the bombing continued resulting in the destruction of Manila. Shortly after the occupation of Manila, the Japanese for ces established their government in the country that lasted until 1945. This section in cludes pertinent documents related to World War II in the Philippines such as the 1943 Constitution, memoirs of political personalities like Jose P. Laurel and Claro M. Recto and selected articles discussing different the mes like public safety, health, education and public in struction. These references are in valuable source of in for mation about the life and struggles of Filipinos during the Japanese occupation. 278 The 1943 Constitution At the outset of the occupation, the Japanese government for med the Philippine Executive Commission which was composed mainly of political leaders of the Commonwealth government. They also or ganized the KALIBAPI ( Kapisanan ng Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas), the only political or ganization allowed in the country at that time. On June 16, 1943, Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo promised to grant Philippines its in dependence. The KALIBAPI then for med the Preparatory Committee on Philippine Independence (PCPI) which was tasked to draft a new Constitution for the Philippines. The PCPI approved the new Constitution on September 4, 1943 and was ratified by the KALIBAPI Convention on September 7, 1943. The 1943 Constitution adopted 12 of the Articles from the 1935 Constitution with a powerful executive branch vested in the President who is to be elected by a majority of the members of the National Assembly. One notable characteristic of the 1943 Constitution is the absence of the Bill of Rights.

Laurel. (September 15 - November 16, 1945) Manila: Laurel Foundation. pp. 1-21. Jose P. Laurel is known for his distinguished career as a supreme court justice and as a politician. In 1925, he was elected to the Philippine Senate and would serve for one term before losing his re-election bid to Claro M. Recto. In 1934, he was again elected as delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention where he headed the committee on the Bill of Rights. He was the Secretary of Justice when Japan at tacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. In 1943, he assumed Presidency under the Japanese-sponsored in dependence. After Japan's surrender in 1945, Laurel was arrested and was charged of treason but never tried due to an amnesty. This memoir was written while in Sugamo Prison in the outskirts of Tokyo, from September 15, 1945 to November 16, 1945. Because the Americans did not allow Laurel to have a writing paper, the memoirs were written across a book, The World in 2030 A. D. by the Earl of Birkenhead. This was published by the Jose P. Laurel Memorial Foundation which was founded after his death on November 6, 1959. Excerpt MEMORANDUM I Before the outbreak of the Pacific War I was Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines — was successful law-practitioner and recommended for appointment to the Supreme Bench by the Filipino and the American Bar Associations (1935-36). Was appointed in the month of February, 1936.' II When the Philippine Army was federalized and the Pacific War seemed imminent, I wrote a letter to Marshal Mac Arthur, then also military adviser to the Commonwealth Government, of fering my services. He sent me a personal letter appreciating. I thought I could be useful in the Judge Advocate Department. III 282 Around September or October of 1941 President Quezon in vited me to breakfast and requested me to be his Secretary of Justice. My first reaction was against it. I was thru with politics and I wanted to make a name in the juridical field and bring about the codification and in tegration of all our laws. I had already succeeded in the creation of a Code Committee of which Don Ramon Avancena was Chairman and I was a member. But I was prevailed upon and thus I became a member of the President’s War Cabinet. IV After my in duction into of fice ( Secretary of Justice) I at tended the meetings of the War Cabinet in the country Manila, March 9, 1962 house of the Quezon’s under the shade of a big mango tree just a few feet up from an air-raid shelter. (See photo, opposite page —) I prepared (with for mer Speaker Roxas —then Lieut.-Col. and aide to Gen. Mac Arthur—and for mer Secretary Jose Abad Santos who had just been appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) two radio speeches for President Quezon. The last speech was made in side the air-raid shelter in the presence of U. S. Naval of ficers, Chief Justice Santos, Secretary Vargas, Mrs. Quezon and children and myself. I think J. E. H. Stevenot and another American in charge of the radio connection were also present. V The Cabinet of Pres. Quezon met every day, frequently twice a day — morning and afternoon — up to the time I personally accompanied Pres. Quezon and family to the Presidential landing at the Luneta — from Malacanan bound for Corregidor. President Quezon was terribly nervous and as I shook hands with Doha Aurora she said to me, with copious tears from her eyes — \"May God Bless all of you.\" VI It was in one of those hectic days of December (1941) that Gen. Mac Arthur, accompanied by Lieut-Col. Roxas (in full uniform with overseas cap), arrived at Marikina either while the war cabinet was in session, or I was there because I had an important of ficial business to transact with the President. It was the anniversary of the marriage of President and Mrs. Quezon. I do not remember the exact date. Pres. Quezon and Gen. Mac Arthur embraced each other and a picture was taken in which I appear with Secretary Vargas and Lt. Col. Boxes (See photo opposite page —) VII. I recall that the call of Gen. Mac Arthur on President Quezon and the radio speech made by him — ment ioned in the preceding paragraph, IV — took place after December 8,1941 when Baguio and other places of the Philippines were bombed by the Japanese. President Quezon was in Baguio when this city was bombed on that date VIII. 283 The daily or frequent meetings of the members of the Cabinet present in Manila continued (some prominent public of ficials at this time had evacuated Manila) until President Quezon was advised—according to him by Gen. Mac Arthur — that he might move to Corregidor. The reaction of the President was against it. He believed that the step might be in terpreted as abandonment by him of his people. He dictated a letter addressed to Gen. Mac Arthur refusing to go. I went over this draft which he read at the meeting of his war cabinet in the afternoon of the same day or the following day. The following were present (if memory does not fail me) Vice- President Osmena, Chief Justice Santos, Sec. Vargas, Gen. Valdes, Gen. Francisco, Sec. Guinto and others. At this gathering, President Quezon looked sad but not broken in spirit. He moved from his seat and transferred to my right side, placing himself between Gen. Guillermo B"

Francisco and me, and said to me: \"What do you think, Secretary? I do not want to go to Corregidor because our people will think I am abandoning them.\" I replied: \"I don't think so; they will understand,\" and he moved back to his for mer seat to hear the observation of the people present. The suggestion of all those present — except General Francisco—was that the President had better go. It was felt that the capture of the President would mean the overthrow of the Commonwealth Government and that the suggestion came after a deliberate decision of Washington. Secretary Guinto moved that the members of the Cabinet accompany the President to Corregidor. To this, President Quezon replied that there was not enough space in the island for tress for so many people, and that if he were to go, he should—according to the advice of Gen. Mac Arthur — pick the people who were to accompany him. He then observed that he would like to have Vice-President Osmena with him because in case anything should happen, Mr. Osmena could take his place, General Valdes, who was then the Secretary of National Defense and a physician-surgeon, Manoling (Manuel Roxas) who after all was already aide to Gen. Mac Arthur and one or two more members to give hint technical assistance. After adjournment of the meeting, Pres. Quezon said: \"Laurel, please wait, I would like to see you.\" I waited and then followed him to the principal building (coming from the place of meeting behind, under the mango tree). Once in the small reception room where there was a Japanese painting of or chids (I say Japanese because of combination of strong colors peculiar to Japanese painters), first story or floor of the house, the President placed his arm around my waist and said: \"Laurel, I would like you to go with me to Corregidor to help me prepare papers and documents there; are you in a position to come?\" My reply was: \"Yes, Mr. President, if you need me.\" \"Then,\" he said \"get ready, we may leave any moment\" And I departed and went to my room in the Executive Building (Malacanan Palace) where I was in stalled as Secretary of Justice and legal adviser to the President According to my recollection, all this occurred on December 22, 1941. After transacting business in my of fice I went home, started to prepare my belongings, placing them in a suitcase. My wife was sick; she had cardiac ailment and my plan was to tell her on the eleventh hour and bid her and the children good-bye. IX. The following day, Dee. 23, 1941, another meeting of the Cabinet was held in the same place under the mango tree in Marikina. President Quezon and Vice-President °ameba were present. I believe that Manuel Boxes was also present and members of the Cabinet and other important of ficials of the Government. It was at this meeting that he announced finally those who were to 284 go with him; that he would take along Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos, appoint me Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at the same time, and leave me in Manila \"to help Mr. Vargas\" who became the Mayor of Greater Manila (words in quotation were President Quezon's). It was at this juncture that I raised the very important question pertaining to the conduct and behavior of those of us he was leaving behind; I said: \"Mr. President, it is easy to say that you are leaving us to take care of the situation with a view to the protection of our civil population considering the fact that when the Japanese for ces come we shall be performing neutral functions pertaining to municipal administration and the administration of justice; but the Japanese may require or compel us to do many things which are in imical to our Government or that of the United States. In my case, may I leave my position and go to the mountains. I am asking this question, because when you come back you might disapprove of our acts and accuse us of disloyalty. We would hate to be placed in that predicament.\" \"George,\" said President Quezon in a loud voice; (calling for Secretary Vargas) \"Secretary Laurel is raising a very important question here\"—he restated it —\"will you call up Gen. Mac Arthur and find out if I could talk to him?\" I do not know whether Pres. Quezon was able to take up this matter with the General but he (Quezon) told me before his departure for Corregidor in the provisional air-raid shelter below the ballroom of Malacanan (with Chief Justice Abad Santos, Gen. Francisco and Secretary Vargas) that he (Quezon) had talked to Gen. Mac Arthur who told him (Quezon): \"What can you do under the circumstances? You have to do what they ask you to do except one thing—the taking of any oath of allegiance to Japan.\" In the various conversations that I had with Mr. Vargas—the last during our confinement at the Yokohama Prison—he in for med me that he himself had submitted the question to Gen. Mac Arthur upon in struction of President Quezon, and that Gen. Mac Arthur's reply was transmitted to me by President Quezon. I must say that Vice-Pres. Clemens and other members of the Cabinet and others were present when I raised the question; and I reported the in cident to Don Ramon Avancena and the Justices of the Supreme Court at the time.

In this connection (vide paragraph V. supra). XI. Before departure or already in Corregidor, President Quezon reorganized and simplified the Government setup but I was left as Secretary of Justice and at the same time Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,\" with definite in struction to stay or remain in Manila \"to help Mr. Vargas\" in protecting the civilian population, bearing in mind the line of action embodied in the reply of Gen. Mac Arthur as transmitted to me by Pres. Quezon (See paragraph IX, above) and later confirmed by Mr. Jorge B. Vargas. XII 285 Since then (Dec. 24) I never had occasion or opportunity to contact Pres. Quezon or any of his companions. Mr. Vargas, I understand, was able to communicate with Pres. Quezon before the entry of the Japanese for ces into Manila which took place on January 2, 1942. XII After the departure of Pres. Quezon, Mr. Vargas, who was then the Mayor of Greater Manila, became the head and representative of the Commonwealth Government with me helping him. I was all the time practically with him in Malacanan and, when necessary, we transacted business by telephone. XIV On December 31, 1941, we were in for med that the advance unit of the Japanese for ces were near Manila. Mr. Vargas called me to his of fice in Malacanan and told me that the plan was for a representative of the Commonwealth Government to go with the Japanese Consul-General, Jitaro Kihara, and meet the Zones coming from the south. Because of certain difficulties, I was not able to go but Consul Kihara, accompanied by his assistant (Mr. Okazaki) and General Arsenio Natividad went as far as the town of Began, Laguna, where they contacted the first contingent of the Japanese in vading for ces. They used a Cadillac-7 passenger or (also chauffeur) No. 6, that I was using then as Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. XV There was confusion, excitement and general consternation when the Japanese unit entered Manila in the afternoon of Jan. 2, 1942. Before this date, Manila and Cavite were bombed with many casualties. Sto. Domingo Church, Intendencia Building, the Philippine Herald Building and other important buildings in Intramuros were destroyed; the Cavite Naval area was razed to the ground; looting was rampant all over Manila; the Manila Police had to be disarmed; wild rumors were circulated — these. and more contributed to the deplorable state of moral collapse of the people of Manila at the time of the occupation of that city by the Imperial Japanese for ces. XVI Among the first high ranking of ficials of the Japanese Army that entered Manila were Lt.- Col. Maeda and Maj. Gen. Hayashi. The name of the Commander-in-chief was kept secret, although somehow it was known that he was Gen. Homma. Gen. Maeda, who was the Chief of Staff, occupied the Manila Hotel. I think Gen. Hayashi went to the Army and Navy Club building. Around the 4 th or 5 th of that month of January (1942) several Japanese residents of importance in the Philippines began to contact prominent Filipinos in Manila. Mr. Imamura in troduced Mr. Vargas to Gen. Maeda and Mr. Kanegae accompanied Messrs. Aquino, Recto and Alunan. I think that Mr. Paredes and I were also in troduced to General Maeda but at different dates. There might have been other people who had seen Gen. Maeda. Later Consul Kihara and Mr. Morokuma arrived from Japan and contacted Vargas and the other Filipinos 286 who saw Gen. Maeda. They were told for thwith to or ganize the mselves into what was called \"central administration or gan,\" ostensibly for the maintenance of peace and or der and as in strumentality of the consequent military occupation of certain places by the Japanese for ces. XVII As the or der of Gen. Maeda was imperative and urgent, Mr. Vargas, who was our representative and spokesman, suggested that a meeting be held at the call of for mer Speaker Yulo who at the time was President of the Nacionalista Party, the ruling party of President Manuel L. Quezon. This was done and for almost two weeks we met in the house of Speaker Yulo at Peñafrancia. In the beginning few were able to at tend. Stenographic notes of the proceedings were taken but according to Mr. Yulo they were destroyed for fear of the Japanese. The reply to the directive of Gen. Maeda, addressed to Mr. Vargas asking us among other things to or ganize and to entirely cut or sever our connections with the Americans was the subject of a prolonged discussion. A temporary political expedient was the continuation of the Commonwealth Government and its of ficials. This was rejected, however. by Gen. Maeda on the ground that the Commonwealth was a creation of the United States and fought the Imperial Japanese Forces. After repeated conferences of Mr. Vargas (who, as observed, was the spokesman) and Gen. Maeda we were definitely told to or ganize an entirety new setup.

XVIII The high command of the Javanese Army later selected the people who wore to become members of what was known as the Executive Commission (Ad. Order No. 1, Jan. 23,1943, addressed to Jorge Vargas).' Mr. Jorge B. Vargas became chairman, Benigno Aquino, Commissioner of the Interior. Antonio de las Alas, Commissioner of Finance, Jose P.

Commissioner of Public Works and Communications, and Teafilo Sison, Auditor General and Director of the Budget. I pleaded to Mr. Vargas that I be retained in the Supreme Court, but he said that could not be done because the High Command of the Japanese Army had already decided. I for got to state that Mr. Jute Yulo became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in this setup. I think that the Executive 287 Commissions was for mally or ganized Jan. 23, 1942, although we received our appointments as commissioners several days later. XIX In my capacity as Commissioner of Justice. I endeavored to retain everybody and to leave the or ganization undisturbed. But the military people began to in terfere, to submit appointments and actions for approval; I was surrounded by a group of military advisers who were utterly in competent and unfamiliar with the progress and development of juridical science in other parts of the work' and it soon became unbearable. Members of the Kempeitai (military police) would appear before courts and judges and ask for the dismissal of cases which were actually being tried. In one case, Judge Cervasio Diaz, of the Court of First Instance of Manila had to abide by the desire of the military people on account of fear. In another case, a fiscal of the City of Manila in the course of an in vestigation of a criminal case had to run away and hide under a table when an agent or of ficer of the military, accompanied by a Japanese in terpreter who was apparently in terested in the case, began slapping everybody in the mom. Other in cidents occurred; and, in the prey-nee, it was worse. To give at least a semblance of regularity to the administration of Justice I issued a circular prohibiting dismissal of raw pending trial or in vestigation except in due course of legal procedure. For this circular. I was asked to report to Fort Santiago and detained for three hours and asked to repeal the circular. Mr. Emilio Abello who was my brilliant assistant commissioner is in a position to give the necessary in for mation pertaining to the administration of justice during this time. XX Each commissioner must have had his bitter experience this time. Mr. Vargas is in a better position to give an account of what had transpired during this period, he being the chairman of the Council of State and of the Executive Commission. The of ficial acts of the Executive Commission are a matter of record. The government was reorganized, administrative or ders issued by the Chairman of the Executive Commission on matters covering an extensive field, in cluding city, provincial and municipal administration. What the Japanese military authorities wanted had to be done. Consul Kihara received the military or ders and in structions for Mr. Vargas. We were made to send cables to President Roosevelt and President Quezon and a manifesto to the fighting Filipinos in Bataan and Corregidor. To save ourselves and avoid retaliatory measures from the Japanese, all these things had to be done. The cruelties in dealing with Filipinos since Japanese occupation and the very idea of \"Fort Santiago\" had stricken terror in the hearts of the Filipinos. We protested and demonstrated, but to no avail; they did what they warned. Perhaps the only consoling feature was our in tervention in behalf of war prisoners. We were allowed to tile a petition for their release (after many had perished); we were able to in tercede in behalf of Gen. Manuel Roxas who was a prisoner of war in Mindanao (I talked personally to Gen. Homma-- in behalf of Gen. Roxas and Chief Justice Abad Santos but the latter seemed to have been executed already). Aquino and I also talked to Gen. Hayashi in 288 behalf of these two Filipinos. We tried to help the prisoners of war by giving them what we could in the midst of antipathy of the Japanese. I had in the Department of Justice Gen. Alberto Ramos, Col. Poblete and Col. Sevilla and others, and in the Department of the Interior a special section was or ganized to give these ex-prisoners of war temporary employment or relief. They had to live: and there was nothing left undone in this direction. The same efforts were made in Malacanan and in all the departments. bureaus and of fices of the Government XXI Much more perhaps could be said of the Executive Commission but reference to the of ficial records becomes necessary. The Executive Commission covers a period from Jan. 23, 1942 to October 14, 1943—about 1 year and 8 months announced that the policy with respect to the Philippines was to give her in dependence as early as possible upon tangible evidence of collaboration with Japan in the establishment of the Co-prosperity sphere. This policy was reiterated by him in a subsequent pronouncement and re-affirmed on the occasion of his first of ficial visit to the Philippines.

This policy was reiterated by him in a subsequent pronouncement and re-affirmed on the occasion of his first of ficial visit to the Philippines. There was some kind of excitement but no spontaneous or genuine rejoicing on the part of the people in general There was doubt as to what kind of in dependence it was going to be. The association with the Japanese was full of misgivings; the general impression being that the political education of the Japanese was in ferior to the Filipinos and that their methods were feudal, cruel and in human. The more in telligent group recalled the experiences of peoples of China, Manchukuo. Korea and Formosa. On the other hand, the star being still in progress, it was felt that the granting of in dependence was not opportune. General Roxas and I discussed this point and we coincided in the expression of this view and of the precarious character of in dependence once obtained. He and separately transmitted this view to Gen. Wachi. the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in the Philippine. We became convinced that the granting of in dependence to the Philippines seas part of the general plan of Japanese political propaganda \"to emancipate the peoples of Greater East Asia\" and could not be deterred; some Filipinos expressed the opinion that-refusal to accept the of fer of political in dependence would place the Filipinos in an awkward position many, on the other hand, said that any change from the 'military administration would be an advantage to our people; and all agreed that after all, in the end, the United States would understand the predicament in which the Filipinas (mind the mselves. XXII As early as January 21, 1941 December, 1942 the Kalibapi (Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas) was or ganized by the Executive Order of the Chairman of the Executive Commission at the in stance of the military authorities (the idea was. I think Gen. Wachi’s) patterned after the Yoko Sankai of Japan and the Concordia of Manchukuo. The fundamental idea behind it was the abolition of all political parties and the in tegration of all the Filipinos for purposes of an effective to talitarian government and the realization of the ideals expressed in the or der. The Chairman of the Executive Commission was made the President and Mr. Benigno Aquino, then Commissioner of the Interior, made the Vice-President and Director- 289 General of the Organization. The military authorities of fered all facilities, in cluding financial, and a separate central of fice established in Manila with ramifications in the provinces and municipalities which were under Japanese control. Because of the transfer of Mr. Aquino to the Kalibapi I was moved from the Department of Justice and became the Commissioner of the Interior.' I requested Chairman Vargas to keep me in the Department of Justice but he told me that my transfer had been decided upon by the high command of the Japanese Army. XXIV Peace conditions were very bad; when I assumed of fice Gen. Jose de Ion Reyes was at the head of the Constabulary or ganized and \"rejuvenated\" by the Japanese military authorities; several constabulary academies were established by said authorities; and many Filipino war prisoners were made to enter these academies. Many of them entered because they had to live and had no other means of survival. Gen. Francisco, Col. Arsenio Natividad and Col. Alberto Ramos were later made director and assistant directors, respectively, of the or ganization. The provinces and municipalities being under my administrative supervision as well as the Constabulary, I was placed by Chairman Vargas at the head of the pacification campaign and each commissioner was assigned a district This pacification campaign was not only a requirement of the Japanese military administration but the only alternative, in the opinion of the members of the Executive Commission, if something had to be dune to minimize the killing, among other things, of so many people. The Japanese, true to their announcement, (soon after the cremation of Mania} for every Japanese killed, wiped out men, women and children and even the in habitants of an entire barrio. The Filipinos, on the other hand, were killing each ocher. Many styled the mselves as \"mien: Three\" when in reality they were not, and had no political ideology whatsoever. Many of them robbed or killed to rob. Gen. Roxas told me that the idea of Gen. Mac Arthur was for the guerillas to \"lie low\" until the opportune time and that this had reference to genuine guerillas and not to i groups devoted to rapine and banditry. This must be the case if the Filipinos were to have any chance of survival Hence in our pacification campaign in Davao`, General Francisco who accompanied the party. and Major Batongmalaque who was the senior in spector of Constabulary in Davao, were in contact with guerilla leaders who assumed the obligation to protect the people outside the cities and to wns.

It was in this division that we were able to take care of many released prisoners. of war. Upon arrival from Mindanao. I had to decide a case in volving the fraudulent character of a horse race, held in the San Lazaro Hippodrome. I appointed Col. Telesforo Martinez, an honest and upright veteran, then Chief of the Public Order Division to make the in quiry immediately. He submitted a report upon receipt of which I or dered the dismissal of the judges, the disqualification of a jockey — the details I don't remember — and cancelled the race and or dered the devolution to the public of the amount or amounts in volved In the controversy. This decision, I was in for med, in curred the dissatisfaction of the persons adversely affected. XXVI Early morning of June 5, 1943, while I was playing golf at the Wack Wack Country Club in Mandaluyong, with Dr. Nicanor Jacinto, President of Far Eastern University Nicanor Reyes, Dean Leoncio B... Monzon Liling Roces, Aurelio Montinola, Sr. and Enrique Katigbak in two groups. I was treacherously shot from behind just about 12 or 15 yards:, from Tee No. 7 where 1 was standing by. With the help of Dr. Jacinto, Dean Monson and Pres. Reyes, I was taken to my car and moved to the Philippine Genera! Hospital where I was at tended by Drs. Antonio Sison, Nicanor Jacinto, Ramon Macasaet. Januario Estrada. Fortunato Guerrero, Col. Ishii and others. I stayed in the hospital for about two months. XXVII. There was a great deal of discussion as to why I was at tacked. I myself, to the present day, do not know. The current belief was because I was a pro. Japanese. The other version was because of the San Lazaro in cident ment ioned in the preceding paragraph. 1. of worse, deep resented the cowardly and treacherous character of the at tack, but 1 felt more the accusation that 1 was pro-Japanese was not pro-Japanese Furthermore, I was in the government against my wishes and if I remained it was because of specific in struction of President Quezon and deeply. my heart I mild not love the Japanese more than my own people. The other reason (S. Lazaro in cident) was also possible but seemed to have been discarded by the Japanese military and Filipino civil authorities. Motive of personal character was likewise discarded because I had no personal enemies. Because of the position I held in the Executive Commission which was the civil agency created by the Japanese military authorities, the Kentpeilai (Japanese Military Police) arrested a number of people and after a few days published the photographs of some four or five persons said to have been killed or executed for alleged at tempt against my life. I told the Military Police (through Captain Yanase) that I did not believe they were the authors of the crime and that the finding of the Manila Police under Col. Torres seemed more rational pointing to a certain \"Little Joe\" as the guilty party. He (Little Joe) great physical similarity to the man who had assaulted at the Wack Wack golf course. This Little Joe was later demanded by the Kempeitai but I told them that I was not certain whether he was the man and that they (the Japanese) having already found (according to them) and executed the guilty 291 parties with out consulting me. this man (Little *Joe) should not be executed. This at titude of mine reached the knowledge of some people and I received an anonymous letter admiring \"my bigness of heart\" The truth is that, having assumed the obligation to help my people to survive and to tide them over to better times I did not want to be in anyway responsible for the killing or suffering of any of my countrymen. I condemn. cowardice and treachery but I must respect the political ideology of people plunged into desperation in a situation in which I played an important role. XXVIII Whatever the reason or motive behind the shooting at Wack Wack, I at tracted considerable public at tention. My survival was marvelous. The people who have known me, the sacrifice I was making, the in struction I had received from President Quezon. my own public record, my little reputation earned during more than 35 years of public service brought me more for cibly to the at tention of the Japanese administrators. And so, when the preliminary steps had to be taken with a new to Philippine in dependence I was at the head of the list of the Filipinos who were to in tegrate the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence.' The members of this Commission were, it is true, named by the Kalibapi which had been specially called for the purpose. but the selection had to be made from the list in for mally submitted by the military police.

Benigno Aquino was unanimously elected Speaker and the reafter I was unanimously elected by the National Assembly President of the newly established Republic of the Philippines. The details, pertaining to the election, or ganization, etc. of the Assembly are omitted. But it should here be ment ioned that Chairman Vargas participated as President of the Kalibapi. 292 XXX After my election and that of Speaker Aquino, we (Aquino, Vargas and 1) were in vited (requested) to go to Tokyo to pay our respects and to report. Mr. Vargas as the retiring chairman of the Executive Commission, and Speaker Aquino and I as newly elected Speaker and President of the impending Republic of the Philippines, respectively. I think we left the Philippines on or about September 29, 1943, by plane: passed the night at Fukuoka and arrived at Tokyo Haneda airport) the following day. We remained seven! days (3 or d) in Tokyo; we paid respects to His Majesty, the Emperor and registered our names as visitors of other members of the Imperial family, a banquet was given in our honor by Premier Hideki Tojo in the latter's of ficial residence and of ficial calls were made on the Ministers of War, Navy Foreign Affairs and of Greater East Asia. The most transcendental event, however, was the in vitation extended to us by Premier Tojo in the afternoon of the day following our arrival in Tokyo. After or dinary salutations, we were closeted in a conference room adjoining the reception room of his of ficial Residence; Messrs. Jose G. Sanvictores and Leon Ma. Gonzales who accompanied us to Tokyo were not allowed to be present; and after Premier Tojo, Minister Shigemitsu (Foreign Minister) and Aoki (Minister of Greater East Asia), Ambassador Murata, Gen. Wachi and others had taken their seats around a rectangular table, Premier Tojo rose and read his in structions (translated by Mr. Hamamoto) asking us to declare war against the United States and Great Britain. I was seated in front of Premier Tojo and Mr. Vargas was seated on my right while Mr. Aquino, on my left. It was a shock to all three of us; we did not expect this in struction and we were not prepared to meet it on the spot. I silently prayed and said the Pater Noster. After the translation by Hamamoto of the speech of the Premier I got up to say as politely as I could that I could not comply with the request. I said that my people would not approve of it; that I could not carry them; that I have never been a popular leader, the three powerful leaders of the country being Messrs. Quezon, Osmeña and Roxas; that even if I should be willing to do what they wanted me to do, I would be a leader with out any following because the Filipinos were opposed to such a step; and that it would not be \"decent\" for the Filipinos to declare war against the United States that was their benefactor and ally and that only unworthy people could be expected to do that. The unprepared reply seemed to have impressed Messers. Vargas and Aquino and I was congratulated by them. Afterwards, I was given a copy of this speech of the Premier which I took along with me to the Philippines. After the meeting, I also met Messers. Sanvictores and Gonzales who were waiting for us in the reception room. I reported confidentially all that transpired to my cabinet and council of state and, I understand, Speak er Aquino also gave an account to the members of the National Assembly. I realized that I was in a most difficult situation. The at rocities reported to us, the Japanese feudal and cruel methods had created a deep hatred against the Japanese and I wished I had not been in this predicament of leadership. When at this time (September 30, 1943) we were asked to declare war against the United States and Great Britain it was evident that in dependence was being granted with that price; but we could no longer back out. In the language of Tojo our choice. was between extermination or freedom. (Guest House visit). — Personal conf. - Jan., 1943 - Vargas Commission. 293 XXXI.

XXXII The frequent change of command of the Japanese Army (from Homma to Tanaka to Kuroda -- to Terauchi — to Yamashita), the arrests, to rtures and disappearance of good people; the in at tention to and disregard of our pleas in behalf of our people; the commandeering of houses, animals, automobiles, trucks and properties of private citizens; the confiscation of food supplies; the complete disregard of human dignity; the conqueror's complex; the low non-christian civilization of the great mass of these conquerors; their domination of and dictation to our Government and Government of ficials -- the preaching contrary to actual deeds — these and more made it evident that the Filipinos were doomed under Japanese occupation or in fluence and that we were correct in simply trying to do what had to be done for the purpose of tiding our people over to better times; and that I was correct in repeatedly announcing that the primordial policy of the Government was that of national survival.\" It was during this time that as a matter of duty and personal admiration — to prevent liquidation — that I asked General Roxas to join the Government in any capacity. General Francisco had to transfer to Malacañan as my adviser on peace and or der because I was told he would land in Fort Santiago because of his connection with the guerillas, and had on that account to appoint Gen. Paulino Santos as Commanding General of the Constabulary; I had to advise Gen. Mateo Capin pin to play safe and he realized the menace from the military police, and so with many ex-service men of our Philippine Army, 294 like Gen, Alberto Ramos, Gen. Simeon de Jesus, Col. Martinez, Col. Poblete, Col. Sevilla, Col. Castañeda and many others. XXXIII Since I assumed the of fice of President in the midst of hardship and suffering of our people and after the at tempt against my life, I became in tensely religious. Everyday and evening, I would go down to the chapel of the Palace, unnoticed, to pray. After the prayer, I felt greatly relieved. Every Sunday morning I in vited my colleagues in the Cabinet and other friends to hear Mass in the Malacañan chapel and the reafter to take breakfast with me and then play golf on the other side of the Pasig River. Those who frequently came were Gen. Roxas, Don Ramon Avanceña, Chief Justice Yulo, Minister Recto, Minister Arsenio Luz, Minister Sabido and Secretary Abello. My deep and sincere concern was the salvation of our people. I or dered that everything that Malacañan had be given to the people, especially to the poor and suffering masses. I prohibited social functions in Malacanan. I even prohibited people calling on me on my birthday. I prohibited the giving of gifts to me and to high Government of ficials for any occasion. And I imposed upon myself and the members of the cabinet the one-course meal service in banquets and regular gatherings. Even in of ficial banquets which we had to give, only one course had to be served. I silently endeavored to share and feel the suffering of our people. I did not overlook the families of people who were away. Secretly and frequently with out success I in structed Mrs. Pecson, superintendent of Malacañan Palace, to help Mrs. Osmeña, Mrs. Romulo, Mrs. Valdes, Mrs. Abad Santos and others. Mrs. Pecson is in a better position to state what had been accomplished in this humble, yet sincere at tempt. By in stinct or some kind of premonition, my wife refused to live in Malacañan, Aside from her aversion to social life she did not like the Palace. I had to go to our modest Peñafrancia home after of fice hours every day and spend the night there with my wife and children. It was only about three months after my in auguration that she came to visit me in Malacañan and joined Mrs. Trining Roxas (wife of General Roxas) and Mrs. Angela Zobel (wife of Major Jake Zobel) to view the exhibition of cinematographic films in the Palace's for mal dining room. XXXIV... The days of my presidency were hectic days. Every day was a day of reflection and prayer. On my in auguration I wanted to visit the Sto. Tomas concentration camp and of fer some material relief to my American friends. I wanted particularly to see Mr. Clyde C. De Witt, my first American teacher in my native town, my lawyer in a case I had in my boyhood days and later my professor in law at the University of the Philippines; but I was sternly cautioned against it because it would be misunderstood by the Japanese. Instead, I visited the Philippine General Hospital where I saw and shook hands with Theo. Rogers (Business Manager of the Free Press) who whispered to me that he understood the situation; and also Mr. Heindenreich, for merly 295 superintendent of schools of Batangas. I was accompanied by Dr. Antonio G. Sison, Director of the Hospital on this occasion. I also visited the disabled Filipino war veterans in Calle S. Rafael, and the charitable and social welfare in stitutions all over Manila. God knows how deeply I sympathized with them. XXXV.

XXXIV... The days of my presidency were hectic days. Every day was a day of reflection and prayer. On my in auguration I wanted to visit the Sto. Tomas concentration camp and of fer some material relief to my American friends. I wanted particularly to see Mr. Clyde C. De Witt, my first American teacher in my native town, my lawyer in a case I had in my boyhood days and later my professor in law at the University of the Philippines; but I was sternly cautioned against it because it would be misunderstood by the Japanese. Instead, I visited the Philippine General Hospital where I saw and shook hands with Theo. Rogers (Business Manager of the Free Press) who whispered to me that he understood the situation; and also Mr. Heindenreich, for merly 295 superintendent of schools of Batangas. I was accompanied by Dr. Antonio G. Sison, Director of the Hospital on this occasion. I also visited the disabled Filipino war veterans in Calle S. Rafael, and the charitable and social welfare in stitutions all over Manila. God knows how deeply I sympathized with them. XXXV. Bearing in mind the in struction I had received from President Quezon --- (with the approval of Gen. Mac Arthur) vide pars. IX-XI — after prayers and meditation, I boldly announced my national policy, my political ideology, and my moral philosophy in my speeches, in terviews and conferences. The fundamental national policy, I said, was that of national survival. All around us was devastation and suffering. No food, no medicine -- not enough at least of the essentials of life. Means of communication and transportation disrupted; we could not drive away the Japanese because they proved stronger - but we must live and survive as a people, we must tide over our people to better times and for this purpose we must unite, love one another, stop killing one another because only the Filipinos can love the Filipinos. No for eigner can pretend to love the Filipinos more than the Filipinos the mselves. As to the political ideology, I said that the dream and aspiration of Filipino heroes and patriots have always been complete and absolute political freedom for the Philippines and that all true Filipinos are pledged to the realization of that ideal. I the refore stood for a Government of the Filipinos, by the Filipinos and for the Filipinos exclusively and alone with out the in terference of, or in junction, or dictation from a for eign power. I announced that my moral philosophy - the deeper foundation of my administration was that of righteousness which is divine and is common to all religions worthy of the name; that man lives in the triple world, physical, in tellectual and moral; that physical and ment al vigor (mens sana in corpore san o) is not enough, but that man's life must be dominated by moral principles. I the refore concluded that righteousness was the foundation of genuine popular and political leadership (Service to the people on the basis of Righteousness) 296 Lopez, Salvador P. “Bataan has Fallen” Presidential Museum and Library.

It was radio broadcasted in side Malinta tunnel in the evening of April 9, 1942. This message was written by Captain Salvador P.

The announcement was delivered by 3 rd Lieutenant Normando Ildefonso \"Norman\" Reyes on the \"V oice of Freedom\" radio broadcast. EXCERPT: RADIO BROADCAST MESSAGE, AS WRITTEN BY CAPTAIN SALV ADOR P. LOPEZ, DELIVERED BY THIRD LIEUTENANT NORMANDO ILDEFONSO “NORMAN” REYES ON THE “VOICE OF FREEDOM” RADIO BROADCAST OF APRIL 9, 1942 FROM MALINTA TUNNEL, CORREGIDOR: Bataan has fallen. The Philippine-American troops on this war-ravaged and bloodstained peninsula have laid down their arms. With heads bloody but unbowed, they have yielded to the superior force and numbers of the enemy. The world will long remember the epic struggle that Filipino and American soldiers put up in the jungle fastness and along the rugged coast of Bataan. They have stood up uncomplaining under the constant and grueling fire of the enemy for more that three months. Besieged on land and blockaded by sea, cut off from all sources of help in the Philippines and in America, the in trepid fighters have done all that human endurance could bear. For what sustained them through all these months of in cessant battle was a force that was more than merely physical. It was the force of an unconquerable faith—something in the heart and soul that physical 297 hardship and adversity could not destroy! It was the thought of native land and all that it holds most dear, the thought of freedom and dignity and pride in these most priceless of all our human prerogatives. The adversary, in the pride of his power and triumph, will credit our troops with nothing less than the courage and for titude that his own troops have shown in battle. Our men have fought a brave and bitterly contested struggle. All the world will testify to the most superhuman endurance with which they stood up until the last in the face of overwhelming odds. But the decision had to come. Men fighting under the banner of unshakable faith are made of something more that flesh, but they are not made of impervious steel. The flesh must yield at last, endurance melts away, and the end of the battle must come. Bataan has fallen, but the spirit that made it stand—a beacon to all the liberty-loving peoples of the world —cannot fall! All of us know the story of Easter Sunday. It was the triumph of light over darkness, life over death. It was the vindication of a seemingly unreasonable faith. It was the glorious resurrection of a leader, only three days before defeated and executed like a common felon. Today, on the commemoration of that Resurrection, we can humbly and with out presumption declare our faith and hope in our own resurrection, our own in evitable victory. We, too, were betrayed by Judases. We were taken in the night by force of arms, and though we had done wrong to no man, our people were bound and delivered into the hands of our enemies. We have been with mock symbols of sovereignty, denied by weaklings, lashed with repeated oppression, to rtured and starved. We have been given gall to drink, and we have shed our blood. To those who look upon us from afar it must seem the Filipino people have descended into hell, into the valley of death"

Three Years of Enemy Occupation, The Issue of Political Collaboration in the Philippines. Manila: People’s Publishers. 1946. Claro M. Recto held positions under the Laurel administration during the Japanese occupation. He was the Commissioner on Education, Health and Public Welfare from 1942-1943 and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1943-1944. After the war, he was arrested and tried for collaboration. In 1946, he wrote a defense and explanation of his stand in his book, Three Years of Enemy Occupation which narrated the views and actions of the Filipino elite during World War II. Known for his academic excellence and nationalist ideas, Recto fought his legal battle in court and was acquitted. In this excerpt, Recto highlighted the different views of the Americans and the Filipinos on the issue of collaboration. According to him, the Americans who remained in the security of their homes and were miles away from the brutality of the Japanese for ces cannot appreciate the courage of the Filipinos who faced the brutality of the Japanese conquerors. The Filipino leaders on the other hand were more aware of the nature and character of events in the Philippines and should not be “judged by standards of post-liberation thinking.” EXCERPT: Differences in points of new between Americans and Filipinos on the question of collaboration Three and a half years under the Japanese rule the Filipinos suffered a living death. They came to expect that each day would be their last upon this earth. They went throul,111 nameless to rtures and in dignities. Hunger was to them a physical, gnawing pain, to which hundreds succumbed daily in the streets, in the in ternment and prison camps, in the filthy dungeons of the military police. The American planes that began to come in September 1944, sweeping and irresistible, caused damage to civilian properties and casualties among the people. Later, more of them were to meet death on the beaches bombed and shelled by Americans, in contested areas in the path of their advancing for ces and, finally, in the terrible holocaust that reduced Manila and other cities and to wns into rubble and ashes. Still, the Filipinos kept their faith. For their loyalty to the United States they paid the supreme price in countless in nocent men, women and children abused and but chered by the Japanese, in thousands of homes destroyed; but even that was not too much to pay for redemption and, they hoped, for the peace that was to follow. However, it seems that peace and concord are not for them. Openly or behind the scenes, for ces are selfishly at work pulling wires that may plunge the country into more suffering and more misery. Now that the Filipinos need more than ever to be united, they hurl accusations and 299 recriminations against one another, the bitterness of which is in no way assuaged by the American leaders who, having expressed concern for their present situation, should be among the first to deplore the existence of in ternal dissension here. These men against whom principally the accusations are made have so far kept their silence; their hearts they still preserve the solicitude that, during all their years of public service, they have felt for the country and for the people; and in the spirit of true leadership that those years have in stilled in them, they did not wish to make matters worse by accepting their accusers' challenge to a public discussion, which would be unavoidably fraught with passion and prejudice. Those who alone can pass is easy to defy the enemy if one is thousands of miles away. They have unquestioning faith in the judgment of their countrymen who remained here with them under the Japanese rule and saw at first hand their acts and in ner motivations. The man in the street, the humble farmer in the field, the employee in the government, the true guerrilla who fought and suffered a thousand hardships not because of ambition for personal glory and postliberation political power, but because of pure desire to help the American cause; yes, the American prisoner of war and civilian in ternee—these are the ones who are in a position to pass correct judgment upon these leaders, because to gether they in separably underwent, bore the brunt of, and pulled through three long years of Japanese hell on earth. Not those who were able to escape abroad to engage in profitable undertakings or who fled to mountains not to fight the enemy but for reasons of personal safety, and lived there in comparative comfort and ease of mind, coming out of their self-exile and hiding enriched and acclaimed as heroes and superpatriots, only after the Japanese had all but surrendered to the returning victorious American armies"

At this juncture, it seems opportune to remind ourselves of the words of a French physician, a member of the French underground. to Demaree Bess, who quoted the statement ill his article ' 'Which Way Will France Go?\" appearing in the Saturday Evening Post's issue of November 18, 1944: ' 'Frenchmen who lived abroad came back here with preconceived notions about so-called collaboration, notions which are nosy being altered. It was easy, in New York or London, to be openly defiant of Germans, and it was tempting for the emigres to be self- righteous when they first returned home. But as they talk with those of us who stayed here, they are beginning to understand better what it meant to live under German occupation. The over- whelming majority of Frenchmen never left France, and their judgments about who were and who were not collaborators are beginning to prevail.\" 300 The American point of view Washington high of ficials and the rest of the American people who throughout Washington high of ficials and the rest of the American people who throughout the war remained in the security of their homes thou- sands of miles away cannot begin to appreciate the utter misery and defenselessness of the Filipinos in the face of the unexampled brutality and lack of principle of the Japanese conqueror. They can- not truly understand the bargainings, the evasions, the temporizings and the show of apparent cooperation with which the Filipinos had to placate the ruthless in vader until America could or ganize and bring back here her mighty armed for ces. At best, the American point of view with respect to the Philippines could not but be purely objective, so much so that according to Admiral Richardson, for mer Pacific Fleet Commander. in his recent testimony before the Pearl Harbor Investigating Committee. President Roosevelt told him in 1940 that he (the President) doubted whether the United States would enter the war even if Japan at tacked the Philippines, but that the Japanese could not always avoid making mistakes. That mistake was the at tack on Pearl Harbor. At the hearings before the Congressional Committee in vestigating Pearl Harbor it has been disclosed that in the high command conference held in February 1941, General George C. Marshall. then and until recently Chief of Staff, made the following statement: ' 'We really have two active defense issues—the Panama Canal and Honolulu. They are the two great outposts of our defense. We have some troops in the Philippines but the Philippines are so weak they could not be defended against any first class power. They would have to be sacrificed.\" General Marshall testified also before the committee saying that “he knew of no agreement before the veal' committing the United States to war unless she was at tacked.\" After these meaningful revelations, paradoxical though it may sound, we Filipinos should feel happy that the Japanese made the mistake of at tacking Pearl Harbor. That mistake decided the fate of Filipino democracy and civilization. Had the Japanese at tack been directed against the Philippines alone, the Filipinos, out of their loyalty to America, would probably have been in the tragic situation of fighting America's war with out America even being a belligerent. That, as the Americans would say, would have left the Filipinos hanging out on a limb. And with America out of the war, the Philippines, after a futile resistance which could have lasted month only, would have been definitely in corporated into the Japanese empire, not even as an ostensibly sovereign member of the co-prosperity sphere, because such propaganda stunt would have been superfluous, but as a mere colonial possession like Korea and Formosa. But Pearl Harbor was at tacked and America entered the war. It was not America, however, but the Philippines that became the gory battlefield of the war, and for over three years was virtually converted into one big prison camp. It was not American cities that were destroyed, American homes burned. fields laid waste, food supplies confiscated, private belongings looted, population 301 decimated by the action of the ruthless enemy. No American in the United States was deprived of his home and thrown into the street; or ever lived in stark. abiding fear of the Japanese spy and military police; or found himself between •non-cooperation\" and the enemy to rture-chamber; or felt the sting of a slap in his face, the cold steel of a bayonet in his entrails, the pain of burning flesh, or any of the countless to rture methods employed by the Japanese. It was only natural that the primary concern of the United States should be to win the war and to save as many American lives as possible in the process. The retaking of the Philippines was not an end in itself but part of an overall strategic plan.

The Filipino point of view On the other hand, the Filipino leaders who were left here. During the occupation could not, for the very reason that they are Filipinos, adopt the same detached at titude to ward their country. They had to tax their in genuity and make the most of their practical wisdom to meet the grave implications of the enemy in vasion and occupation, in the face of the defenselessness and bewilderment of the people. They had to feign cooperation and pretend to play into the hands of the wily enemy because the latter was not only suspicious but already convinced that the Filipinos were just waiting for the opportune moment to strike back. True they wished. as fervently as did the Americans the mselves, an American victory But at the same time, while they could not plan to bring about that victory they had to face perplexing problems that were immediate and no less urgent. While their faith in the ultimate triumph of American arms never faltered, they had to plan not for a month or two of enemy rule but for a protracted period that might well drag for many years. For America was, by her own admission. hopelessly unprepared and the prodigious scientific achievements and productive power that were to turn the tide eventually in her favor were not then reasonably fore- seeable in the near future. In the midst of those terrible realities this handful of Filipino leaders was entrusted with the task of looking after the well-being of their own people and trying to save the country from abject misery, even possible extinction. How well and effectively they went about that task, only those whom they served are competent to judge, not those in whose very selfishness the enemy found comfort and assistance. President Osmena himself, in his Leyte speech, said that there were those among the men who held public of fice during the Japanese occupation who were prompted by a desire to protect the people and comfort them in their misery, and to prevent the Japanese from governing directly and completely or utilizing un- scrupulous Filipino followers capable of any treason to their people. So, while the Filipinos who headed the government under the Japanese occupation, in tent as they were upon speeding up the liberation of the Philippines, were exultant over the for mation of 302 guerrilla units, because these meant so much to the American war strategy, they could not, on the other hand, feel so happy when the unwitting exploits of some of the guerrillas brought about reprisals and death to whole communities of in nocent people. And while the Americans. unaware of the real nature and character of the events here, could close their eyes to the countless robberies, rapes and murders commit- ted by lawless elements in the name of the resistance movement but really prompted by lust and personal vengeance, if not from motives of banditry pure and simple, these Filipino leaders could not so callously ignore them but, being powerless to repress them effectively, at least had to morally condemn them, because such horrible crimes and abuses had for their victims thousands of Filipinos and in the end weakened the power of resistance of our people against the common enemy. The conduct and actuations of the Filipino leaders cannot be judged by standards of post- liberation thinking. Some would say that for all their good in tentions the efforts of these Filipino leaders were of no avail, as they were not able to pre- vent the enslavement of the people. Considering the implacable enmity and bitter resentment between the Japanese and the great masses of the people, which was daily coming to a crisis, and the deep distrust professed by the Japanese to ward the Filipino of ficials, it is doubtful whether any group of men could have done better in the in terest of their people. It is a matter of public knowledge that there was at the time a current saying among the Japanese to the effect that with the exception of Ricarte and Ramos and their followers, the Filipinos were ninety-five per cent pro-Americans and five per cent liars. Under those circum- stances their efforts to protect the people could not meet with eminent success. But that fact does not make them criminals; and it is unfair to judge their actuations at the time, when the nation was dazed by defeat and everything was chaos and confusion, through the perspective of victory and by the present standards of post-liberation thinking. They started with hopefulness in the efficacy of what they had expected to do, but they could not then know the relentless character of Japanese bestiality and double-dealing they had to put up with later on, progressively became worse as the Japanese realized more and more the hostility and double- crossing tactics of the Filipinos, of ficials and masses alike. At any rate the events of the last four months of the occupation have shown that if there had been no pretense of co-operation the in discriminate slaughter of the Filipinos would have been carried out from the beginning and there would have been only a handful of them left to liberate in the end. What would the Americans have done? It would be in teresting, from the academic point of view, to know what would have happened if the Japanese had pressed their in itial success at Pearl Harbor and actually occupied Hawaii or some part Of the American mainland along the Pacific coast"

Would the Americans in those 303 places have shown an absolutely uncompromising stand and resisted the enemy to the last unarmed and defenseless man? Or while biding their time would they have also temporized and bargained for terins that would give them at least a reasonable chance of survival? The Americans in the Philippines, both soldiers and civilians, who surrendered to the Japanese or were captured or in terned, did exactly this. Self-preservation, in dividual or national, is an in stinct common to men of all races and to all countries of the world. If the war had been between the Philippines and Japan as the principal belligerents the Filipinos would probably have found some measure of protection in that very status. But the war was between the United States and Japan, and the Philippines became in volved only because it was under American sovereignty. It was a situation that was exploited to the fullest extent by the Japanese and made the basis of their propaganda that the Filipinos were not their enemies but brother Orientals whom they had come to free. At the same time it was used to justify the measures of coercion and punishment they employed, because if the Filipinos were not enemies they could not plead their pro-Filipinism as an excuse for openly refusing to cooperate with the Japanese. Such refusal meant, in the Japanese eyes, only one for and at tachment to the Americans, and this in turn meant certain to rture or death. Not only the Americans in the Philippines at the time of Pearl Harbor but also the Filipinos were sacrifice to America's unpreparedness. The problems thus faced at the time by these Filipinos now accused of political collaboration were, from the subjective point of view, much more difficult than those faced by the Americans who were concerned exclusively with the conduct and strategy of the war. The difference is so patent of ficials and certain sectors or the American press, is perhaps unconsciously for tified in its condemnation of these so-called political collaborationists by the belief that the moral fiber of a Filipino is weaker than that of an American, so that where one would be betraying his country by certain acts under a given situation the other would be in capable of in tending such betrayal by similar acts under a similar situation. Nothing else can explain why those brave American soldiers who surrendered to the Japanese in the Philippines and who were for ced to make statements plainly pro-Japanese o or tending to give comfort to the enemy. should be lionized and acclaimed as the heroes they really are, while the Filipinos who were for ced to make similar statements are now accused of having given aid and comfort to the enemy and are condemned in the eyes of the world even before they are accorded a trial. There is somewhere the purpose of exacting a higher measure of loyalty from the Filipinos than from America s own nationals. No other explanation can be conceived of why General Wainwright, and the other American generals and of ficers under his command, for in stance, were, as President Truman said, a sacrifice to America’s state of unpreparedness, while the Filipinos who perforce had to deal and bargain with the Japanese on account of that very unpreparedness should now be called traitors. While it is 304 true that these Americans were prisoners of war, from the standpoint of freedom to act, both they and the Filipinos were not free agents; they were both under pressure, taking or ders In a sense the pressure exerted on the from the erstwhile conquerors. Filipinos was greater, because while an American could not be properly requested to make a pro-Japanese or an anti-American statement, a Filipino who would decline to make not an anti-Filipino but a pro-Japanese or an anti-American statement would appear in the eyes of the Japanese as pro-American and, the refore, an enemy of Japan. “Executive Order No 40: Initiating A National Campaign For The Cultivation Of Idle Lands To Produce Food Crops.” Presidential Museum and Library. http:// malacanang. gov. ph/6369-executive-or der-no-40-s-1942/ Jorge B.

EXCERPT: FIRST-AID UNITS First-aid units will be or ganized on the basis of four persons and one automobile with driver to each party. Two ambulances with drivers and two at tendants for each ambulance will form an in tegral part of such units. Where regular ambulances are not available, they should be improvised from suitable motor vehicles in the locality. A sufficient number of these units will be or ganized in each com- munity so as to provide a minimum of one such unit to each 3,000 of population or major fraction the reof. The Philippine Red Cross will be responsible for the or ganization and training of all first- aid units. The in struction of such units should in clude the treatment of shock, hemmorrhage, fractures, unconsciousness, suffocation, electric shock, and burns and scalds, as contained in the usual first-aid course of in struction. In addition to this, in structions must be given in the proper treatment of gas casualties. Such in structions are briefly summarized below: 308 Localized areas of contamination on the body caused by blister gas (mustard) should be treated by removing the blister gas from the skin by using gasoline, alcohol, or naphtha as a solvent. To apply these solvents a small piece of cotton batting should be held between the finger and the thumb, only the end of it being dipped in the solvent. Rubber gloves, if available, should be worn while applying the sol- vent. It is important to avoid spreading the blister gas by rubbing or using an excess of solvent. Solvents only remove the blister gas — they do not destroy it. For this reason a succession of swabs should be used, and the contaminated swabs burnt or buried. If the above solvents are not readily available, the affected part should be thoroughly washed with soap and water. In all cases where there has been contamination it is advisable for the casualty to be washed completely with soap and water, in addition to the solvent treatment described above for the affected part. It must be emphasized that the success of any method of preventive treatment depends upon the promptness with which it is applied. Lung Irritant Gas Whether symptoms are present or not, any person who has been ex- posed to a lung irritant gas must, from the outset, be spared any further exertion. He must be kept lying down and be protected from chill. He should be removed as a stretcher case. Eye Irritant Gas Face the wind with the eyes open. Do not rub the eyes under any circumstances. If it is available, wash the eyes with a weak solution of boric acid. First-aid stations for the treatment of ambulatory cases will be established in each community. The personnel and equipment for these stations will be trained and furnished by the Philippine Red Cross. These stations will be located in such places and in such numbers as not to require an in jured person to walk any great distance. Existing hospitals will be expanded, and buildings suitable for hospitals will be selected for use as hospitals whenever present facilities are in adequate. The Philippine Red Cross is responsible for the determination of the adequacy of existing facilities and for arranging for their expansion where deemed necessary. The Philippine Red Cross is also responsible for the securing of additional buildings suitable for hospitals whenever present facilities prove in adequate^ Doctors, nurses, hospital at tendants and other personnel will be procured by the Philippine Red Cross. RESCUE UNITS 309 In each municipality rescue units will be for med whose duties are to rescue persons trapped in fallen buildings and in debris from such buildings. Each unit will consist of a leader and eight men, all of whom will be recruited from men skilled in the building trades. Rescue work requires a special knowledge of the method of handling and storing up debris in or der to prevent in jury to the persons being rescued and to the members of the rescue units. Rescue units will be or ganized by, trained by, and operate under, the district and city engineers. One such unit will be or ganized for each 6,000 of population or major fraction the reof. Tools and equipment for the use of these units will be provided by the local authorities. DEMOLITION AND REPAIR UNITS Units to handle demolitions and repair will, be or ganized in each community. The duties of such units are to clear streets of their wreckage, fill bomb craters, assist when necessary in the repair of damaged water and gas mains, sewers, electric transmission lines, etc. They also will cooperate with fire-fighting units when it becomes necessary to use explosives on or otherwise demolish structures in or der to prevent the spread of fire and to bring a fire under control. The personnel of these units should be recruited from persons skilled in construction work, the handling and use of explosives, street and highway repair, and general utilities repair and maintenance. These units will be or ganized by, trained by, and operate under, the district and city engineers. The strength and composition of each unit and the number of units in each locality will be determined by the district or city engineer after consideration of the in stallations to be maintained in each case. DECONTAMINATION UNITS Units for med for the purpose of decontaminating areas in which poisoned gas has been used will be or ganized in each community under the direction of district and city engineers. Each unit will consist of a leader and six men. One unit will be for med for each 5,000 of population or major portion the reof.

While such units should be trained in the approved methods of decontaminating gassed areas, they also should be trained to assist in rescue, demolition, or repair work. The first step taken by these units will be to work out, with danger signs and barriers, the contaminated areas. No unauthorized persons should be allowed to enter these areas. Decontamination work should then begin promptly. The following materials may be used for decontaminating work: a. Earth. Earth, sand, ashes, or sawdust may be spread over a contaminated area to provide temporary protection. The layer of covering material should be at least 3 in ches thick and will be much more effective if wet down with water. The 310 chemical used in the gas is not destroyed by this procedure but the covering layer will prevent the escape of further poisonous vapors. b. Water. Some gases are readily decomposed by water, and a liberal wetting of the contaminated area is sufficient to destroy them. With some gases such as mustard, water has no neutralizing effect. Therefore, even long after an area has been washed with water it is dangerous to sit or lie down the rein. If practicable, the area should be covered with a 3-inch layer of earth, sand, or ashes. Whenever it is available, chloride of lime should be used as in dicated below. c. Chloride of lime. This is a white powder which readily gives up its chlorine content when exposed to the air or moisture. It should be kept in air-tight containers and used immediately after removal from them. It combines quickly with blister gases (mustard) and if it is mixed with sand or earth no violent reaction will occur. The proportions should be about one part of chloride of lime to three parts of sand or earth. One pound of chloride of lime is required for each square yard of gassed area. In decontaminating machinery, woodwork of buildings, etc., chloride of lime generally can be more easily and effectively applied in liquid form with rags, swabs, or brushes. The solution used should consist of one part of chloride of lime to one part of hot water. d. Fire. An area covered with high dry grass or brush may be decontaminated by burning it, provided this can be done with out danger to nearby personnel or property. The heat in many in stances will cause a heavy cloud of mustard vapor to be given off down-wind during the burning. 311 Vargas, Jorge. Report of Philippine (Executive Commission) to the Director, J.

Coming from the devastation of the Second World War in 1945, this period starts with the rehabilitation of the country alongside its in dependence of the Philippines from United States as a sovereign nation-state in 1946. The period which starts from year 1945 to 1964 with the presidencies of Sergio Osmena, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos Garcia, and Diosdado Macapagal. This period in Philippine history can be characterized with the issues that pressed on with the nation-state as it was rebuilding itself from the economic impact of the war, the political turmoil that occurred in ternally with the in surgencies, and the changing alignments within the diplomatic arena in time of the Cold War. This section in cludes presidential in augural addresses, the state of the nation addresses, and other landmark speeches that defined the presidencies of Osmena, Roxas, Quirino, Magsaysay, Garcia, and Macapagal. These selections of fer the range of issues that can characterize the issues that were relevant during the period which in clude postwar rehabilitation, defense against in surgencies, diplomatic alignment with the United States and other countries, agrarian land reform, economic and cultural nationalism among others. Aside from these documents, documents from prominent nationalist statesmen such as Claro Recto and Carlos Romulo are in cluded to show perspectives prevailing within the same issues that beset the nation-state. In reading these documents, it can provide an understanding of the continuities and changes that occurred during this time when the nation-state was rebuilding itself alongside its own nation- building as an in dependent sovereign state. 321 Sergio Osmeña, State of the Nation Address, June 9, 1945 Popularly known as the \"Grand Old Man of Cebu,\" Sergio Osmeña (September 9, 1878 - October 19, 1961) served as the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines succeeding Manuel L. Quezon after the latter's death in 1944. Osmeña returned to the Philippines with General Douglas Mac Arthur and his soldiers on October 20, 1944. He then headed the Commonwealth government that was re-established temporarily in Tacloban, Leyte on October 23, 1944. In the wake of the Japanese defeat, Osmeña reorganized the government in response to the needs of the country. On March 7, 1945, he signed an Executive Order which provided the restoration of the executive departments before the war. On June 9, Osmeña called a spe ASSOCIATE sion of Congress where he delivered his first and only State of the Nation Address at the provisional quarters in an old school building at Lepanto Street in Manila. Osmeña delivered a comprehensive report on the work done by the Commonwealth government for three years in Washington, DC. He also described the social conditions in the Philippines during the war and acknowledged the valuable help provided by the Filipino guerrillas to the American for ces in the liberation of the Philippines. Excerpt: Message of His Excellency Sergio Osmeña President of the Philippines To the Congress On the State of the Nation [Delivered on June 9, 1945] GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS: Today, a moment of great historic significance, the voice of our people, muted throughout the long dreary night of enemy enslavement, is to be heard again in the halls of this Congress, through their duly elected representatives. It has been a long lapse of time since that day in November, 1941, when you were elected, to this day when you gather in your first session. We can hardly recognize our country after the cataclysm that has engulfed it. The war has left its livid scars everywhere—on our buildings as 322 well as on men’s souls. Probably nothing can more starkly summarize our present plight than the fact that the Executive and Legislative branches of our Government have to meet to day in a borrowed house because our Legislative Building is a heap of rubble and ashes, mute witness to the savage desperation of the beaten enemy. The tragedy that has afflicted our nation has lacerated our hearts. We all miss to day many dear and familiar faces that are no more. But perhaps no sorrow has to uched us more deeply than the passing of our beloved leader, Manuel L. Quezon. I know, however, that you feel as I do that his immortal spirit abides with us in this hour of trial and crisis, encouraging us to proceed with the arduous tasks that lie ahead. This great man, who dedicated his entire life to his country, died as he would have wanted to die—in line of duty. Soon his mortal remains, kept at the Arlington National Cemetery at Virginia, will be brought back to the Philippines, and we shall all have the opportunity of rendering him our last homage of admiration and affection. We shall erect him a monument so that we and our generations yet unborn may keep his memory enshrined in our hearts. The Philippines is the one territory under the American flag which has suffered the most at the in vader’s hands. Not only are its war casualties the highest in proportion to population, not only have its cities and to wns been destroyed and looted, its countrysides and farms laid waste, and its whole economic structure ruined, but its people have undergone more physical pain and ment al anguish than in any other part of the United States. As early as December 8, 1941, a few hours after her felon at tack on Pearl Harbor, Japan sent bombers and task for ces to the Philippines. Unavoidably turned into a battlefield, our country suffered heavily in men and property, especially in Bataan, where the Filipino-American Army battled the Japanese for ces for four long months"

As early as December 8, 1941, a few hours after her felon at tack on Pearl Harbor, Japan sent bombers and task for ces to the Philippines. Unavoidably turned into a battlefield, our country suffered heavily in men and property, especially in Bataan, where the Filipino-American Army battled the Japanese for ces for four long months. Then followed a period of enemy occupation, cruel and humiliating. No sooner had the fighting in Bataan ended than the enemy began the systematic looting of our country. There was no limit to what he could requisition with his worthless money. Even our barest necessities were commandeered. And when we tried to stand by our rights, force, ruthless force, immediately in tervened. With or with out cause, people by the scores were arrested and sent to prison and concentration camps—some to be to rtured, others to be executed. As time went on, we became more impoverished, while the enemy became still more cruel and arrogant. After undergoing three years of enemy domination, no people was a more pitiful sight than the Filipinos—lean, ragged and famished. I wish to stress the fact that the extreme suffering of the Filipinos and the widespread destruction wrought on our country has been due, in a large measure, to their unwavering loyalty to the United States. No people, I believe, has given so much proof of fidelity to the cause of the mother country as the Filipinos. 323... Unwilling to bow to the enemy, the Filipino people valiantly took up the struggle with all the strength they could muster. Patriotic groups soon sprang up throughout the length and breadth of the Archipelago. At first eluding the enemy, the guerrillas took to the mountains, but with the active support of the civilian population they quickly grew in number and strength to become a virtual challenge to the enemy. The story of the guerrilleros and of the civilian patriots who helped them, is an epic of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice. As far as possible they should be given recognition. Recognized guerrilla units have already been in corporated into the Philippine Army. As stated in Leyte, in praising the guerrillas we should not be for getful of the loyal civilians who were left behind and, at the risk of their lives, supported the resistance movement. Included among these civilians were those who, at the beginning of the war, were civil service employees or holders of subordinate positions in the government, and who remained at their posts to protect the people and extend to them all possible aid and comfort. They should, as a general principle, be recalled as soon as their services should be needed; only for strong reasons should they be deprived of their privilege to serve. This policy applies as well to elected provincial and municipal of ficials who were chosen in the election of 1940, thus giving due consideration to the will of the people as expressed at the polls... But the tasks of peace are at times more exacting than those of war. We are administering the affairs of eighteen million people just delivered from three long years of enslavement. To them we owe justice, or der and the means to live in contentment and happiness. I am aware that our means at the moment are in adequate. We are not able to provide our people with as much as they deserve. But we shall not falter in the line of duty. Let us get to gether in one mighty effort. Let us set aside selfish considerations and for get petty differences. Only in unity can there be strength. To the experienced, I turn for advice. From the youth of the land, I ask for its enthusiasm and energies. My faith in our people is unbounded. Over the ruins of our cities and barrios we shall build anew. In this most crucial hour of our history, I look for ward to our destiny unafraid, confident that, God willing, ours will be a happy, progressive and prosperous land. In closing, permit me to congratulate you most heartily for being the first elective Congress to meet in a country liberated from the enemy, although the Philippines is among the last to be free from enemy occupation and control. I wish you all success in discharging the tremendous responsibility that is yours during the present emergency. 324 Republic Act No. 1400 Land Reform Act of 1955 An Act Defining a Land Tenure Policy, Providing for an Instrumentality to Carry out the Policy, and appropriating for its implementation.

Garcia (November 4, 1896 - June 14, 1971) assumed Presidency after the sudden death of Ramon Magsaysay in 1957 and was elected for a full four-year term on the same year. Before becoming the President of the country, Garcia was concurrently the Vice President and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 1953-1957. He was the Representative of the Third District of Bohol (1925-1931) and was a Senator under the Roxas and Quirino administration. Garcia's Presidency is known through its Filipino First Policy as a response to America's economic dominance in the Philippines during the postwar period. This policy aimed to assert Filipino role in the country's economy by prioritizing Filipino-owned businesses and patronizing Filipino-made products. In this message of President Garcia on the State of the Nation in 1960, he explained the significance of the Filipino First Policy \"to regain economic in dependence\" which will lead to the country's economic progress. Garcia in stituted the policy with the National Economic Council issuing Resolution No. 204 on August 21, 1958. Aside from economic nationalism, Garcia also ment ioned other important focus of his administration which in clude: rural development; development of new for eign markets; education and science; National Defense; Public works; and health. Excerpt: Message of His Excellency Carlos P. Garcia President of the Philippines To the Congress On the State of the Nation [Delivered on January 25, 1960] Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress: In the light of what has been accomplished since I last had the honor to address you, it is with an uplifted spirit that to day I call for further determined and courageous action to ward the great national goals. 328 During the year 1959 we to uched a few peaks in progress’ highway. We piled up bigger surpluses in. rice and corn, thus firming up our success in the campaign for self-sufficiency in food. We have achieved favorable balance of trade for the first time in postwar years which is a definitive in dex of our economic growth. The nation was thrilled by the discovery of oil in Cebu which, to gether with steel, will give revolutionary impetus to our agro-in dustrial economy. Oil will soon be a mighty pillar of our economy. We launched the first ship built by Filipino naval architects and engineers which established once and for all our capacity in this field. This is significant and in spiring when we consider that we are a country of 7,000 islands. We have successfully conducted a peaceful, free and honest election in which the Filipino people reiterated confidence in the present Nacionalista administration. It was an untrammeled expression of the popular will and the overall result was the strengthening of the fabric of Philippine democracy. We have just laid the cornerstone of a Nuclear Center made possible by the United States granting us an Atomic Reactor. We have thus been ushered into the threshold of a spectacular in dustrial revolution with the use of at omic energy. All of these achievements in the past year, to ment ion only the most outstanding, are at the same time pledges at a bigger to morrow. THE “FILPINO FIRST” POLICY The ”Filipino First” policy of this administration received a resounding popular in dorsement in the last election. Politically we became in dependent since 1946, but economically we are still semi-colonial. This is especially true in our for eign trade. This policy is the refore designed to regain economic in dependence. It is a national effort to the end that Filipinos obtain major and dominant participation in their own national economy. This we will achieve with malice to wards none and with fairness to all. We will accomplish this with full understanding of our in ternational obligations to wards our friends of the Free World. We will carry this out within the framework of our special relations with the United States to whose citizens we granted until 1974, by Constitutional provision, equal rights as Filipinos in the exploitation of our natural resources and public utilities, and to whom we also granted trading parity rights under the Laurel-Langley Agreement. Under this policy we will welcome friendly and understanding for eign capital willing to collaborate with us in the exploitation of our vast natural resources preferably on joint venture basis. It is my hope that legislations under this or ientation will be enacted this year. ECONOMIC PROGRESS In vital matters related to the national economy, at the start of last year, we were facing serious difficulties. The in ternational reserve stood at a dangerously low level and the financial position of the government was weak. So when I came before Congress to speak on the state of the nation, I proposed bold and decisive moves to stabilize the economy. 329 Congress in a historic special session patriotically responded by exacting a stabilization program the principal feature of which is the imposition of a margin fee on the sale of for eign exchange. In the middle of July a 25 per cent margin was put into effect. It speaks highly of the courageous statesmanship of this Congress that in spite of a stormy opposition accompanied by gloomy predictions of the prophets of doom, it passed the measure even in an election year"

It speaks highly of the courageous statesmanship of this Congress that in spite of a stormy opposition accompanied by gloomy predictions of the prophets of doom, it passed the measure even in an election year. Now after barely five months of implementation the reof we find that we were able not only to halt the country’s deteriorating balance of payments, but also to reverse it for the first time in postwar years from minus to plus, The 25 per cent margin on for eign exchange sales combined with the other disinflationary fiscal and credit restraint measures such as new tax laws, the cutback in bond financing, and such monetary in struments as the raising of reserve requirements, the raising of rediscount rates, selective rediscounting, the imposition of portfolio ceilings, and the continued effectively of Central Bank Circular No. 79, have produced general salutary effects upon our national economy. Among these are: (1) the strengthening of the peso, (2) the strengthening of our in ternational reserve to the tune of $162.9 million, (3) the consolidation of the government’s financial position, (4) the cutting down of excessive money supply, (5) the keeping down of excess bank reserves and credit, and (6), worthy of repeated ment ion, the at tainment for the first time in postwar history of a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments to the tune of $46.4 million. Moreover, we paid in 1959, $84 million of our for eign loans and obligations. Rural Development Greater efforts should be made to diffuse the benefits and balance the economic development among the rural regions of the country. During the past year, I consistently advocated the dispersal of in dustries to the provinces to halt the dangerous tendency of overcrowded population in cities and to stop in flation of monetary circulation in Manila and suburbs while there was scarcity of money in the provinces. The success of our program of self-sufficiency may be gauged by the in creasing surpluses of rice and corn. Such surpluses have not only in troduced price and marketing problems but also necessitate the reorientation of our production policies along the following lines: (1) redirection of our research activities to wards high-yielding varieties suitable to the needs of for eign markets; (2) further studies in the development of new in dustrial uses of agricultural surpluses and raw materials; (3) improvement in our management practices so as to in crease the production per hectare and the reby reduce the cost per unit of output; and (4) at tunement of production to market demands so as to avoid undisposable surpluses and achieve steady and fair in come for farmers. For in stance, some Virginia to bacco lands in the Ilocos provinces, in the face of a 330 soaring to bacco surplus, may be shifted to cotton production needed by our expanding textile mills. EDUCATION AND SCIENCE We have continued to extend the benefits of education to an in creasing number of children. Last year we were able to admit 119,000 new pupils by opening 3,000 additional classes. However, because of budgetary limitations, the Government has had to fall back upon private in stitutions to supplement its educational efforts. To maintain the highest standards possible in these schools, an in crease in the supervisory force would be desirable. The teaching of science and mathematics as well as the improvement of the vocational curricula received greater impetus during the year. Radio broadcasts through a donation of 500 transistor radios from the Australian Government were started this year. The production of foodstuffs, as well as the promotion of home in dustries, has been pushed with greater vigor. The creation of the National Science Development Board has given fresh impetus to the promotion of science and technology. Its research activities are geared to economic development and national health. For the first time all the research projects for the control of the dreaded kadang-kadang of coconuts have been consolidated in a Research Committee under the Board. National Defense Aside from pursuing its primary mission, the Department of National Defense has supplemented the rural development program of the Administration. In this connection, I wish to in form you that plans for the implementation of the Armed Forces commission under the law to engage in public construction, food production, land resettlement, and rural development in addition to its in herent duties have been completed. In fact, several projects are already being actually undertaken. Our Armed Forces, I am proud to say, has done well in the maintenance of peace and or der and the enforcement try’s defense structure. We have every reason to be proud of the laws. It was the principal arm of the Commission on Elections that conducted in 1959 free, peaceful, and honest national elections. Its civilian chiefs and its general staff have accomplished much in the way of improving the count of its of ficers and men. They will continue to be an in valuable asset to the life of the nation. Public Works Under the retrenchment policy, the Government has confined itself to the construction and improvement of only essential public improvements which are supportive and promotive of agro- in dustrial development. Nevertheless, during the calendar year 1959 the Government undertook the construction of irrigation and water supply systems, flood control and shore protection works, airfields and airports, ports and harbors, and roads and bridges for which we in vested One Hundred Sixty-Nine million pesos (P 169 million). Worthy of note is the completion of national and communal irrigation systems and the in stallation of irrigation pumps, all of which can now irrigate about 45,000 additional hectares of agricultural land. The year 1959 also saw the virtual completion of the construction of 768 kilometers of development highways in Mindanao"

I in vite the at tention of Congress to the emerging need of legislation directed to wards the multi- phase utilization and exploitation of the abundant water resources of the country not only for 331 power, but also for water supply, flood control and irrigation. In this way we can maximize the benefits for lowest cost. In the case of other public works financed with dollar loans being extended both by the U. S. Export-Import Bank and the Development Loan Fund for transportation projects—air, land, and water—committed under the Eisenhower-Garcia communique on the occasion of my last state visit to the United States, legislative measures are necessary to make available sufficient peso support for projects already submitted to, or approved by, these lending in stitutions. Health The health of the nation has been maintained at a satisfactory level. The birth rate has shown a considerable in crease whereas the death rate has decreased. Mortality rates from the ten leading causes of death have been reduced. All of these facts in dicate an improvement in the cleanliness and sanitation of our communities. The policy of improving the rural health centers is being pursued with out letup. To supplement the services which have been made available to the rural areas, the help of private persons and firms has been enlisted. Efforts are being exerted to expand hospital services in the rural areas. 332 Ramon Magsaysay, Rizal Day Speech, June 19, 1956 Recognizing the important role of Jose Rizal in the at tainment of our country’s freedom, President Ramon Magsaysay signed the Republic Act 1425 also known as the Rizal Law on June 12, 1956. Sponsored by Senator Claro M. Recto, the law requires “to in clude in the curricula of all public and private schools, colleges and universities courses on the life, works and writings of Jose Rizal, particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo…” The enactment of the said law was Recto’s response to the postwar social crisis of neocolonialism and colonial ment ality. The reading of Rizal’s novels according to him “would strengthen the Filipinism of the youth and foster patriotism.” In his speech on Rizal Day of 1956, a few days after he signed the Rizal Law, Magsaysay emphasized the need to remember Rizal on his birthday and the importance of “living for our country.” He highlighted the idea of “positive nationalism” that Rizal showed by understanding the social problem and presenting solutions to these challenges. Rizal Day Speech of His Excellency Ramon Magsaysay President of the Philippines Before the Lions Clubs [Delivered at the Manila Hotel, June 19, 1956] LION CHAIRMAN MARIANING DEL ROSARIO, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE MANILA BAY AREA LIONS CLUBS, MY FRIENDS: PERMIT me to thank the of ficers and members of the Bay Area Lions Clubs for this privilege of addressing you on this day. You are to be commended for stressing with this celebration the significance of the anniversary of the birthday of Jose Rizal. Indeed, it is time perhaps that our people should give to the day of his birth the same at tention and importance that we give to the day of his death, for there are many things about Rizal that we can learn by reflection on his life which we might miss in reflecting on the tragedy and the glory of his death. The recent generations of our people have had many occasions in which to die for our country. When those times have come, it has been the heroism of Rizal in the face of death that in spired them in battle or in the face of the executioner. Today, however, you will perhaps agree with me that we are mainly concerned with living for our country. We are concerned with giving life, a decent life, to the millions of our people. We 333 are concerned with giving life and strength to our national freedom and in dividual liberties. We are concerned with giving life to our Constitution and to the laws that our own free representatives have enacted for our welfare. In implementing this concern the question that we ask about Rizal is not so much “how did he die?” as “how did he live?” And this day is a good day in which to seek the answer. How did Rizal live? Perhaps we should first ask—What did he live for? Rizal lived for his country. How did he live for his country? He lived for it first by understanding the problems of the Philippines of his day. He faced the realities which the for ces of his country had created around him. He singled out the enemies of his country’s freedom. And then he chose the most effective weapons with which to conquer them. He learned how to wield these weapons. And finally he used them effectively and decisively to defeat the enemy and bring freedom to his people. What do we not find in Rizal’s life? We do not find him fighting the battles of Lapu-Lapu with 16 th century swords or haranguing his countrymen with the rough, rustic eloquence of Dagohoy. We find him fighting the enemies of his time with the weapons of his time, with the polished satire of the 19 th century, seeking the reby not only to awaken the spirit of his own countrymen but also to stir up the sympathy of the most cultured centers of Europe to wards the cause of his country’s freedom. Such was the realism of Rizal. Such was the constructive bent of his patriotism. Such was the positive spirit of his nationalism. Indeed, in every period of a country’s history, it is true nationalism that gives its people that necessary energy with which to conquer the problems of their times"

Such was the realism of Rizal. Such was the constructive bent of his patriotism. Such was the positive spirit of his nationalism. Indeed, in every period of a country’s history, it is true nationalism that gives its people that necessary energy with which to conquer the problems of their times. It is the realistic, constructive, and the positive nationalism of Rizal which, by facing present problems with present solutions, will propel us in the right direction to wards the security, the prosperity, and the happiness of our people. What are our problems to day? They are to permit the enjoyment of the fruits of our freedom by as many of our countrymen as possible, to harness our resources and gather economic strength with which to support that freedom, and to prepare ourselves to defend that freedom against the for ces that threaten to destroy it. We can in spire ourselves to solve these problems by recalling the principles of our dead heroes. But we cannot actually solve them by using obsolete weapons, recalling old hatreds and resurrecting buried enemies. We can, like Rizal, learn from the past with out reviving the problems of the past and with out shadow boxing with the spirit of the vanquished foe. It would be wrong, for in stance to approach our coming relations with Japan by recalling our hatred of the Japanese militarist even though it was barely ten years ago that we suffered under his yoke. Let us recall that Rizal himself had a high respect for the in trinsic humaneness of the Japanese people. As with the ten year old hatreds, so must we deal with the older ones. Let us nourish in our hearts a love for our country that looks for ward. Let us nurture a love that builds and will not destroy the very things that support our freedom. Rizal said “the glory of saving a country is not for him who has contributed to its ruin... Hate never produces anything but monsters; and crime, 334 nothing but criminals... Love alone realizes successful works; virtue alone can save... Redemption presupposses virtue; sacrifice, love...” My friends, countless problems challenge our solution. They can be solved if we get to gether in spired with love for our country and for our countrymen and if we approach them with goodwill and with out rancor or abuse. A country can achieve lasting greatness only if that greatness is built on the sound constructive bases of virtue, sacrifice, and love. For countries, like persons, must also be judged by the moral code. Rizal said “If to make my country happy I should have to do evil, I would refuse to do it, because I am sure that what is built on sand must sooner or later fall to the ground.” If we must build for the future, we must solve the present with the solutions of our time. If we must strengthen our freedom we must use the resources at hand. If we must defend that freedom, we must know who is its real enemy to day and prepare to foil him with the weapons of to day. If we want to help our country, we must be prepared to sacrifice ourselves. But to sacrifice ourselves we must be possessed of love—love for our God, our country, and our people. If our devotion to Rizal is sincere and genuine, then we must remember, each and every one of us, that we owe it to ourselves and to our country to seek constantly to discipline ourselves and dedicate our efforts to our country. As Rafael Palma has said, we have a right to believe that there is in each one of us a possible Rizal; and that what he has done, we too could do within our reach and capabilities, if we would only apply to our tasks the same determination, the same resolute action, the same sense of duty that Rizal applied to the most heroic acts of his life. Let, then, this commemoration of Rizal’s 95 th birthday in spire in each of us a firm determination to dedicate ourselves anew with a chastened spirit and renewed vigor to this our beloved country which Rizal, blessing her with his blood, has bequeathed to us, for us to love, to dignify, and to serve. 335 Inaugural Address of President Magsaysay, December 30, 1953.

I accept the trust humbly and gratefully. My sole determination is to be President for the people. The of fice of President is the highest in the land. It can be the humblest also, if we regard it – as we must – in the light of basic democratic principles. The first of these principles is the declaration of the Constitution that “sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates form them.” This simply means that all of us in public of fice are but servants of the people. As I see it, your mandate in the past election was not a license for the selfish enjoyment of power by any man or group of men. On the contrary, it was an endorsement of the principle – at times for gotten – that the general welfare is the only justification for the exercise of governmental power and authority. 336 Your mandate was a clear and urgent command to establish for our people a government based upon honesty and morality; a government sensitive to your needs, dedicated to your best in terests, and in spired by our highest ideals of man’s liberty. We have a glorious past. Now we must build a future worthy of that past. It is significant that we begin on this day and on this ground hallowed by the supreme sacrifice of Jose Rizal. We can find no finer example of dedication to country to light our way. All too of ten, however, we speak of Rizal – and of Del Pilar, Bonifacio, Mabini, and our host of heroes – as if their work were done, as if to day their spirit had ceased to have any meaning or value to our people. The truth is that we need their spirit now more than ever. We need it to complete the work which they began. We need men of in tegrity and faith like Rizal and Del Pilar; men of action like Bonifacio; men of in flexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, their self‑reliance, their capacity for work, their devotion to service, their ability to lose the mselves in the common cause of building a nation. I will have such men. From this day, the members of my administration, beginning with myself, shall cease to belong to our parties, to our families, even to ourselves. We shall belong only to the people. In the administration of public affairs, all men entrusted with authority must adhere firmly to the ideals and principles of the Constitution. I will render – and demand – uncompromising loyalty to the basic tenet of our Constitution; that you, the people, are sovereign. The rule of government must be service to you. Accordingly, I pledge my administration to your service. I pledge that we shall extend the protection of the law to everyone, fairly and impartially – to the rich and the poor, the learned and the unlettered – recognizing no party but the nation, no family but the great family of our race, no in terest save the common welfare. The Bill of Rights shall be for me and the members of my administration, a bill of duties. We shall be guardians of the freedom and dignity of the in dividual. More than this, we shall strive to give meaning and substance to the liberties guaranteed by our Constitution – by helping our citizens to at tain the economic well‑being so essential to the enjoyment of civil and political rights. 337 The separation of powers or dained by our Constitution – as an effective safeguard against tyranny – shall be preserved zealously. Mutual respect for the rights and prerogative of each of the three great departments of government must be observed. The legislative power vested by the Constitution, in the elected representatives of the people will, I trust, operate vigorously to prosecute our common program of honest, efficient and constructive government. As Executive, I look for ward to in timate cooperation with the members of Congress, particularly with those statesmen who have stood guard over the rights and liberties of our people. The in dependence of the judiciary shall be strengthened. Our courts must be freed from political and other baneful in fluences, so that they may function with the same in tegrity and impartially which have made our Supreme Court the for tress of law and justice. Heretofore, social justice has raised fervent but frustrated hopes in the hearts of our less for tunate citizens. We must not permit social justice to be an empty phrase in our Constitution. We must bring it to life – for all. In consonance with this purpose, my administration shall take positive, energetic measures to improve the living conditions of our fellow citizens in the barrios and neglected rural areas and of laborers in our urban and in dustrial centers. The land tenure system of our country shall be reexamined, to purge it of in justice and oppression. “Land for the landless” shall be more than just a catch‑phrase. We will translate it into actuality. We will clear and open for settlement our vast and fertile public lands which, under the coaxing of willing hearts and in dustrious hands, are waiting to yield substance to millions of our countrymen. Democracy becomes meaningless if it fails to satisfy the primary needs of the common man, if it cannot give him freedom from fear and on which a strong republic can be built. His happiness and security are the only foundations on which a strong republic can be built. His happiness and security shall be for emost among the goals of my administration. We must develop the national economy so that it may better satisfy the material needs of our people. The benefits of any economic or in dustrial development program shall be channeled first to our common people, so that their living standards shall be raised. While I shall give priority to our domestic problems, my administration will not neglect our in ternational responsibilities. We cannot escape the fact that, to day, the destinies of nations are closely linked"

No effect will be spared, no element of cooperation will be with held in strengthening and safeguarding our physical security. We are prepared to live up to all our obligations under our Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. To our Asian brothers, we send our fraternal greetings. They are beset by problems of the same nature and complexity as those that confront us. We in vite them to share our experience in finding solutions to those problems through democratic means. It is my hope that we can exchange experiences and in for mation on methods that each of us has found most effective in subduing illiteracy, poverty, disease, under-productivity, and other common evils which have afflicted our countries of past generations. The problems and opportunities ahead of us set the measure of the effort we must exert in the years to come. We must have unity to solve our problems, cooperation to exploit our opportunities. I urge you to for ego partisan differences whenever the national in terest clearly demands united action. We must not be distracted from our work. We have no time for petty strife. Certainly we cannot temporize with armed dissidence. I the refore call upon the remnants of the Huk uprising still hiding in the hills to lay down their arms – and rejoin the rest of the nation in the ways of peace. I say to the rank and file of the Huks – who have been misled by the lies of the Kremlin – that they can win the economic security and social justice they desire only within the framework of our democracy. We shall welcome back the truly repentant with understanding and with sympathy. But, to the leaders of the Communist conspiracy who would deliver this country and its people to a for eign power, this I say: I shall use all the for ces at my command to the end that the sovereign authority of this government shall be respected and maintained. There can be no compromise with disloyalty. I have been warned that too much is expected of this administration, that our people expect the impossible. For this young and vigorous nation of ours, nothing is really impossible! 339 Let us have faith in ourselves, the same faith that fired the heroic generation of revolution. They waged and won their struggle with nothing but bolos in their hands and courage in their hearts. Without political training and experience, they wrote a constitution comparable with the best, and established the first republic in Asia. Our own generation was told by doubters and enemies that we would never have in dependence from the United States. We live to day under a free and sovereign Republic. Our faith was fulfilled. Today, we are told anew that it is impossible to do what must be done. But our people, sustained by God, under whose protection we have placed our destiny and happiness, and strengthened by an abiding faith in His goodness and mercy – our people, united and free, shall shape a future worthy of our noble heritage if we but act; act to gether; act wisely; act with courage; and act unselfishly, in a spirit of patriotic dedication. 340 \"1947 RP-US Military Bases Agreement\" Accessed November 21, 2020.

He served as the president of the Philippines from 1961 to 1965. One of his known actions under his administration was the shift of the observance of the date of the Independence Day from July 4 to June 12, the date when the first Philippine Republic proclaimed its in dependence. The excerpt contains Macapagal’s view that an unrelenting struggle for freedom throughout the history of the Philippine nation was acknowledged in the change of the in dependence date and continued in the plight to seek the fullness of freedom through socio- economic development and agrarian reform.

The history of the Filipino people is an epic of an unrelenting struggle for freedom. Centuries ago, our for ebears sailed in frail vintas to settle in our islands in or der to escape from the despotism of their rulers in their aboriginal homes. In 1521, the European navigators led by Magellan reached our shores. Upon learning that the strangers came to place our land under the rule of Spain, our people under the Filipino patriot, Lapu-Lapu, fought to resist for eign rule, 369 resulting in the death of Magellan in the hands of Lapu-Lapu in the battle of Mactan. Finally succumbing to the power of superior arms and brought under the rule of the Spanish crown, the people revolted in termittently and in cessantly during the whole period of the one hundred and seventy-seven years of Spanish rule until finally a nationwide revolution led by General Emilio Aguinaldo and the founder of the secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan, Andres Bonifacio, under the in spiration of the Filipino hero and martyr, Dr. Jose Rizal, exploded and succeeded, resulting in the proclamation of Philippine in dependence in Kawit, Cavite, on June the 12, 1898, by General Aguinaldo and in the establishment of the Philippine Republic under a Constitution adopted in Malolos, Bulacan, with Aguinaldo as President of the Republic. At about this time, war broke out between the United States and Spain. Defeated in the war, Spain ceded in the Treaty of Peace to the United States the Philippines over which it had lost physical control. Again, the Filipino people resisted the implantation of American rule but were subdued by superior arms with the capture of Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, in 1901. Despite the magnanimity of American rule, the Filipino people continued the struggle for freedom for forty- eight years on the battlefield of peace under a new triumvirate of great Filipino political leaders, Manuel Quezon, Sergio Osmeña, and Manuel Roxas, until on July 4, 1946, the United States proclaimed, restored, and recognized the in dependence of the Filipino people as a free and sovereign nation. With the recognition of political in dependence in 1946, the centuries-old struggle of our people for freedom did not come to an end. What has been won so far is political freedom, which carries the sovereign right to choose the way of life under which our people desire to live. Political freedom is not an end in itself but a means to a greater end, for which our people are now called upon to continue their unfinished struggle—their unfinished revolution—for freedom. That greater end is economic freedom which would extend political freedom to the economic life of the people and which requires the liberation of the national economy from for eign dominance and above all, which demands the freedom from bondage to poverty and misery of the greatest number of our people. This is the new and continuing struggle for freedom in which our people are engaged to day. It seeks goals different from those sought in the military revolution of Aguinaldo and Bonifacio or from those sought by the peaceful revolution for political in dependence of Quezon, Osmeña, and Roxas. It seeks the readjustment and rectification of those conditions created in our society during four hundred twenty-five years of colonial status that do not conform to the spirit, idealism, and soul of the Filipino nation, to the end that the bounty which God in His generosity showered upon our land shall not be a monopoly of a privileged few but shall be shared by the greatest number of our countrymen. By its nature, this is a difficult endeavor as, in deed, all revolutions, violent or peaceful, are difficult endeavors. But it is a task that is in escapable and must be undertaken if we are to be faithful to the legacy of freedom for which our for ebears paid with their sacrifice and their blood. 370 There is one condition sine qua in this continued revolutionary struggle for economic freedom. It must be sought only through the ways of freedom. It must be so because since it is freedom in its fullness which our people have sought and fought for through generations and centuries, it would be an unpardonable monstrosity to seek that economic freedom through to talitarianism and not through the processes of liberty. Our national endeavor the refore is a search for the fullness of freedom through the medium of freedom. Thus, under the aegis of this freedom, we have striven with in creasing effectiveness to eradicate the evil of graft and corruption that has held sway in our government and among our people during the last sixteen years since the war’s end through a moral regeneration program that respects due process and the rule of law.

Indicative of the effectiveness of this program, production in agriculture, in dustry, and mining in 1963 started to exceed the production in 1961 and continues to expand. We have in vigorated the execution of an extensive program of public works, in cluding concrete highways, rural roads, ports, and airfields, to give support and impetus to the establishment of factories and other productive ventures by private enterprises. We have given specific boost to to urism as a feature of our economic program. The successful prospect of this undertaking is shown by the establishment at least, after many years of futile encouragement in the past, of a ₱20 million Manila Hilton Hotel which will place our accommodations for to urists at par with the highest world standards. 371 Realizing that liberation from bondage to the poverty of generations through our socio-economic program will require some time, we have in the meantime endeavored to in sure our people against critical want by assuring at all times the rice and corn which is their food at reasonable prices while assuring profits to the palay growers. We have assured that the people have ready access to low-cost fish and other prime commodities, and we have provided ready job opportunities for those in critical need of in come. We are selling the lots and houses of the People’s Home-site and Housing Corporation to their occupants to which they previously only had leasehold rights, and we have built multi-storey tenements for the virtual in digents to give them freedom from a sense of homelessness. We have given free lots to the in habitants of a large part of military land to satisfy their aspiration to own the lots on which their homes are built, as their for bears had yearned to do for a hundred years. We have given particular support and assistance to the textile and garments in dustries to provide decent and in expensive clothing to our population. We have sold a multi-million government textile factory to its workers to usher them to freedom from the drudgery of endless labor into the threshold of proprietorship. We have joined in an earnest coalition with the Labor Party to in sure the legitimate effort of the workers to safeguard their rights and pursue their welfare in the widest latitude of freedom and justice. While giving our people these urgent services, we have at the same time moved to wards stable abundance by seeking the establishment by statute of a Rice and Corn Authority to at tain self- sufficiency in rice and corn by establishing the Fisheries Commission to in crease our fish supply, and by effectively promoting basic in vestments that would create permanent job opportunities. Among the in vestments which show the success of the program are the ₱450 million in tegrated steel plant in Iligan City, the ₱250 million pulp and paper factory in Bislig, Surigao, the ₱80 million banana establishment in Davao, the ₱80 million canned pineapple plant in Cotabato, the ₱60 million steel plate plant in Binangonan, Rizal, the ₱120 million fertilizer plant in Bataan, and others too numerous for exhaustive ment ion. To assure to our youth freedom from ignorance we have avoided the recurrent school crises and have embarked on massive construction of new school buildings. We have likewise sought from Congress the establishment of a Workers’ University to give an opportunity to the deserving children of the poorest families to acquire university education. We have respected with full understanding and with out reprisal the freedom of the press and other media to criticize the Administration to the verge of license because we espouse the 372 principle that, given a choice between licentious freedom and its regulation, we are for the for mer because freedom possesses a quality of self-discipline that can remove its excesses while regulation may amount to regimentation that can lead to tyranny. We have cooperated in the freedom of our political adversaries not only to criticize the Administration but also to conduct in vestigations against the actions of executive of ficials believing that it is through free in quiries that the truth of the in dictment can be established or its falsity exposed. Without diminishing our ties with our closest ally, the United States, we have charted a wider course of freedom in dealing with other nations and in particular with our brothers in the Afro- Asian community. To carry out our program of prosperous life for our people in freedom, we have set the basic requirement of peace in the country by dealing the communist uprising a mortal blow through the capture of its “brain,” Dr. Jesus Lava. The final capture of Lava after eluding the authorities for eighteen years is not only a historic but significant event. Lava led a (movement that sought substantially the same economic freedom that we seek for our masses, but he sought his goals through the tactics of to talitarianism, tyranny, and violence that characterize communism.

The capture of Lava, the refore, should focus our minds on two things: firstly, that our struggle to achieve a better life for the multitudes of our people through the ways of freedom is proving to be the right course; the refore, thus encouraged, we can reassure our people that as long as we have the responsibility of steering the affairs and destiny of our nation, we shall endeavor to build a better country and a better life for our people not through any techniques of to talitarianism but through the established Filipino way of life—through peace, freedom, and the rule of law. Secondly, it should be food for thought to those who now enjoy in greater measure than others the bounty of our land that for the sake of our country and for their own sake, they ought to view with greater understanding and even support our energetic efforts to provide effective opportunities to the greatest number to at tain a better life through the ways of peace, freedom, and the rule of law because this is the course that will avoid the tragedy that has befallen other nations—in cluding nations around us— in which the in escapable struggle of the masses to share in the wealth of their country has been accomplished in the manner in which Lava and his movement would wish it to be achieved, through to talitarianism, tyranny, and violence, under 373 which not only wealth and comfort but life itself stands in danger of being lost. The affluent in our society should not ignore or for get these early the warnings and lessons of our recent history, when the alternative of violent protest rather than peaceful reform pursued by the communists almost succeeded in overwhelming us and, destroying the sources of their wealth and for tunes. To expand the area of basic peace upon which we pursue a prosperous and free life for our people, we have sought to use our good of fices to prevent tension and conflict in our in ternational neighborhood. To this end, after our in dependence ceremonies, much as I do not wish to leave our country at this time, I shall be constrained to fly to Tokyo to undertake this vital (mission. It is an hazardous mission that in volves our national in terest and that seeks for ourselves and our neighbors freedom from war. I need the good wishes of all in this momentous undertaking, for if it fails it will jeopardize the stability of our region; but if it succeeds, it will mean not only peace in our neighborhood but an in itiative in in ternational diplomacy that will bring honor to our entire nation. In summation, our commemoration of our day of freedom is, the refore, not an empty ceremony but is a realistic ritual of rededication to the substance of our lives and our aspirations as a people which consists in the fullness of freedom. Our celebration and jubilation on the day of our in dependence is as essential a part of our lives, as in dividuals and as a nation, as the air that we breathe, the food that we eat, and the God whom we worship. I need but make one more observation to end this speech. The struggle for freedom, whether political or economic, is truly a revolution. In other lands, it has become a violent revolution. In our country, we are lucky thus far that our revolution for a better economic life has been a peaceful one. But whether violent or peaceful, all revolutions demand sacrifice and for titude in the face of transitory hardship. If we are worthy of freedom, if we are worthy of the sacrifice and for titude of our heroes who left us a legacy of freedom, if we are worthy of the better life that we seek for ourselves, if we possess the manhood of a virile nation, let us not whimper in the face of transient hardship, let us not wail over in convenience and difficulty. Rather, as good citizens, let us do our share in this common struggle ready to sacrifice and to undergo hardship; let us work hard to gether, for this is the way to build a richer nation in free enterprise; let us realize that it is necessary for us to undergo the cavalry of sacrifice and hard work in or der to deserve and enjoy the redemption of a better and happier life. I end with the proud declaration of the truth that the Philippines is irrevocably a land of freedom. The love for freedom is the outstanding trait of the Filipino. Democracy and the freedom on which our government is founded have taken firm and very deep roots not only in the soil of our earth but also in the soul of our people. Having espoused peace, freedom, and the rule of law as their way of life, the Filipinos will rather die fighting for freedom than live under any tyranny, for eign or native. Because freedom is his devout wish on this in dependence day, the Filipino feels in side him that his freedom is still in complete. There will never be the fullness of freedom that the Filipino heart yearns for until it in cludes as a reality freedom from want, freedom from poverty, freedom from misery, freedom from a hopeless life of hardship and deprivation. As the 374 leaders of two preceding generations before us contributed their share essentially in the political sphere to the achievement of our people’s goal of freedom in its fullness, its expansion to the freedom of our multitudes from social and economic bondage to poverty is the task of our own generation. This is the in escapable task of all of us. On my part, with God’s benediction, I shall do my share of the enormous task the best way I know how. May God bless our people on this our day of freedom so that it shall become full and shall last unto eternity. 375 Romulo, Carlos P. “Crusade in Asia” pp. 125 – 127. in Romulo Reader.

Romulo (1898 – 1985) was an in tellectual and the country’s to pmost diplomat, having served as the secretary for for eign affairs under the presidencies of Quirino, Macapagal and Marcos. His track record in the United Nations, serving as one-time president of its General Assembly, showed that he was among the few Filipinos during the postwar period who made an impact in setting an agenda for in ternational relations and global cooperation. This document is an excerpt from Romulo’s resignation as the Ambassador of the Philippines to the United States, and concurrent the Permanent Delegate to the United Nations in 1953. The select sections of the document shows Romulo’s reason that a change of leadership is needed within the government. As of the writing of this letter, President Quirino was considering running for a second term, and Romulo, after having conversations with Quirino and reflections on the state of the country, Romulo made his resignation to his post in or der to address the clamor for a change in leadership. This letter shows Romulo’s resolve to resign for his post as his personal way to preserve the future of the emerging newly in dependent state through a renewed change in moral leadership. Excerpt: My letter of resignation to His Excellency Elpidio Quirino, President of the Philippines, written on May 14, 1953, reads, in part, as follows: DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: On board the Apo on May 1, the evening following my return to Manila at your behest, you spoke to me frankly about the reasons why you have decided to seek the nomination of our party 376 for the second term. I in for med you then that in my considered opinion it would be desirable in the national in terest that you reconsider your decision to seek another term. This statement rests upon the sober, impersonal conviction which I have reached that a change in leadership would not only be a good thing for the country at this time but is in deed an essential condition for our future progress. It also rests upon the equally sober realization that our people profoundly desire such a change. Our people to day are weary and confused. If they are not demoralized, it is because of the in herent spiritual power and the unshakable faith -which has distinguished them throughout the ages, through which they have always been able to recruit renewed strength of purpose to overcome the mightiest obstacles to their progress. Despite the restoration of a degree of economic stability, economic difficulties among our masses have been mounting. Economic in equalities have become more noticeable. These, with their natural concomitant’s political confusion, social decay and above all, a noticeably growing lack of public confidence in government have created a situation of grave national peril that is unprecedented in our history, and that has brought deep concern to all thinking men who have been witnesses of these phenomena. It has not been easy for me, Mr. President, to reach the conclusion that has been for ced on me by factors and stresses visible to so many of our countrymen, that our people are in a deep discontent under a burden of woes and grievances. These considerations have compelled me to the conclusion that the time has come for a salutary and necessary change in the leadership of our national life one which will remove from the palate of our people the stale taste of promises unfulfilled, or failures, and will provide the people with fresh resolve and in spiration, based on a reinvigorated faith in government. And here lies the crux of the present specific political situation, the implication of which candor compels me to note for your consideration. It cannot have escaped you that bitter feelings have 377 been engendered: and it is my conviction, shared by many, that a supreme gesture by you a gesture not so much of self-abnegation as of a vision that rises above the level of the moderately enlightened would act to dissolve these feelings in a solvent of national good will and understanding, and would avert consequences which you would be the first to deplore. Such an act on your part, all circumstances considered, would shine as an act of enlightened statesmanship and patriotism, would constitute a heartening recognition of our democracy's in herent capacity for renewal, and would establish you in a position of high moral leadership and in fluence 'which no mere political effort could give. I have addressed this letter to you in complete candor, out of a sense of patriotic duty. To tell you the unvarnished truth is, I believe, the highest form of service that I can render the party now. What happens to me personally is a matter of little consequence. It is the future of our country that is paramount. On this, I am certain, we agree. I am cognizant of the fact that by suggesting, as I do now, that you for bear, in the national in terest, from seeking nomination or election for another term, I am creating a situation in which you may feel that I no longer am capable of that complete meeting of minds which would make my continuance as your Ambassador to the United States, and Permanent Delegate to the United Nations, possible. For this reason I hereby have the honor to place in your hands my resignation from both posts. Sincerely yours, CARLOS P.

Source: https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/1963/08/08/address-of-president-macapagal-at- the-signing-of-the-agricultural-land-reform-code/ One of the most well-known accomplishments of President Macapagal is agrarian land reform through the enactment of the Republic Act No. 3844 or Agricultural Land Reform Code. The Agricultural Land Reform Code provided the establishment of a leasehold system between landlords and farmers which sought an end to the tenancy system that had been the prevailing system. The law also provided the authority to acquire and distribute agrarian land equitably as well as created a financial in stitution for such acquisition and distribution. In this document, President Macapagal signed into law this agrarian land reform program with him proclaiming that this was the culmination of the freedom of farmers. Through a historical overview of the struggles of the farmers from the colonial times to the in dependent state, the land reform code, according to Macapagal, served as a triumph not only to free the farmer from the oppressive system but to enable him to in vigorate productive agriculture for the economy of the nation-state. EXCERPT: Address of President Macapagal at the signing of the Agricultural Land Reform Code August 8, 1963 Address of His Excellency Diosdado Macapagal President of the Philippines At the Signing of the Agricultural Land Reform Code [Delivered on August 8, 1963] AN ACT OF EMANCIPATION WE ARE GATHERED here to witness a very simple act. The act itself will take no more than a few seconds, no more than a brief moment to affix a simple signature on the last page of a printed document. It will take no more than a few quick strokes of the hand. Yet in this brief moment are packed many centuries. This unspectacular act of signing a piece of paper will bring to an end a long and at times bitter past of economic and human slavery which we now make bold to abolish, and it will launch a new and better future for those languishing in poverty from this bondage which we now make bold to build. 379 There have been times in human history when a short signature by a mortal hand could build or demolish empires, or send nations at war with one another. Today, a signature by a humble hand obedient to a million silent aspirations will give the to iling Filipino farmer his liberation from poverty and social degradation. Thus, we are gathered here not merely to observe a transitory ceremony; we are engaged in the for midable act of re-making history. We are presiding over the dismantlement of an in stitution that has plagued our land for longer than four and a half centuries. We are celebrating the in itial step that will burst us under the for ces and the in stitutions that have kept our tenants in silent bondage over a period of time that extends to long before the Spaniards came to our shores. We are returning to our to iling farmer the freedom that is his by God’s grace, the dignity and security that come with the possession of his own land, and the natural right to enjoy the rewards of his own labors. We are launching the boldest program of land reform ever at tempted in our country which shall bring redemption to the economic slaves tilling our farms. In a few minutes, we shall sign an enactment of Congress proposed by us into law. But we are signing more than an or dinary code. We are signing a veritable proclamation of in dependence, a declaration of faith, a declaration of determination. By this we proclaim the in dependence of the shackled Filipino farmer, declare our faith in his ability to fulfill the responsibility that comes with his newly won freedom, and declare our determination to assist him effectively in rising to the proud status of an owner of his land and the equal in human dignity of any other citizen of the land. This occasion is the culmination of more than four hundred and fifty years of history of tenancy in the Philippines. It was mostly a melancholy history; at times, it was a turbulent history. It was a continuous history of share-cropping and debt-peonage that bore down on the shoulders of the tenant, whether it be the mamamahay of pre-Hispanic times or the kasamahan farmer who emerged in the eighteenth century or the share tenant of the twentieth century. Some of the old Spanish governors-general tried to alleviate the plight of the mamamahay, but their at tempts took the form of laws that were not honored in practice. In the eighteenth century Jose Basco y Vargas made another at tempt at liberating the tenant from his servitude by prohibiting practice of kasamahan, except in the case of landlords who had some legitimate reasons for absenteeism; such as sickness or old age. All through the American occupation of the Philippines and all through the Commonwealth period the problem of the tenant was a profound concern. Some advocates of reform sought the way of violent uprisings, strikes, or similar massive actions by tenants against landlords: Benigno Ramos led his Sakdals, and Pedro Abad Santos, his Socialists. Others, resorting to the methods of law, pushed the passage of measures to improve the lot of the tenants by in creasing his share of the crop or by giving him tenure or by resettling him on friar or public lands. President Manuel Quezon announced and tried to pursue a program of social justice in an effort to pioneer in land reform. 380 In 1946, after the war and after the transfer of political sovereignty back to the Philippines, another tenancy law, Republic Act 34, was passed"

President Manuel Quezon announced and tried to pursue a program of social justice in an effort to pioneer in land reform. 380 In 1946, after the war and after the transfer of political sovereignty back to the Philippines, another tenancy law, Republic Act 34, was passed. Again it regulated sharing arrangements, protected the tenant from undue eviction, and defined the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords within a system of share-tenancy. Still another at tempt at land reform, and the boldest one before this new law, was taken by President Ramon Magsaysay. Under his administration Congress passed Republic Act 1400 in 1955. It was salutary in its in tentions, but—in spite of its ambition—it suffered from the weaknesses of its predecessors: it at tacked the tenancy system on the surface, not at the roots. The evidence of the failure of past in tentions are all around us. Today we have more share- tenants than ever before. The trend is firmly established and shows no signs of levelling off, unless fundamental measures are implemented. Even in resettlement projects which have for their entire objective the establishment of farmer-operators tilling their own farms, the corrosive for ces of share-tenancy have penetrated and are spreading rapidly. This trend cannot be stopped except by bold and for thright action. We cannot cure a grave disease by simple palliatives. We cannot remove a growing social tumor by treating its surface. We can remove it only by a quick surgery. The failure of past at tempts at land reform was always a failure of determination: they tried to alleviate the pains, the evils, the in justices of the share- tenancy system, rather than resolutely at tacking the system itself. The result is that while some of the edges of the problem have been treated with some success, the disease remains as for midable and as threatening as ever. It is thus not enough to deal with the bits and pieces of the problem. It is not sufficient simply to enlarge the tenant’s share of the crop, or to give him stability of tenure, or to outlaw usury, or to provide alternative sources of credit, for the basic disorder remains. All the problems that plague the share-tenant—the death of his in itiative, his vulnerability to usury, his weak bargaining position before the landlord and trader, his poverty—all these have one root cause, namely, the very in stitution of share of share-tenancy itself. This is the very disease that must be removed, decisively and with determination. Today, with a few strokes of the pen, we shall perform the in itial step in this surgery. This document before us, a bill which in a few minutes will become a statute to be known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, will provide us with the legal powers to remove once and for all the system of share-tenancy that has plagued our agricultural countryside. In one statement it declares share tenancy as violative of the law of the land, a system which will be abolished and will no longer be to lerated by law. But the Code does not only provide us with the powers to remove an or ganic disease from our agricultural society; it also provides the means of in jecting new health, new vigor, new muscles, and new strength into the new social or der that will arise. Its first and immediate step is to destroy an oppressive and in to lerable system; its ensuing objectives—which will constitute the sinews of land reform—is to nurse our agricultural economy into a state of healthy productivity. It not only aims to turn the Filipino tenant into a free man; it aims, most of all, to turn him into a more productive farmer. 381 Thus, after centuries of silent struggle and angry protests, the Filipino tenant finds in this movement his victory, finds in this pen a powerful scythe with which to harvest the fruits of a proud and productive future, finds in this gathering the jubilant witnesses of his triumph, finds on this stage a rampart from which to view the wide and spacious fields in the country which shall be his to till, to work, to cultivate, and to love as his own. This moment is only an in itial triumph in that the law has torn down his prison. His task from hereon is to build: to build his own technical capabilities, to cultivate his farm efficiently and scientifically; his abilities to finance his operations in. an or derly manner, his ability to market his produce effectively, and to in vest the savings out of his in creased in comes in the further improvement of his own farm. Most of all, his task is to change himself, his outlook, his spirit, his at titude to wards work. Under the law he will cease to be a tenant; during a transitional period he will function as a leaseholder; and after a few years he will be a landowner. We call upon him to abandon his outlook as a tenant, and take on the vision of a new landowner. In this transition the Filipino farmer will need help. As a transitional leaseholder and as an eventual landowner he will need manifold assistance, in cluding technical, marketing, financial, and legal. The Land Reform Code provides the government with the resources and the machinery with which to give him all the help and support he needs. Among these are the Agricultural Productivity Commission which will extend to him technical assistance, the Agricultural Credit Administration which will give him operational financing and marketing assistance, the of fice of Agrarian Counsel which will provide him legal assistance, the Land Authority which will assist him to become the owner of the land he tills, and the Land Bank which will assist him to pay for the land that has become his own"

Under the Land Reform Program, the farmer will the refore have behind him a for midable battery of government agencies to in sure that his transformation from a tenant into a lessee and eventually into a landowner will result in in creased production from our farms, in in creased in comes for our farmers, in better management of the farmer’s financial affairs, and—most of all —in the enhancement of the dignity and the social position of those who now live under the burden of tenancy. Realizing that the implementation of the program is the crux to the realization of its noble objectives, we pledge all our power, all our fervor, and all our faculties to warrant the efficient operation of all these agencies in or der to in sure the rise of the poverty-enslaved tenant into a free and prosperous farmer. The machinery for carrying out the Land Reform Program will soon be in full operation. We shall see that the implementation of the program the reby will not be haphazard but systematic; will not be hasty but or derly; will not be reckless but resolute. It will be pursued in manageable stages, rather than as a breathless and one-shot effort that will sweep the nation overnight. It will be managed prudently and well, with all due respect to the rights of all parties concerned. In abolishing tenancy and launching a decisive and bold land reform program, we confront a huge and monumental task. We dare say that it matches the historic proportions of no other 382 achievement of our nation in the past, save the Philippine Revolution that began in 1896. Indeed, the Land Reform Program is a revolution in itself, part of the peaceful, ambitious, unfinished revolution which we are now waging to win for our people an adequate measure of prosperity and well-being. Land reform is not a separate and isolated program; it is a component, and a very crucial component, of our wide-ranging and in tegrated program to promote the rapid and sound social and economic development of our country. Land Reform will release the hitherto suppressed productive energies of our farmers, and will thus in crease the capacity of our agricultural sector to provide our people with food and our in dustries with raw materials. Land reform will in crease the in comes of our agricultural society, and will thus convert it into a large market for the produce of our in dustries. Land reform is not solely a program to help tenants; it is a program to uplift the whole nation, socially and economically. It is ultimately a proof and demonstration of the respect which our nation holds for the dignity and the rights which are at tached in separably to the human person. It is meet to recall at this point that the Filipino has been associated with apathy and resistance to progress. Our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, has referred to this seeing trait as the in dolence of the Filipino which must be overcome. For centuries, the Filipino tilling our farms seemed in dolent because his creative and constructive qualities were overpowered and stifled by a sense of hopelessness as he languished in the dark prison of his unending poverty and misery. Since life was to him hopeless for advancement, his supreme ambition and recourse for human joy was to spend the occasional windfalls from his lengthening debt in or der to drown his sorrows in tuba and basi or in a bet at a cockfight. This sense of hopelessness was a drug that kept him in dolent and lukewarm to the charms of progress. Through this land reform program, which releases the tenants from endless darkness to the sunshine of new hopes, we can look for ward to the day when the so-called in dolent Filipino, after centuries, shall be no more, and in his place will arise a Filipino who shall work hard because he has a better life to work and hope for, who shall actively take part in community work that builds the nation because he has the dignity that makes him the equal of all his countrymen, who shall fight for his rights and do his duties because he has effective freedom for the discharge of this responsibility, and who, in the hour of necessity, will be happy to give even his life for his country because in his country he has land to call his own. The Filipino farmer has waited century after century for this very moment and this very occasion. In a moment, as the elected President of this Republic, I shall sign the Agricultural Land Reform Code into a law of the land. By this act the nation shall put its in delible seal on this proclamation of the to iling farmer’s liberation and his victory. So let this signing be recorded in our annals as an Act of Emancipation of the to iling farmer from his slavery to debt, poverty, and misery and of his dignification as a human being and as a citizen. By this act of emancipation, a new revolution is on. In fulfillment of the dream of centuries and in answer to the cry for liberation of the slaved Filipino tenant in our farms from his chains of want and misery, it is now my cherished privilege 383 and in finite honor to sign the Agricultural Land Reform Code into law as Republic Act No. 3844 on this memorable day of the Common Man. 384 TOPIC 10: 1972-1986 List of Reading Materials: 1. 1973 Constitution 2.

Report of His Excellency President Marcos to the Batasang Pambansa 9. June 1981 Marcos Speech 10. True Filipino Ideology 385 The Postwar Philippines 1972-2011 This section is divided into two periods namely, from 1972 to 1986 (Fourth Republic) and 1986 to the present (Fifth Republic). The first part spans the gamut of political, economic and military issues from the martial law and constitution to agrarian reform and amendments to the military bases agreement. To address these issues, it is deemed necessary to retrieve various types of primary sources ranging from the proclamations and presidential decrees and speeches to Philippine Constitution. Proclamation No. 1081 dealt with the proclamation of a state of martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, whereas Proclamation No. 2045 had to do with the announcement of the lifting of martial law on June 17, 1981. In consonance with his administration’s agrarian reform program, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 2, s. 1972 and Presidential Decree No. 27, s. 1972. Pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 2, s. 1972, the “entire country” was “proclaimed” as a “land reform area.” On the other hand, Presidential Decree No. 27, s. 1972 stipulated the “emancipation of tenant from the bondage of soil” by “transferring to them the ownership of the land they till.” On December 1, 1972, the 1971 Constitutional Convention transmitted a copy of the Constitution to President Marcos. By virtue of Proclamation No. 1102, s. 1973, President Marcos announced the effectivity of the Constitution framed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Consisting of a Preamble and 17 articles, the 1973 Constitution provided for a parliamentary form of government with a unicameral National Assembly. In his Report to the Batasang Pambansa (1984), President Marcos proudly presented the Amendments to the Military Bases Agreement, which was concluded with the United States on March 14, 1947. In his address before the delegates to the local aid review conferences on July 25, 1984, President Marcos discussed the development strategies adopted by his government to drive the domestic economy in the 1970 s and 1980 s. In his speech on June 18, 1981, President Marcos propounded his vision of “New Filipinism.” In an essay entitled True Filipino Ideology, the president spoke of an “emergent national ideology.” Dealing with the political, economic and national security matters, the second part encompasses such primary sources as the speeches of the Presidents of the Fifth Republic, constitution, presidential proclamation and Republic Act, and an of ficial statement. With the signing of Proclamation no. 3 on March 25, 1986 by President Corazon Aquino, a Provisional Constitution, also called Freedom Constitution, was promulgated. Consisting of a Preamble and eighteen (18) sections, the 1987 Philippine Constitution prescribed a presidential system of government whose powers are distributed among three co-equal branches and a bicameral legislature. President Aquino’s commitment to “social justice” and “sound rural development” was evidenced by the signing of Republic Act no. 6657, An Act Instituting a Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program to Promote Social Justice and Industrialization, Providing the Mechanism for its Implementation, and For Other Purposes, also known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988. President Fidel Ramos articulated his vision for the Philippines in his Second State of the Nation Address (1993). Addressing the delegates to the 20 th Philippine Business Conference of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 386 President Ramos welcomed the ratification of the URUGUAY ROUND of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), President Ramos expressed his conviction that the country would stand to benefit from the trade agreement. President Joseph Estrada vowed to promote the welfare of the masses in his Inaugural Address on June 30, 1998. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo identified the “four core beliefs” of her administration in her Inaugural Address on January 20, 2001. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s resolve to serve the Filipino people was expressed in his Inaugural Address on June 30, 2016. In his pre-recorded address before the General Debate of the virtual 75 th United Nations (UN) General Assembly on September 23, 2020 (Manila time), President Duterte asserted the 2016 Hague Tribunal’s ruling on the South China Sea. 387 1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines The full text of the 1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines is available at https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of- the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/ As mandated by Republic Act No. 1632, otherwise known as “\"The 1971 Constitutional Convention Act,” which was ratified by the Congress on August 24, 1970, the 1971 Constitutional Convention, which was presided over in itially by for mer President Carlos P.

Marcos went on to say that in the 1980 s, the government, in the face of the stark in ternational economic developments and dismal economic performance of the country at the end of the 1970 s, the government carried out a four-year “medium-term plan” that was anchored on a “five-point recovery program.” The president pointed out that the government had shifted to “small- scale, labor-in tensive, and for eign-exchange-saving or earning projects.” He made 420 it clear that as the government continued to foster “in ternational cooperation,” it would still gave importance to “national in terest.” I would like to express the Philippine government’s deep appreciation to the delegates on this second and last day of the local aid review conference, especially our good friends from our donor countries and in ternational in stitutions. Our thanks also to the Asian Development Bank for the valuable assistance it extended to the national economic and development authority in the or ganization of this meeting. Your meeting in deed comes at a crucial time in our nation’s history when we are in the midst of grappling with a financial crisis that continues to put a heavy strain on our development efforts. As we look back to the past, we note that the last decade (1972-82) was a period of significant changes in the Philippines, a middle-in come oil-importing country with a present population of 53.4 million. Growing at the rate of 5.5 percent in real terms over the past 11 years, the Philippines has a per capita GNP of $650 in current terms as of end-1983. Agriculture accounted for roughly 25 percent and in dustry about 36 percent of the gross national product that year as against 29 percent and 31 percent respectively, in 1972. The Philippines’ economic performance during the past decade is the result of a development strategy that was characterized by continued high rate of public in vestment; supportive fiscal and monetary policy; and substantial capital in flows to fund development requirements. These policies were pursued to partly overcome the two major oil shocks in 1973-74 and 1979-80. Consistent with the long-term growth strategy and in response to several debilitating effects of the first oil crisis, we embarked on a number of important measures. An aggressive energy development program was launched in 1973, which reduced oil import dependence from 95 percent in 1972 to 65 percent in 1983. Export development was strengthened and collection of domestic revenues and exports provided the leverage to gain access to for eign borrowings, particularly during the mid-1970 s. During the period 1973-82, the country was granted medium and long term loans averaging to some $1.5 billion per year. At the same time, Philippine availment of of ficial development assistance also grew substantially amounting to a to tal of US$6 billion ODA loans outstanding as of end-December 1983. The proportion of ODA loans to to tal non-monetary external debts in creased from 19.6 percent in 1973 to 30 percent in 1983, reflecting the growing contribution of ODA to the overall development program of the country. These for eign borrowings substantially augmented our domestic resources, and these were utilized to finance major development programs in an effort to meet the in creasing demand of the population for basic services and livelihood opportunities. During the decade 1972-1982, the government spent some P 62 billion in such people-or iented development programs as: (1) energy self-reliance (23.5%); (2) education (21.5%); (3) water resources (11.3%) food self-sufficiency (14.4%); (5) transport and communications (15.8%); (6) health (6.2%); (7) livelihood and housing (5%); and (8) agrarian reform (2.3%). These expenditures, designed for the economic and social uplift of the poorest among our people, were 421 more than 10 times the development expenditures for 1962-71. While government spending was clearly expansionary, the budgetary deficit to GNP ratio was carefully controlled at less than 2 percent until 1980, in creasing only to 4.3 percent by 1982. This development strategy was successful until the late 1970 s, by which time the economy had been growing by about six and a half percent, much faster than in the late 1960 s. After 1979, however, real GNP declined progressively from 4.4 percent in 1980 to 1.4 percent in 1983, the lowest growth since the country’s in dependence in 1946. The decline can be at tributed to two factors: the second oil shock in 1979 and the consequent prolonged recession and the failure of some past in vestments to yield expected targets. After the second oil shock and the on set of a world recession, major debtor developing countries like the Philippines found it more difficult to earn for eign exchange from exports because of the in ternational recession. At the same time, restrictive monetary policies abroad to contain in flation caused a steep rise in in ternational in terest rates and heavier debt service burdens for borrowing countries. The Philippines’ already sizable level of external debt and the decline in export receipt precluded the sustenance in growth targets in the 1980 s. To redress our present economic difficulties we are now pursuing a medium-term plan that is built around a five-point recovery program. This four-year plan is basically designed to stem the balance of payment crisis, in crease self-reliance and national productivity and bring about meaningful structural changes in the Philippine economy"

      "context": ". After 1979, however, real GNP declined progressively from 4.4 percent in 1980 to 1.4 percent in 1983, the lowest growth since the country’s in dependence in 1946. The decline can be at tributed to two factors: the second oil shock in 1979 and the consequent prolonged recession and the failure of some past in vestments to yield expected targets. After the second oil shock and the on set of a world recession, major debtor developing countries like the Philippines found it more difficult to earn for eign exchange from exports because of the in ternational recession. At the same time, restrictive monetary policies abroad to contain in flation caused a steep rise in in ternational in terest rates and heavier debt service burdens for borrowing countries. The Philippines’ already sizable level of external debt and the decline in export receipt precluded the sustenance in growth targets in the 1980 s. To redress our present economic difficulties we are now pursuing a medium-term plan that is built around a five-point recovery program. This four-year plan is basically designed to stem the balance of payment crisis, in crease self-reliance and national productivity and bring about meaningful structural changes in the Philippine economy. We are now negotiating a financial package with the International Monetary Fund, a consortium of about 500 creditor banks and of ficial sources of capital, most of whom, I understand are represented here to day. This financial package will consist of an IMF standby credit, rescheduling of part of the country’s for eign debt, maintenance of trade-related credit facilities at least at the level of October 1983, and particularly with your generous support on new of ficial development assistance loans. This is expected to improve our BOP position and to maintain the in flow of essential imports. We are also taking measures to stimulate domestic resource generation through a combination of demand management policies designed to restrain imports, strengthen export in centives, and minimize in flation. A floating exchange rate was adopted as of 6 June 1984 to control the current account deficit. At the same time, the national government has adopted a revenue and expenditure program to keep the fiscal deficit to not more than 1.2 percent of GNP up to 1987. In keeping with the stabilization program, credit expansion will be stringently controlled to minimize in flationary pressures. In tandem with shorter-term stabilization measures, development activities have been reoriented in favor of on-going, small-scale, labor-in tensive, and for eign-exchange-saving or earning projects. A larger share of in vestments will be allocated to productivity programs for livelihood provision and self-employment. Natural resources will be developed to complement priority programs in food production, energy, exports, and social services. In contrast to the large-scale capital in tensive programs of the late 1970 s, these small-scale in vestments are addressed 422 specifically to problems of resource scarcity and possible worker displacement, particularly during the period of adjustment. We have, moreover, adopted a development strategy that emphasizes the modernization of agriculture. Through agricultural productivity programs, it is envisioned that the country’s current dependence on for eign borrowings will be reduced by in creased export earnings from agro-based activities and the boost to domestic savings generated by higher rural in comes. The development of for ests, aquatic resources, and mineral-based activities, on the one hand, will be complemented by cottage, small and medium scale, labor-in tensive in dustries, on the other. As an immediate step to generate more livelihood activities, jobs, food supply, for eign exchange receipts and to meet the other needs of our people and in dustries, productivity and rehabilitation programs will be implemented. These programs in clude the massive planting of hybrid corn, in tensified rice production, aquaculture development assistance to the copper in dustry and other mineral sectors, expanded production of non-traditional exports such as electronic products and garments, and commercialization of technological breakthroughs for producing food and raw materials on a commercial scale such as rattan, root crops, and other products. To make the productive system more efficient, in ternationally competitive, and able to generate more productive employment, phased trade liberalization and tariff reforms began in 1980 will continue to be implemented. In line with the new priorities, structural adjustment will be expanded to in clude the agriculture sector. The program will cover more efficient pricing and marketing, in stitutional and other in centives. These are expected to in crease the labor absorptive capacity, for eign exchange generation, and relative profitability of agro-based in dustries. To support the structural adjustment program, key in dustries will be revitalized. Nonconventional and rural-based sources of energy will be developed, and exportation of goods and services will be encouraged according to the country’s comparative advantage. These will be complemented by to urism promotion and in creased collaboration with other countries on mutually profitable ventures, to maximize for eign exchange earnings. We recognize that over the short-term, economic stabilization measures are expected to put pressure on the unemployment situation. This will be addressed through a package of adjustment assistance for workers and their families suffering from economic stress, such as prudent wage adjustments, staggered working hours to prevent mass layoffs, separation pay for laid-off workers, advance payment of vacation and sick leave benefits, and unemployment assistance loans. Short-term skills training tailored to the needs of potential growth in dustries shall also be given to facilitate re-entry of laid-off workers into the labor market. The Philippine government adheres to a policy of helping to advance in ternational cooperation while at the same time pursuing the national in terest. It is in this light that we have embarked on a financial and economic program to make our domestic economy more self-reliant, able to respond better to external shocks, and able to fulfill its economic obligations to the rest of the world. 423 Beyond national in itiatives, however, a broadly based world economic recovery is contingent on actions taken by the developed countries. Firstly, we welcome policies conducive to lower in ternational in terest rates, in or der to sustain in vestments and reduce debt servicing cost. Secondly, we encourage the continuation of capital in flows from both commercial and of ficial development sources, in cluding in itiatives to extend multi-year rescheduling of external debts where debtor countries show serious adjustment efforts.

In particular, we hope these agencies will look favorably at programs and projects directly supportive of agricultural and rural development and other support services aimed at raising agricultural productivity and benefiting the majority of the Filipinos who continued to rely on agriculture for their livelihood.

On October 21, 1972, President Marcos promulgated the second presidential decree that dealt with the question of land reform. Stipulating the “emancipation of all tenant farmers and transfer of the land they till,” this decree spelled out the fine points of the administration’s land reform program. President Marcos prefaced the decree by recognizing the compelling necessity to address the in justices arising from land ownership, which was a bedrock of the New Society. In terms of scope, the decree limited the coverage of the program to “tenanted” rice and corn land and pegged the retention limit at a maximum of seven hectares. The decree further mandated the purchase of the landholdings that exceeded seven hectares by the government for distribution and sale to the tenants who were to pay the to tal cost of the land over a period of 15 years. Inasmuch as the old concept of the land ownership by a few has spawned valid and legitimate grievances that gave rise to violent conflict and social tension, 427 The redness of such legitimate grievances being one of the fundamental objectives of the New Society, Since Reformation must start with emancipation of the tiller bondage, NOW, THEREFORE, I FERDINAND E.

Here is what the Supreme Court said in its decision promulgated on December 11, 1971: ” x x x our jurisprudence at tests abundantly to the Communist activities in the Philippines, especially in Manila, from the late twenties to the early thirties, then aimed principally at in citement to sedition or rebellion, as the immediate objective. Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, the movement seemed to have waned notably; but, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific and the miseries, the devastation and havoc, and the proliferation of unlicensed firearms concomitant with the military occupation of the Philippines and its subsequent liberation, brought about, in the late for ties. a resurgence of the Communist threat, with such vigor as to be able to or ganize and operate in Central Luzon an army -called HUKBALAHAP, during the occupation, and renamed Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB) after liberation- which clashed several times with the armed for ces of the Republic. This prompted then President Quirino to issue Proclamation No.210, dated October 22, 1950, sus- pending the privilege of the writ of habeas Corpus, the validity of which was upheld in Montenegro v. Castañeda. Days before the promulgation of said Proclamation, or on October 18, 1950, members of the Communist Politburo in the Philippines were apprehended in Manila. Subsequently accused and convicted of the crime of rebellion, they served their respective sentences. “The fifties saw a comparative lull in Communist acti- vities, in sofar as peace and or der were concerned. Still, on June 20, 1957, Republic Act No.1700, otherwise known as the Anti- Subversion Act, was approved, upon the grounds stated in the very preamble of said statute -that ” x x x the Communist Party of the Philippines, although purportedly apolitical party, is in fact an or ganized conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, not only by force and violence but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means, for the purpose of establishing in the Philippines a to talitarian regime subject to alien domination and control; ” x x x the continued existence and activities of the Communist Party of the Philippines constitutes a clear, present and grave danger to the security of the Philippines; and ” x x x in the fact of the or ganized, systematic and persistent subversion, national in scope but in ternational in direction, posed by the Communist …Party of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent need for special legislation to cope with this continuing menace to the freedom and security of the country x x x.”: “In the language of the Report on Central Luzon, submitted, on September 4, 1971, by the Senate Ad Hoc Committee of Seven-copy of which Report was filed in these cases by the petitioners herein- 433 “The years following 1963 saw the successive emergence in the country of several mass or ganizations, notably the Lapiang Manggagawa (now the Socialist Party of the Philippines) among the workers; the Malayang Samahan ng Mga Magsasaka (MASAKA) among the peasantry; the Kabataang Makabayan (KM) among the youth/students; and the Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN) among the in tellectuals/professionals, the PKP has exerted all-out effort to in filtrate, in fluence and utilize these or ganizations in promoting its radical brand of nationalism.” “Meanwhile, the Communist leaders in the Philippines had been split into two (2) groups, one of which -com- posed mainly of young radicals, constituting the Maoist faction -reorganized the Communist Party of the Philip- pines early in 1969 and established a New People’s Army. This faction adheres to the Maoist concept of the ‘Protracted People’s War’ or ‘War of National Liberation.’ Its ‘Programme for a People’s Democratic Revolution’ states, in ter alia: “The Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to implement its general programme for a people’s democratic revolution. All Filipino communists are ready to sacrifice their lives for the worthy cause of achieving the new type of democracy, of building a new Philippines that is genuinely and completely in dependent, democratic, united, just and prosperous... “The Central task of any revolutionary movement is to seize political power. The Communist Party of the Philippines assumes this task at a time that both the in ternational and national situations are favorable to taking the road of armed revolution…’ “In the year 1969, the NPA had-according to the records of the Department of National Defense- conducted raids, resorted to kidnappings and taken part in other violent in cidents numbering over 230, in which it in flicted 404 casualties, and, in turn, suffered 243 losses. In 1970, its record of violent in cidents was about the same, but the NPA casualties more than doubled. “At any rate, two (2) facts are undeniable: (a) all Communists, whether they belong to the traditional group or to the Maoist faction, believe that force and violence are in dispensable to the at tainment of their main and ultimate objective, and act in accordance with such belief, although they disagree on the means to be used at a given time and in a particular place; and (b) there is a New People’s Army, other, of course, than the armed for ces of the Republic and antagonistic the reto. Such New People’s Army is per se proof of the existence of a rebellion, especially considering that its establishment was announced publicly by the reorganized CPP. Such announcement is in the nature of a public challenge to the duly constituted authorities and may be likened to a declaration of war, sufficient to establish a war status or a condition of belligerency, even before the actual commencement of hostilities"

Land reform, which has liberated 523,153 farmers from the shackles of tenancy and transformed land ownership from a system of exploitation to a self-reliant and creative act, so that the in come of the Filipino farmer has in creased twofold in some areas, threefold in others, a condition altogether different from the times when land reform legislation repeatedly failed because Congress was controlled by landowners, giving rise to the Hukbalahap uprising. The land reform decree in one sweep eradicated the centuries-old condition of the typical Filipino farmer which virtually imprisoned him in in debtedness handed down from one generation to another and converted him from a mendicant to a self-assured and dignified in dividual. Part of this new life granted to the farmer was the capability granted to him for self- reliance, liberating him from the tentacles of usurious landlords by limiting payments for the land allotted him by the latter to a part of the harvest. The New Society also extended the newly liberated farmer credit with out collateral and gave him irrigation, farm-to-market roads, the assistance of technologists, subsidized fertilizer and pesticides, a guaranteed and established 446 minimum level of price for rice and other cereals under the National Grains Authority (now the National Food Authority), a policy responsive to changes in the economic situation. 2. Political reform, in cluding a reorganization of the government, which has retrieved from the ancient past the Filipino concept of the barangay as the basic unit of community development and political action; set up the Tanodbayan and the Sandiganbayan as the people’s in strument against corruption in government reorganized the prosecution service, and, through the Batasang Pambansa, is now in the process of reorganizing the judiciary; elevated the quality of the civil service through professionalization, training and better in centives to excellence in the form of in creased salaries and improved working conditions. Reflecting the spirit of reform was the passage of the new Constitution by a convention that opened in 1970, its ratification at barangay assemblies on January 17, 1973, its weathering of close scrutiny by the Supreme Court which declared in its decision of Javellana vs. The Executive Secretary (50 SCRA 141) that “there is no further judicial obstacle to the new Constitution being considered in force and effect,” and its further for mal ratification on July 27, 1973, by free and secret ballot in a plebiscite conducted under the control and supervision of the Commission on Elections. The Constitution, although passed and ratified after the promulgation of martial law, contained principles of government which were conceived and approved by the constitutional convention before Proclamation No. 1081 was issued. Among these basic tenets which preceded the declaration of martial law was the parliamentary system into whose full implementation the government is now moving. The new Constitution authenticated several expressions of popular will which followed its ratification, in cluding referenda and plebiscites (July 27, 1973; February 27, 1975; October 16, 1976; December 17, 1977) conducted to determine whether the people wanted the in cumbent President to continue in his position, and whether or not the in cumbent President should, in accordance with Amendment No"

Economic reform, which has enabled the nation to maintain the momentum of growth at an average of 6 to 7 per cent form 1970 to 1980, a period wracked by repeated crises mostly generated by external factors, in contrast to the comparatively placid and prosperous decade of the ’60 s when the growth rate was below 5 per cent; converted the Philippines from a rice- deficient country (its last importation, in 1974, was $500 million) to a rice-exporting country; enabled the nation to diversify its exports, from the four traditional items (consisting of sugar, coconut products, wood products and mineral ores which to gether comprised 80 per cent of our exports before 1966 and now constitute only 45 per cent) to a broad new range of products, in cluding electronic items, semi-processed food and raw materials, garments, and cottage in dustry products; developed an accelerated energy program whose scope and robustness have been acknowledged by most member-countries of the United Nations as well as by recognized experts and scientists; undertaken a vigorous electrification program which has in creased the number of rural households with access to electricity from 76,000 in 1972 to more than a million in 1980; in sum, produced these economic in dicators — a) The Gross National Product in creased from P 55,526,000 in 1972 to P 192,911,000 in 1979 at constant prices or P 269,781,000 at current prices; b) The budget has in creased from P 5 billion in 1972 to P 55 billion in 1981, governmental capital expenditures from a mere P 0.9 billion in 1972 to P 14.9 billion in 1979; c) Collections of government from taxes have in creased from P 5.1 billion in 1972 to P 36.6 billion in 1980; d) Per capita in come has more than trebled from US$214 in 1972 to US$755 in 1979 — in 1972 the percentage of Filipino families with a family in come of P 1999 and below was 24.3 per cent while in 1979 it was reduced to 11.2 per cent, and those with family in comes of P 30,000 or over in creased from 5.0 per cent in 1972 to 12.8 per cent in 1979; 448 e) Total exports in creased from US$1.106 billion in 1972 to US$5.935 billion in 1980; f) Showing the stability of our currency, notwithstanding the fluctuations of the dollar, the rate of exchange of the peso to the US dollar has barely moved from the 1972 rate of 6.6710 to the 1979 rare of 7.3775; g) Savings and time deposits in creased from P 5.402 billion in 1972 to P 49.116 billion as of September 1980; h) Effective minimum wage in creased from P 4.75 daily in 1972 to P 23.30 – P 24.70 in 1980; i) Gross domestic in vestment in creased from P 11,573 million in 1972 to P 78,198 million in 1980, while gross national savings in creased from P 11,679 million in 1972 to P 62,395 million in 1980; j) The debt service ratio has been reduced from 20 per cent of for eign exchange earnings in 1972 to 18.7 per cent of for eign exchange earnings in 1980; k) The in ternational reserves were in creased from US$282 million in 1972 to US$3.1 billion in 1980; l) The in flation rate has been contained at less than 15 per cent, which is very much below the in flation rates of most countries, which range from 20 per cent to 25 per cent; The economy gained in calculable benefits from the road building program, which has built 65,972 kilometers of highways from 1969 to 1980, compared to the 84,722 kilometers built between 1900 and 1965, as well as from the accelerated program of irrigation, which has produced irrigation systems for more than 1,300,000 hectares as of 1980, in contrast to the systems built from 1900 to 1972, which could serve no more than 600 thousand hectares. Under the New Society, for eign loans have been rationalized. Short-term loans, which comprised 90 per cent of for eign borrowings under the previous administration, were converted to long- term loans. These for eign loans are not made to support or dinary or current expenditures, in stead are utilized exclusively for capital expenditures aimed at productive enterprise. They are the refore self-amortizing and self-regenerating. Before the administration of the in cumbent President, the credit standing of the Philippines was notoriously low, so much so that the World Bank was not willing to lend more than $40 million a year. During the present administration, the Philippines has become so dependable as a borrower that the World Bank has been willing to lend $500 million at any single time, in dicating the competence and stability of the Philippine government, which has never been delinquent in its payments. In the previous administration the government could hardly borrow any amount in view of its in efficient handling of borrowed funds, lack of coordinated economic planning, and 449 the hazy policies of leadership. Aggravating the situation were government threats of confiscation of private enterprise. We have in creased the direct taxes. Before 1965, only 1.5 million tax payers filed in come tax returns; in 1980, 5 million tax payers filed returns. The corporate tax was also in creased by 5 per cent to 40 per cent.

We have set up the Kadiwa Centers of the Human Settlements ministry and the National Grains Authority to bring down prices even more. A massive food production and supply system has been established under a new corporation, the National Food Authority, to which the NGA has been converted with a capitalization of P 5 billion. Underlying the economy is the basic policy to uphold private enterprise. We have never confiscated or nationalized private enterprise, and there is absolutely no in tention to take this socialist course. The previous administration threatened to do so, that is why in vestments before the present administration were discouraged from entering the Philippines. The situation created by the threat of the past administration to confiscate or nationalize private enterprise was corrected with the or ganization of the National Economic and Development Authority and the Board of Investments. Martial law provided the opportunity to in stall the requisite in stitutions for coping with the energy crisis now and in the future, starting with the for mulation of a comprehensive, long-term program which has been singled out by the World Bank as a suggested model for Third World countries. The program in cludes the mobilization and recruitment of the critical manpower to undertake the various activities of energy exploration and development which made possible commercial oil production for the first time in 1979 and made the Philippines the second largest developer of geothermal energy by 1980; fuel processing and refining, planning and construction of the energy delivery logistics, power generation and transmission in frastructure, as well as research and development and diffusion of alternative energy forms and technologists to cover fossil fuels, biomass, energy farms, wind, wave, tidal and solar power, all the way to more energy-efficient devices, machines and appliances that should spawn rural energy systems. The ultimate objective of our economic policy is a balanced agro-in dustrial economy. This is why we are shifting slowly to the 11 principal in dustries which are needed for the fulfillment of 450 this objectives. We can the refore hope that in time we shall cease completely to import factories and heavy machinery and will in stead engineer and fabricate them. We are even now in the process of gradually manufacturing automobile, heavy truck and diesel engines. These 11 basic in dustries are in the process of being set up; copper smelter, phosphate fertilizer, aluminum smelter, heavy equipment in dustries, in tegrated steel mills, petrochemical complex, diesel engine manufacturing, cement in dustry expansion, coconut in dustry rationalization, alcogas, and in tegrated pulp and paper. 5. The program for peace and or der, which has eliminated the private armies of the Old Society, immobilized such lawless elements as the Light-a-Fire Movement, the April 6 Movement, and the Partido Nagkaisang Sosyalistang Demokrata ng Pilipinas, or SOCDEM; or ganized self- defense units in barangays to protect them, on a self-reliant basis, from criminal elements; and developed the PC-Integrated National Police as an effective professionalized force capable of maintaining peace and or der, with the possible support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in case this becomes necessary because of actual combat. The vigorous and unrelenting quality of the peace and or der campaign enabled the government to identify 250 criminal syndicates and apprehend or neutralize their members; to seize or collect 650,000 firearms of all classes, makes and varieties, in cluding artillery, machine guns, assault rifles, tanks, armored cars, and the latest models of sophisticated armaments; to arrest and bring to trial more than 2,000 or dinary criminals long wanted under unserved warrants. Both factions of a subversive or ganization were similarly dealt a heavy blow, one faction surrendering en masse to the President before and after the proclamation of martial law, and the entire leadership of the other faction being arrested and detained to face trial. Following negotiations led by the First Lady, Minister Imelda R. Marcos, with the President of Libya, Col. Khaddafi, and the Quadrapartite Committee of the Islamic Conference, a settlement of the secessionist movement in the South was finally reached with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), represented by its Chairman, Nur Misuari, who signed with our own representatives the Tripoli Agreement in Libya on December 23, 1976. The agreement provided for the or ganization of autonomous regions where Muslims reside, and for a ceasefire agreement, of which two were in fact signed, one in Tripoli also on December 23, 1976 and another in Zamboanga City on January 20, 1977, between Admiral Romeo Espaldon of the Southern Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Dr. Tham Manjoorsa, authorized representative of the MNLF. A subsequent plebiscite led to the creation of two autonomous regions, Regions IX and XII, in Mindanao, where elections were held to choose the members of their respective regional assemblies or Sangguniang Pampook and members of their respective Executive Councils or Lupong Tagapagpaganap were appointed from those recommended by the said regional assemblies. 6"

Educational reform, which has succeeded in reorienting the curriculum to the requirements of economic development, placing emphasis on vocational and technological skills in high school 451 and science and engineering in college; provided a suitable at mosphere for the promotion of science and research, as shown in the studies and experiments conducted by the International Rice Research Institute, the new Institute of Plant Breeding, the recently or ganized Institute of Microbiology which seeks to employ the new science of recombinant DNA, and the Southeast Asia Fisheries Development Council (SEAFDEC), which has done in tensive work for the full development of the country’s fisheries potential, in cluding the launching of “blue farming” or farming of the seas. Greater support has also been given for the Science High School, and scholarships are being set up for science and engineering to promote the in volvement of more talented Filipinos in these fields. 7. Reform in the social services, which has produced remarkable advances in nutrition, health and family planning. With respect to nutrition, we have developed in the space of less than three years a program on both the barangay and the national levels which has become a model for many countries, as the United Nations itself has acknowledge. At the core of this program is the day care center provided for in the Presidential Decree 1567 issued in 1978, which calls for the setting up of a day care center in every barangay with at least 100 residents. As of last year, 4,000 such day care centers have been established. In the field of social security and social in surance, administered for the benefit of the public servant and his family, substantial improvements have been made through Presidential Decree No. 1146, as amended, which expands, in creases and liberalizes social security and in surance benefits of government employees at a time when global economic conditions and realities have eroded the purchasing power of pensions. The pith of the government’s effort to provide social services is, however, the human settlements program which we commenced a few years ago and is now an acknowledged model for similar efforts in other countries. Into the human settlements program we have in troduced the principle, the first country to do so, that livelihood is essential to its success, and that housing units, through the most visible evidence of progress in the skyline in both town and country, are merely a part of the whole human settlements program. With livelihood as the core of this program, we are able to assure that the acquisition of a housing unit by a family is truly meaningful. To carry out this objective, we set up the source of livelihood in a human settlement or teach skills that would provide in come, and in this way enable the government to recover funds spent for housing and in frastructure and utilize these as self-regenerating funds for other human settlements. Much of the success of the human settlements program will depend on our full and continuing compliance with the rational land use policy that we have adopted. This policy contemplates Manila as the starting point from which would then proceed the building of satellite cities in the outlying areas to prevent urban sprawl and all its at tendant evils. The same policy commands us to maintain agricultural areas and desist from converting agricultural flat lands to housing and in dustrial sites. We are the refore now pushing for the establishment of housing and in dustrial sites on 18º slopes to wards hillsides so as to make more rational use of the limited land space. 452 Another important element of the rational land use policy is the limitation and eventual stoppage of the exportation of raw logs and conversion to the processing of wood products. As a consequence, we have successfully kept 45 per cent of our land area of 30 million hectares as for ests throughout the country. At the same time, we are even now slowly shifting from extensive to in tensive agriculture and blue farming, or farming of the oceans. Fundamental to all this is the recognition that we are principally a private enterprise society which knows the value of private in itiative but which at the same time has an egalitarian base, in asmuch as the New Society is basically a revolution of the poor. By adhering to this concept, we should be able to prevent the misuse of wealth, such as by brutalizing and degrading those who don’t have it. The importance of the private sector, the refore, cannot be over-emphasized. The private sector is the cutting edge, the most active element, of change. The in itiative of the private sector will thus be called upon in such crucial undertakings as zonification and the land use rationalization approved by the government.

Proclamation No. 2045, s. 1981: Proclaiming the Termination of the State of Martial law throughout the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos. Manila: Official Gazette of the Philippines, 1981. https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/1981/01/17/proclamation-no-2045- s-1981/. 455 Report of His Excellency Ferdinand E. Marcos President of the Philippines To the Batasang Pambansa Ferdinand Marcos This presidential report is accessible at Marcos, Ferdinand E. Presidential speeches, (V ol. 9). Manila: Office of the President of the Philippines, 1980. https://tinyurl. com/y 6 dgpf 5 w. Catapulted to the presidency in 1965, President Ferdinand Marcos secured a second term in 1969. By virtue of Proclamation No. 1081, President Marcos placed the country under martial law on September 21, 1972, following a spate of bombings in Metro Manila. Constitutional authoritarianism supplanted the democratic in stitutions. On February 25, 1986, after four days of bloodless EDSA People Power Revolution, Marcos was compelled to step down and flee with his family to Hawaii. In his report in 1980 to the Batasang Pambansa on the amendments to the Military Bases Agreement, which was for ged with the United States on March 14, 1947, President Marcos first noted that the “at tainment of sovereignty, the achievement of security, and full economic development and modernization,” which constituted the “objectives of domestic and for eign policies,” had been at tained by amending the agreement. Marcos proceeded to briefly discuss the concatenation of events taking place in the world, which presented difficulties and “opportunities for peace, security and national development in our immediate regions.” After examining “the problem of military bases” in the country at the start of the twentieth century, Marcos presented the amendments to the agreement namely: (1) Recognition of Philippine sovereignty over the bases by the United States; (2) Designation of a Philippine commander at each base; (3) Commitment of the Philippine government to the unimpeded US “military operations”; (4) Reduction of “base areas” under American control; (5) Philippine “takeover” of the “perimeter security” of the bases; and (6) “thorough and complete review and reassessment” of the agreement every five years. President Marcos reported that the United States President Jimmy Carter pledged to provide $500 million in military assistance for a period of five years. The Final Liberation I THOUGHT IT wise and proper that on this the first day of the resumption of our session after the Christmas recess, I come to you to render a full report and through you, to the people of the 456 Philippines, on the latest amendments to the Military Bases Agreement with the United States or iginally entered into by our country on March 14, 1947. A clear sense of history should underline the significance of this development as it has taken first of all an entire generation to bring this about. More than that, however, the question of for eign military bases in our land has been a major thing in our struggles and in our history as a people, particularly in the evolution of our security and for eign policies. They have always constituted the unfinished business of our liberation, of our in dependence, the loose thread in our continuing struggle for complete emancipation. Every nation, most especially a developing nation, or the colonized nations of the world have three primary objectives, and those are: the at tainment of sovereignty, the achievement of security, and full economic development and modernization. I have always maintained that these are likewise the three primary objectives of our for eign and domestic policies. I submit to you that the first of these objectives has been achieved by the Amendment to the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, and that the last two objectives have been secured by such amendment. It has been a long and arduous, of ten bitter and frustrating struggle, which is the case in any negotiations where equality cannot be assumed. From the beginning, historical circumstances did not favor us with the odds, for as everyone knows, that matter of for eign military bases in our homeland were with us since the proclamation of our Independence on June 12, 1898, an in dependence that was all but won by the Philippine Revolution, the first revolution in this part of the world, which established the Republic. I wish to report to you and to our people that in the last few days, months, and perhaps even years, and during this period especially when the Batasang Pambansa was recessed, a train of events took place in our country and in the world which once again underscored the challenge to and the opportunities for peace, security and national development in our immediate regions. The fact that these events came too close to one another, and so near our own country appears to have in creased their impact upon us, and there is a feeling across the nation of searching and in quiry into the meaning of these events. My report will review these events and state for our nation my assessment of how and where we stand to day — in the midst of all these disturbing developments. In the first few days of 1979, the following events—all of in ternational importance and magnitude — occurred: On the first day of January 1979, the United States and the People’s Republic of China for mally established diplomatic relations, ending 30 years of abnormal relations with each other. The United States also for mally severed relations with Taiwan, the reby bringing to a close a historic association upon which had rested a major pillar of American policy in Asia"

The United States also for mally severed relations with Taiwan, the reby bringing to a close a historic association upon which had rested a major pillar of American policy in Asia. It is of course known to everyone that Taiwan is 90 miles north of the northernmost island of the Philippines. 457 A kind of euphoria seemed to sweep the United States as a result of this normalization. In our part of the world, the calculation has to do with how such normalization of relations enhanced the prospects of peace and trade, given China’s position in this part of the world. Previous to this, Japan and China had entered into a historic treaty of friendship, opening to Japan one more vast and hitherto untapped market On the other side of Asia, Vietnam had earlier for ged a treaty with the Soviet Union, a provision of which reads very much like a mutual defense pact; it says that in the event of any threat arising to any of the parties, the two parties shall enter into mutual consultations on how to remove such threat. At the same time that the nations in Southeast Asia, as elsewhere, were trying to analyze the meaning and portents of normal relations between Peking and Washington, the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced new in creases in the price of oil. Scheduled to reach 14.5 percent over last year’s prices by the end of 1979, these in creases added yet a new wrinkle to the economic prospects or lack of prospects in 1979—an element that further complicates an already complicated and confused situation, owing to the not completely liquidated in flationary pressures of 1978. Last week we received as guest the Foreign Minister of the Somali Democratic Republic, His Excellency Dr. Abdirahman Jama Barre. He arrived to for mally in form our government and the governments of ASEAN that because of the armed in tervention of for eign troops allegedly in support of Ethiopian armed for ces, Somali has been for ced to abandon the Ogaden Desert where the Somali s and the Ethiopians have been fighting a long grueling war. In Iran, the world’s second biggest supplier of crude oil, the long reign of the Shah finally came under siege, and at the beginning of the year, a new government was for med and prepared to take over, as the Shah came under in creasing pressure to leave the peacock throne. On January 7, 1979, the flag of the Kampuchea United Front for National Salvation was hoisted over the central temple of Phnom Penh, signaling the takeover by the Front of the Kampuchean capital and ending a 45-month-old communist regime that had itself taken power by violent means to wards the end of the Vietnam war. In addition to this, I would like to go back to 1978 on the occasion of the visit to Manila of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh of Vietnam. The visit was at my in stance and with the participation of our Foreign Minister Romulo. The two prime ministers came to an agreement, and signed the declaration that Vietnam and the Philippines would settle any misunderstanding and conflicts, especially over oui 1 boundaries in the South China Sea, peaceably and in a spirit of cooperation and friendship. On the occasion of my state visit to the People’s Republic of China in 1975 to establish diplomatic relations with that big nation, ah understanding was entered into with the then leadership, Chairman Mao Tse-tung as well as premier Chou En-lai, who were still alive. The understanding was also entered into with Senior Deputy Premier Teng Hsiao-ping to the effect that any conflict between the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China as to sovereignty 458 over any of the questioned islands in the South China Sea would be decided through normal diplomatic procedures. It should be remembered, however, that before the with drawal of United States for ces from Vietnam, there was reported the occupation by the People’s Republic of China of the Paracels. I ment ion these developments to point out that the conclusion of the re-negotiation of our agreements with the United States on military bases took place amid an unstable, unpredictable in ternational situation. At exactly the same time that power was changing hands in Kampuchea, and new fears were being expressed about the peace and stability in Southeast Asia, the Philippines and the United States were exchanging notes on a six-point amendment to the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, which has the effect of ending dramatically thorny issues that had long troubled the agreement and the relations between the two countries. These events, taken separately or to gether, have altered the world of our concerns, and it is in the midst of these developments that our people are asking to be in for med of the dangers and prospects that they now face. Have these developments made our part of the world more or less dangerous to live in? Have they made our country more vulnerable to in surgency from within, or at tack from outside? Have they in creased, or lessened our ability to cope? These are just some of the questions. To answer any of them, we must begin by remembering that the world in which we live is no longer the simple, uncomplicated black and white world of the fifties or the sixties. It has changed. Where before our for eign policy was shaped mainly by a war psychology that saw the United States and the Soviet Union as in evitably coming upon each other’s throat, to day, in spite of the numerous brushfires that have set aflame certain countries in Asia and Africa, we have come to expect greater progress in peaceful coexistence and detente and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. We are the refore able to look at conflicts, even when the protagonists are reported to be getting support from some of the superpowers, objectively, with out being panicked into belief that the final confrontation of superpowers is at hand"

Where before our for eign policy was shaped mainly by a war psychology that saw the United States and the Soviet Union as in evitably coming upon each other’s throat, to day, in spite of the numerous brushfires that have set aflame certain countries in Asia and Africa, we have come to expect greater progress in peaceful coexistence and detente and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. We are the refore able to look at conflicts, even when the protagonists are reported to be getting support from some of the superpowers, objectively, with out being panicked into belief that the final confrontation of superpowers is at hand. Thus we can distinguish the threats that confront our neighbors and those that confront us, and we can distinguish real national opportunities even when they are born of the womb of crisis. Perhaps we should go back a few more years and look into the problem of military bases in the Philippines at the beginning of the century. For it has as a background complicated twists and turns that started with the arrival of Admiral Dewey in Manila Bay in 1898 and the abortive at tempt of Aguinaldo to win recognition for the first Philippine Republic through his ambassadors. The first ambassador was Agoncillo and his first for eign minister Mabini. Receiving arms and encouragement from the American of ficers, he resumed the revolution against Spain in 1898 notwithstanding the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, declared the in dependence of 459 the Philippines, and established the Republic of the Philippines on June 12, 1898, only to declare war on the United States when he was convinced that the promise of in dependence would not be fulfilled. After the capture of Aguinaldo on March 1901 and the establishment of a civil government in accordance with the Philippine Bill of 1902, the American occupation of the Philippines was for malized under the sometimes declared ambiguous trusteeship to prepare the Filipinos for self- government and the implied promise of political emancipation. The entire territory of the Philippines, as described in the Treaty of Paris of December 30, 1898, was occupied and placed at the disposal of the American military authorities. The situation continued even after the approval by the United States Congress of subsequent fundamental laws, especially the Jones Law of 1916 which created the Philippine Senate with 24 elective members and two appointive members from the non-Christian population of the Philippines, and with the House of Representatives composed of 84 elected members and nine appointive members representing the non-Christian tribes. The new Senate replaced the appointive Philippine Commission. The system of representation was augmented by the appointment of two Filipino resident commissioners who represented the Philippines in the United States House of Representatives with the right to debate but not the right to vote. The most well-known resident commissioners, of course, were President Manuel Luis Quezon, and later on, during the war before the proclamation of in dependence, our own colleague, Minister Carlos P. Romulo. I do not know what it means to have the right to debate but not the right to vote. But I gather from one of our friends in the American House of Representatives that with the representatives we had in the United States, they would have preferred to have given us the right to vote and not the right to talk. During the entire period of 1902 to 1934, the latter year marking the passage of the Hare-Hawes Cutting Law — the law that would grant in dependence to the Philippines after a period of 10 years of Commonwealth — the problem of military alliances, or for eign policy for that matter, security, military bases and arms for the Philippines, or for that matter, again, that of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, did not at tract either public or private debate, for the primary problem in Filipino minds was political emancipation. The question of military bases however was brought to the public mind by the ‘”pro” and “anti” campaign over the Hare-Hawes Cutting Act in 1934, the political campaign which arose from the fight for supremacy between the partnership of Osmeña and Roxas on the one side — for this, too, had succeeded in obtaining the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act from the American Congress — and on the other side, Senate President Manuel Luis Quezon, who opposed the ratification of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law ostensibly because of its provision authorizing the establishment of American military bases in the Philippines even after in dependence. The Filipino people rejected the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, and subsequently, Senate President Manuel Luis Quezon succeeded in obtaining the approval by the United States Congress of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Law which had the same provisions as the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, except that it provided among others that the President of the United States, and I quote, “was 460 authorized to enter into negotiations with for eign powers with the view of concluding a treaty for the perpetual neutralization of the Philippines even when Philippine in dependence would have been achieved.” President Quezon was quoted later in his own book entitled “The Good Fight” as saying, and I quote him: “My main objection however was to the provision of the law that called for the retention of military and naval establishments by the United States after the Philippine Republic should have been proclaimed I did not object to the provision authorizing the retention of naval stations so long as this was made dependent upon the concept of the Philippines Republic. But I did strenuously and definitely oppose the retention of military establishments otherwise, for it destroyed the very essence of in dependent existence for the Philippines.” But after President Quezon was compelled to abandon the Philippines and depart from Corregidor in the middle of the war and during the fighting in Bataan and Corregidor, and after establishing the refugee government in Washington, Joint Resolution No"

The Japanese had by then occupied the Philippines of course, and the American policy was for giving priority to the European the ater of war. President Quezon acceded to the resolution on the establishment of military bases in the Philippines. After the war, by the Treaty of General Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America on July 4, 1946— this treaty is generally referred to as the treaty that granted in dependence to the Philippines — the United States agreed, and I quote, “to with draw and surrender and thus, hereby, with draw and surrender all rights of possession, supervision, jurisdiction, control or sovereignty existing and exercised by the United States in and over the territory and people of the Philippine Islands, except the use of such bases and the rights in cident the reto as the United States of America by agreement of the Republic of the Philippines may deem necessary to retain for the mutual protection of the Republic of the Philippines and of the United States.” In addition to this, the Philippines amended its Constitution to establish what is commonly referred to as “parity rights” to American citizens — parity rights over the patrimony of the nation. But let us listen to President Roxas explaining the reason for all these actuations. He said, and I quote him: “Against the background of destruction, we acquired our sovereignty. We received our national heritage. We must perform more miracles to bring prosperity to this our land. To succeed in this imperative, we have the assistance and support of the United States. Without that assurance, our prospects would be bleak and dimmed “ 461 According to President Roxas, the granting of parity amendment, as well as the military bases agreement, was one of the several conditions for the approval of the War Damage Act and the trade agreement which the Philippines seriously needed at the time. On March 14, 1947, the Military Bases Agreement was entered into by the two countries. It may be stated in passing that the parity amendment of the Constitution was allowed to lapse and has not been renewed. It terminated at midnight of July 3, 1974, and this administration has refused to extend it further. In addition to the Military Bases Agreement, the Philippines entered into the Mutual Defense Pact of August 30, 1951, immediately after our sending expeditionary troops, or rather, police action troops to Korea, and the Military Assistance Agreement of March 21, 1947 or almost simultaneously with the Military Bases Agreement. Of course the Military Assistance Agreement of March 21, 1947, was amended on June 26, 1953. This new capability to judge and act for ourselves is an achievement of the last six years. It was during that period when we finally embarked on a full-scale diversification of relations with the socialist countries, with ASEAN, Asia, Africa and the Third World. Before this period, we had what is of ten referred to as a dependent for eign policy. It was during this period when we proclaimed the liberation of that policy. It was also during this period when others began to take us seriously for the in itiatives we took for ourselves, rather than in the name of our allies. It was during this period, finally when we made the most significant effort to reexamine and readjust our longest close association with any other country — our relations with the United States. As President, it was my privilege to preside over this effort. In 1966, on my state visit to the United States, we entered into a landmark amendment to the 1947 bases agreement by cutting down to 25 years the unexpired portion of the or iginal 99-year duration of the military bases. Subsequent the reto, certain portions of the bases were transferred to the Philippine Government. These in cluded Sangley Point, Mactan Air Base, portions of Clark and Camp John Hay, as well as weather observation in stallations and early warning systems. Renegotiation and readjustment of the terms of the agreement gained new impetus after the resolution of the Vietnam war, when it appeared to many that American policy was undergoing a sea-change in Asia, and questions were being asked, even within the United States, about the appropriateness of American commitments in Asia and the Pacific. This was particularly heightened by our anxiety about the lack of an automatic retaliation clause in our Mutual Defense Pact, in case of armed at tack on the Philippines by another power, and an unclear definition of what areas of our territory would be covered by American protection in case of at tack. Added to this was the in creasing disquiet of some sectors of our citizenry who have through the years questioned the need for the bases, and the wisdom of the treaties that bind Philippine defense with the United States. We had three alternatives: 1) to work for the abrogation of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, with all its consequences on the balance of power in western Pacific; 2) to allow the continued deadlock on the negotiations and thus permit the continued operation of the bases by the United States, with out any basic change in the terms which we had long described as on erous to our 462 country and with out relief from the grievances and irritants that had troubled Philippine- American relations; and 3) to at tain the best possible terms while allowing the United States to operate the bases or parts the reof, giving special stress to their continued existence in the country will serve not only American but also Philippine in terests. In considering which alternative to pursue, it was my firm belief that three objectives had to be met, namely: sovereignty, security, and economic modernization and development. The first alternative, abrogation of the Military Bases Agreement, presupposes the existence of a mechanism in the or iginal agreement for unilateral abrogation on the part of either of the parties to the agreement.

I would like to call at tention to this point because during the entire debate, nobody ever raised it. But there is no mechanism provided for in the 1947 Military Bases Agreement for the abrogation or rescission of the treaty by either of the parties. There has been no amendment either providing for such abrogation. If one party the refore at tempts to unilaterally abrogate the agreement with out such mechanism, the other party if it so wishes could under in ternational law in sist on the in tegrity of the agreement and do what it can do to enforce its rights. Specifically, were we to abrogate the military bases unilaterally, in legal terms and legal contemplation, the United States could maintain the same position that it held with respect to its Guantanamo base in Cuba: it refused to move out. You will all remember of course that Fidel Castro wanted to close down the base because it was a continued reminder of American presence on Cuban soil. But because the Cuban-U. S. agreement, which is similar to our 1947 agreement, contained no provision for unilateral termination, the United States could not be budged from the base, and it remains in control of Guantanamo up to now. On, the other hand, the second alternative of allowing the continued operation of the agreement with out any basic changes in the terms, of fered no relief for the many grievances and irritants that have long troubled the amity or R. P. – U. S. ties. Simple common sense and concern for the national in terest at the very least required that the Philippine Government exert every effort to remove those elements of the agreement that we found on erous. They required us to relieve those obligations and provisions that impugn our national sovereignty. Most of all, they required us to seek changes in the agreement with out sacrificing its more salutary aspects. Thus, the only acceptable alternative was the amendment of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, with a view to ending its on erous provisions and to in troducing new provisions that would fully recognize Philippine sovereignty, enhance national security, and promote national economic development. This approach became the basis for the position we presented in the negotiations, both at the start of the talks and in the ensuring deadlocks and delays that developed. My colleagues will well remember that the negotiations began almost immediately after my assumption of the Presidency in 1965, then gathered momentum three years ago, following the 463 joint communique of President Gerald Ford and myself on December 7, 1975, which set “negotiations on the subject of the United States use of Philippine military bases.” Needless to say, the participation by the members of the Philippine panel has been dedicated and patriotic. I refer most particularly, of course, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the Honorable Juan Ponce Enrile, the Solicitor General, the Minister of Justice, and in the last few meetings, also the Minister of the Budget, the Minister of Finance, for mer Vice President Emmanuel Pelaez who has been most in for mative and who guided us in the previous negotiations which frustratingly had negative results. And from the military we or ganized the military panel which was headed by our Chief of Staff, General Romeo Espino. To summarize, the substance of the new amendments are found principally in four documents. These four documents are: the letter of President Carter to me which is dated January 4, 1979; the letter of U. S. State Secretary Cyrus Vance to the Minister of Foreign Affairs; the exchange of notes; the letter of U. S. Ambassador Murphy to Minister Romulo; and of course, the document entitled. The Arrangements Pertaining to the Base Commander and the United States Facilities Commander.” Now let me summarize the contents of these documents: First, the bases which are the subject of the agreement are to be known as Philippine Military Bases over which Philippine sovereignty extends, and that only the Philippine flag shall be flown singly at the bases; Second, that each base shall be under the command of a Philippine base commander; Third, that the-United States shall have the use of certain facilities and areas within the bases, and shall be assured unhampered military operations in volving its for ces in the Philippines; Fourth, that the base areas shall be reduced from their erstwhile dimensions; portions of the base areas will be developed by the Philippine Government for non-military purposes, and in this development the United States of America has shown in terest and in tends to participate. Fifth, that the Philippine Government will provide for the perimeter security. The proper term will be “will take over the perimeter security of the bases”; and Sixth, that every fifth year from the date of signing of the Amendment, and until the termination of the Military Bases Agreement, there shall be a thorough and complete review and reassessment of the agreement to ensure that it continues to serve the mutual in terest of both parties. From the above amendments, our people will note that full recognition is given, at last, to Philippine sovereignty over the bases, removing all the ambiguities and doubts that once at tended this question. Perhaps, the members of Congress will remember the Bronell opinion or 464 the statement of a for mer Attorney General of the United States claiming that America had sovereignty over these bases. As a result of the agreement on perimeter security, we have secured a corrective to the many regrettable in cidents that have occurred in the bases. For as the exchange of notes itself says, this is going to lessen the contact between the American servicemen on duty and our Filipino civilians"

Beyond the sovereignty question, we must also note that the Amendment in no way diminishes the contribution that the bases can make to the security of the country and the rest of Asia and the Pacific. In extending to the United States Government unhampered military operations in volving its for ces in the country, we have done no more than extend what is essential for the effective operations of the bases as a defense in strument in this part of the world. It is understood that when one speaks of military operations, there is a need for such military operations. Indeed, as is readily apparent in the letter of President Jimmy Carter to me dated January 4, 1979, you will all note that apart from the expression of elation over the amendments, President Carter pledges substantial assistance and support to the self-reliance defense program of the Philippines. I wish to read into the records the text of President Carter’s letter: xxx Dear Mr. President: I was pleased to learn that our negotiations have reached agreement on an amendment to the 1947 Military Bases Agreement. In light of this development, I wish to state that the executive branch of the United States Government will, during the next five fiscal year, make its best effort to obtain appropriations for the Philippines of the following amounts of security assistance. In addition, the United States will give prompt and systematic consideration to requests for specific items of military equipment to be provided under these programs, and to requests for the sale of other military equipment which your Government may wish to Military Assistance $50 million Foreign Military Sales Credit $250 million Security Supporting Assistance $200 million 465 purchase through the U. S. Government or commercial channels, consistent with the world-wide policies of this Government with respect to the transfer of conventional arms. In closing, let me state once again that I appreciate your personal efforts in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion. I believe that the Amendment to which our two Governments have now agreed will strengthen the security not only of the Philippines and the United States but also of the entire western Pacific region. xxx My colleagues in this Assembly will note that this is the first time that the President of the United States has written in a for mal document a promise of this nature — a commitment to obtain from the U. S. Congress specified amounts for military assistance to another country. This has never been done before. The truth of the matter is, we did not expect the American Government to be able to grant this concession to us. Thus we can at tain self-reliance in security, or now seriously take the steps necessary to at tain self-reliance in the medium term and in the long term. In the letter of U. S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to Minister Romulo, which forms part of our agreement, the United States gives assurance that in cases where criminal jurisdiction is at issue, it will follow the same procedure that is being followed by the United States in member- countries of NATO and in Japan. This means, according to the Vance letter, that “in those cases where of ficial duty is at issue between the United States and Philippine Governments, United States for ces have developed procedures to retain accused personnel in the Philippines for a reasonable time, and to prevent their in advertent departure, in or der to provide opportunities for discussions between the two goverments relating to the jurisdictional question.” Allow me to explain the background of this, which is well-known to those who participated in the negotiations before 1965. In the or iginal 1947 Military Bases Agreement, criminal jurisdiction over any of fenses committed by American soldiery within the bases was exclusively America’s. Outside the bases it was exclusively Philippine. Somehow with the Mendez-Blair agreement which was entered into before our colleague, for mer Vice President Pelaez, became the secretary, after but with out consultation, I hope — under the 1947 agreement, it was provided that in case of any conflict the Minister of Justice or Secretary of Justice would decide whether the issuance of a duty certificate was proper. This was changed by the Mendez-Blair agreement, which returned the situation to what we have now, which is similar to the NATO and the Japanese statute of for ces agreements. Now to my mind the most important aspect of criminal jurisdiction is the provision pertaining to the Philippine program to upgrade the reverted areas and the regions around the reverted areas. Thus the penultimate paragraph of page 3 of the exchange of diplomatic notes of the American embassy states: The two parties take note of the economic and social conditions in the areas surrounding the bases and express their joint in terest in developing programs designed to upgrade to upgrade them.” This was one of the points on which we were persistent. 466 We in sisted that if there was any in tention whatsoever for the military bases facilities to continue, there must be an effort to upgrade the reverted areas and the regions around the military bases so that it would not look as if the Filipinos residing around the bases were beggars in their own homeland. It is further amplified by the letter of Secretary Cyrus Vance to Minister Romulo which states in the first paragraph of page three, and I read: “With respect to base lands outside the United States facilities and the surrounding areas, the United States Government is ready to consider the question of economic assistance and other United States programs for suitable projects as well as projects that might appropriately be undertaken by private enterprises"

I consider this a historic agreement in asmuch as it completes the liberation of the Philippines. I am sure that many of us, especially those who belong to my generation, remember the feeling of fulfillment, nay, of tearful fulfillment, when on July 4, 1945 we watched the United States High Commissioner bring down the American flag and the Philippine President raise the Philippine national flag to rule supreme and sovereign over our land. This feeling of accomplishment was disturbed only by the nagging thought that the American flag and American sovereignty might still rule supreme in some part of our land. It is the refore with a feeling of personal fulfillment that we witness the finalization of a new bases agreement. For we the allies in this part of the world in the last World War, finished the task that we had sought to accomplish and at tain, which is the full and complete freedom of the Republic of the Philippines.

Marcos President of the Philippines On a New Philippines, a New Republic [Delivered on June 18, 1981] A NEW PHILIPPINES, A NEW REPUBLIC The speech is culled from Marcos, F. E. (1981), Speeches by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. [Manila]: Presidential Library and uploaded at https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/1981/06/18/speech-of-president marcos-on-a-new-philippines-a-new-republic/. Catapulted to the presidency in 1965, President Ferdinand Marcos secured a second term in 1969. By virtue of Proclamation No. 1081, President Marcos placed the country under martial law on September 21, 1972, following a spate of bombings in Metro Manila. Constitutional authoritarianism supplanted the democratic in stitutions. On February 25, 1986, after four days of bloodless EDSA People Power Revolution, Marcos was compelled to step down and flee with his family to Hawaii. This speech, which was delivered on June 18, 1981, revolved around his vision of “New Filipinism.” Contextualizing his vision, President Marcos remarked that it was for mulated at a time when the world was mired in “crisis and contradictions.” Marcos stressed that it embodied the “ethic of in dependence, focusing on “substance rather than the shadow of freedom” and in dependence beyond for mality to reality.” As he sounded the clarion call for “in novation in our social, economic, political and cultural life,” he emphasized that “New Filipinism” itself was a “call for in novation” and ventured to say that the vision signified a bloodless “revolution directed against the sterile and self-defeating habits of the race.” In the concluding part of the speech, President Marcos posed the challenge to the Filipino people: “We must liberate ourselves for the sake of a new republic, the in evitable child of the new society.” Sixteen years ago, on this same sacred ground, we shared to gether a vision of Filipino greatness. It was this vision which guided us in the gravest crises; we owe to it our triumphs; it has kept us whole. You will recall that on my second mandate, I gave it a definition– the New Filipinism. I said then that “the New Filipinism represents the discipline and the ethic of in dependence, that it seeks the 470 substance rather than the shadow of freedom, that it develops in dependence beyond for mality to reality.” Let me recall to you the exact words, for they provide a perspective for to day: “Under the in fluence of this spirit, we have started to re-examine our own narrow outlook on ourselves and the world; we have ceased to think ourselves as a small and in significant nation, a non-entity in world affairs; we have started to re-examine the time-honored postulates by which we have lived in the past five hundred years, and have lifted our sights to wider horizons and more ambitious and peremptory goals. “In the for eseeable future, this new spirit will prompt us to re-examine our own basic in stitutions and perhaps recast them to make them more responsive to the needs of our people. We must not hesitate, from a sense of racial timidity, to change what should be changed. From hereon we should be guided only by our own sense of what will advance, protect and fulfill our national in terest. “We must aim at the reality rather than the for mality of democracy. Political and social in stitutions that merely perpetuate entrenched privileges based on the accident of birth must be remolded or replaced with new ones that promote genuine democracy... “We must not be afraid of in novation in our social, economic, political and cultural life. The New Filipinism is a call for in novation– a revolution directed against the sterile and self-defeating habits of the race but with out bloodshed and with out fratricide. “The New Filipinism is. ultimately a call to greatness. But any form of greatness must begin with an act of will... Transformed by the New Filipinism, the Filipino people will no longer return to the sterility, mediocrity and timidity of the past. The new spirit of achievement will be in destructible, and will fashion, in time, a great nation of Asia.” In connection, I asked you, the Filipino people, whether we should venture into a new world of possibility or retreat to the safety of a familiar but sterile past, and your answer was– we should cross the frontier"

From hereon we should be guided only by our own sense of what will advance, protect and fulfill our national in terest. “We must aim at the reality rather than the for mality of democracy. Political and social in stitutions that merely perpetuate entrenched privileges based on the accident of birth must be remolded or replaced with new ones that promote genuine democracy... “We must not be afraid of in novation in our social, economic, political and cultural life. The New Filipinism is a call for in novation– a revolution directed against the sterile and self-defeating habits of the race but with out bloodshed and with out fratricide. “The New Filipinism is. ultimately a call to greatness. But any form of greatness must begin with an act of will... Transformed by the New Filipinism, the Filipino people will no longer return to the sterility, mediocrity and timidity of the past. The new spirit of achievement will be in destructible, and will fashion, in time, a great nation of Asia.” In connection, I asked you, the Filipino people, whether we should venture into a new world of possibility or retreat to the safety of a familiar but sterile past, and your answer was– we should cross the frontier. Twelve years have passed since we enunciated the New Filipinism. We have not only re- examined our outlook on ourselves and the world; we have, in fact, changed it– as well as the world’s regard for us. That for eseeable future of re-examination of our basic political and social in stitutions has come to pass: we have radically changed our in stitutions; we created a new social and political or der. In sum, we changed what needed to be changed. That all this had to be done under a crisis government at tests to the strength, the compelling power, of the vision rather than its weakness. There was a profound sense of historical necessity when eight years ago, we have had to proclaim martial law. The measures then undertaken were swift and sweeping, as it became evident that slow deliberation and political opportunism in all its forms, subversion, and secession, were endangering the life and liberty of the nation. This is neither the time nor place to review once again the undeniable achievements of the period– the reorientation of economic policy, the recasting of at titudes and the revolution in 471 society. Rather is this the time for another re-examination, for having achieved so much, the question now is whether we have achieved enough. It was not meant for this generation– a generation which has seen the horrors of war and confronted the challenges of peace– merely to win the struggle for national survival. We were not meant, perhaps, simply to surmount crisis, heroic as that may be, but to achieve national harmony, economic prosperity and social equality. Some may call it fate, others destiny, but whatever its name, history has a will and logic which a people can only ignore at its own peril. Your overwhelming mandate appear to-confirm this fate. So, then, we must start anew. Sixteen years ago, we woke up to a world in change. Now we are in a world of crisis and contradictions. The Third World nations need to be self-reliant in a world that is irrevocably in terdependent. All nations recognize the imperative necessity for a new world economic or der but few nations, especially the rich, would accept a change in their own economies. There is a clamor for peace and a preparation for war. We need to cooperate but persist to take advantage. Meanwhile, the poor, which make up two-thirds of the world’s peoples, are bewildered and resentful of the high professions and low in tentions of the privileged. It is against this setting that we have dedicated ourselves to the pursuit of a vision– Jose Rizal’s century-old prophecy of a New Philippines. We are also in fected with the world’s malaise, a particular reflection of its crises and contradictions. We are not, the refore, exempt from the difficulties of the times. Still, we have seen to the transformation of society. Institutions like barangay democracy have been established in or der to give our people true control of their lives in community. At a time when the common people of many nations no longer feel sovereign in their lives, our own people, through the barangays, have a sense of purpose and control. The in stitutions, let us frankly admit, are imperfect; they are young. But they are anchored on a philosophy that Filipinos recognize as their own– the philosophy, or the ideology, if you will, of national liberation. But where in stitutions are the protection of men, it is men who run them, and in this there are more imperfections still. The reason for the failure of some is obvious: they have not “in ternalized,” as Mabini once pointed out in the or iginal revolution, the principles and tenets of the New Society. Thus we have experienced and heard of abuses and in justice, of privilege and in difference, illnesses of old which plague our national life, which can no longer be endured either by this leadership or by our people. These illnesses– the social cancer, as it were– have their roots in the colonial past. They should no longer be a part of us. We must, the refore, resist all the blandishments of the merchants of mendicancy, the propagators of the past, the advocates of colonial restoration. Social in justice, graft and corruption, the abuse of power and the misuse of privilege, were partly collaboration with and partly resistance of an abject people to a government which was not the irs. But we now live basically on our own terms. We have no right to betray ourselves. 472 This was the noble purpose of the sacrifices and lives of our heroic for efathers. It was for this purpose that they established the first authentic Filipino republic– the first Asian Republic– nearly a century ago and it is the purpose of our New Republic, which we in augurate to day, keeping faith faith with the vision of unity, equality, and liberty. We look back on the First Republic because it was self-proclaimed by the Filipino people on June 12, 1898; for three hundred and fifty years, the in articulated aspirations of the people had in exorably led to this event. There were, to be sure, two other in dependence days– on October 14, 1943 under the sponsorship of the Japanese Imperial Army and on July 4, 1946, as a grant of the American government. It is not in denigration of these events that we choose to call ours the New Republic, with its historical roots in Kawit, but out of a rediscovered sense of identity and recovered national pride. Our national liberation must be an act of our own political will. What is then new in our republic is its fidelity to our historical legacy and its repudiation of the colonial past, in so far that its opportunism and mendacity have left their mark upon us"

Possessed of our identity, restored to our destiny, we can meet any external challenge and bear any difficulty. But the way of national liberation is not imperilled by for ces outside of ourselves; it is ourselves that we must ultimately conquer. Tempting, in deed, is the comfort of collaboration against the perils of resistance; a royal road seduces those who would progress with out sacrifice, who would be free with out effort. Yet history has marked this as a false road whose destination is enslavement and oblivion. In this regard, there can be no one to look to; there can be no outside savior. There is only us– the Filipinos. We cannot survive, we cannot advance with out being one race, one nation. We have known where division has led us– let us dare where unity must lead us. The national unity that is so vital to our existence is a covenant between each and every Filipino; it is also a covenant between the leader and his people. The rare honor that you have bestowed on me as your thrice-elected leader imposes on my person– and those closest to me– a debt, an obligation, that I cannot shirk and a pledge that I dare not betray. Let history judge me harshly on this, my renewed pledge: that until every Filipino can say with conviction that he has been liberated from the bondage of ignorance, poverty, and disease– that until he can call his mind, body, and spirit truly his own, I shall have failed you and betrayed your trust. From you, my countrymen, I ask the utmost commitment, the limits of your capacities as citizens, the endurance of all hardships and sacrifices for the common good– not as a personal demand but as a way of your keeping faith with the vision of our race. Give all that you can give to your country, and, God-willing, I will give you, with your support, a society that will respond to all your needs for a decent and honorable life. We have not been brought into this world simply to enjoy and in dulge a brief existence. The poorest among us have a sense of life as meaningful existence. In our most miserable state, we are a part of mankind and its noble dream. We may call it, as we call it now, Filipino humanism, a nationalist humanism, but behind the concept and the precept is that certain knowledge within us that Man is the wonder of creation, that all of us must, in the end, realize ourselves in the service of our common humanity. 473 Let us call on the in transigent to realize their just purposes with us; let us awaken the unconscious and enlighten the misled; let us listen to our detractors in honest counsel. Let us, in sum, get to gether, bind the wounds of the past, and, in one united effort, realize the aspirations of our people.! We must also be firm in our resolution and not compromise our aims. History is a merciless and at times even a cruel judge. As your president, I will risk the judgment, but as your fellow- countryman, I urgently appeal to you to spare the next generations from the retribution which could be brought about by our own complacency. We must liberate ourselves for the sake of a new republic, the in evitable child of the new society. As I asked you twelve years ago, I ask you now: let us cross one more frontier!

[Manila]: Presidential Library, 1982. https://tinyurl. com/ y 5 ggjz 8 u. Catapulted to the presidency in 1965, President Ferdinand Marcos secured a second term in 1969. By virtue of Proclamation No. 1081, President Marcos placed the country under martial law on September 21, 1972, following a spate of bombings in Metro Manila. Constitutional authoritarianism supplanted the democratic in stitutions. On February 25, 1986, after four days of bloodless EDSA People Power Revolution, Marcos was compelled to step down and flee with his family to Hawaii. In the essay entitled True Filipino Ideology, President Marcos propounded an “emergent national ideology.” Tracing the evolution of the ideology, Marcos distinguished two main phases. For the first phase, he spoke of “political liberation,” which passed through two stages: the first one consisted in rebuilding the democratic base through the drafting of a new constitution, asserting the sovereignty over the military bases and national patrimony and allowing the illiterates to exercise their right to vote; and the second was launch of the New Republic “spawned by a new society.” The second phase manifests itself as “social and economic liberation, which was made possible by the “the reforms and transformations in social and economic relationships in the New Society.” The political and socio-economic liberation were in vigorated by “cultural re- awakening,” which entails “cultural reconstruction.” It is a distinct pleasure and a welcome opportunity to meet with men and women who knew the meaning of commitment. But most of all I am heartened by the fact that you perceive in what you call the Marcos ideology a suitable purpose for your purpose and a moving force for year commitment. I am not surprised by this action on your part, for what you call—and others call— the Marcos ideology is not the authorship of one man; the genuine authorship belongs to the Filipino people, and to you, who are conscious of being Filipino, the ideology cannot be but compelling and at tractive"

An ideology, as you well know may be for mulated and defined by one man or a few, but it cannot be a true ideology unless it stems from the historical experience—the blood and guts—of a people conscious of their destiny. Just as you and I have been shaped by our respective life 475 experiences, a national ideology springs from the very agonies, sacrifices, dreams and aspirations of a race, a people who have shared a common existence. That ideology is emergent among our people. I say “emergent” because we have only begun to see ourselves with our own eyes, to confront our history with determined purpose, perhaps, we may even set the date of that beginning a decade ago, when confronted with the gravest crisis our young nation has ever known, we recognized the supreme necessity of survival. Our society was on the verge of collapse, our nation on the brink of dismemberment, and our people at the very edge of bloody, fratricidal conflict. It was then that we realized that we either had to pull ourselves to gether or perish separately. Looking back to that fateful decision ten years ago, we may feel sad that the martial decision had to be taken. But, on the other hand, it was the greatest challenge that we have had to face; and so we are glad that it came at a time when we still had the strength and the for titude to see it through. For history has taught us that challenges could be so overwhelming as to destroy peoples and civilizations. Thus we can say that the martial necessity, the martial law experience, has made us better and stronger Filipinos. For in truth we have been transformed. It is no accident, the refore, that a national ideology had to evolve from that experience, which, however, is but one among many in the history of our people. From the very first uprising of our colonial history, the Filipino have always had a dream of freedom, dignity, and equality. No Filipino who has read the writings of the heroes of the Propaganda Period cannot but be stirred by the sentiments and ideas of Rizal, Mabini, Bonifacio, del Pilar, Burgos and Aglipay. Their lives and literature are the well-springs of Filipino ideology. The heroic men and women who fell in Bataan, Corregidor, and in the mountains and hills in the hour of resistance, died for that ideology. The ideology burned in them even if they did not seek to define it. Now we need to define; it is the task of the moment. A few of our countrymen have strayed to for eign ideologies, different and opposing ideologies, exalting on one side liberty and on the other, equality, pushing, as it were, extreme positions. These are ideologies alien to our nature for they sprung from for eign soil, shaped by cultures different from our own. For while it is true that Truth is universal to all of mankind, the truths of experience are particularized by history and culture. Unless we can understand this, we cannot take the first step to wards national liberation. Happily, however, we have taken the first steps. 476 When we exercised the extraordinary powers provided for in the Constitution in or der to save a threatened republic and to build a new society, we made a decisive act of freedom. You will recall that the Constitution referred to had to be approved by a for eign legislature and its commander-in-chief provision was in tended to quell any act of anti-colonialist resistance by the Filipino people. But we transformed that imposition on our will into a weapon of self- preservation and self-liberation. Having done so, we proceeded to draft a new charter, one that stems from our own sovereign act, a fundamental law by the Filipino, of the Filipino, and for the Filipino. Thus the New Society was new in its fundamental legal aspect: we had a new charter for a new social existence. In the eventful decade that followed, we restored our sovereignty on our patrimony: our flag flew over the military bases; parity—over which an entire nation had been divided—was terminated; our for eign policy became the expression not of our servitude servitude but of our in dependence. For the first time in more than four hundred years, the Filipino could once again claim his soul. The crown of these political acts was the re-enfranchisement of the Filipinos. We expanded the base of political participation by eliminating illiteracy as a disqualification for suffrage, a heritage from a colonialism which conferred the right to vote to a privileged few. Thus we expanded the electorate from a mere 8 million to a more democratic 23 million. At the barangay level, the voting age was reduced to fifteen years in recognition of the responsibility of the youth. Workers representation—in dustrial and agricultural—was effected in the sangunians or councils, again in recognition of the backbone of our society. There cannot be a genuine democracy if the many cannot be heard and properly represented. Such a condition had long in fested our body politic; it was not surprising the refore that call after call for national unity had gone unheeded: there was a deep rebellion—the rebellion of the poor. These are in novations, to be sure. But in one form or another, they were long in articulated hopes. And it has been the privilege of this leadership to articulate them. That was the first phase of our ideological evolution. The second phase is that of the New Republic, a republic spawned by a new society. Having re-established the base of a genuine, viable democracy by a sophisticated political act of liberation, we in augurated the New Republic whose task was to take off from the radical reforms generated by the new society, of which agrarian reform is the major one"

This launched the democratization of wealth by way of response to what we call the rebellion of the poor. As you know, we called the entire process “revolution from the center,” according to the perception that government is hot above the people but in the center of their lives as a national society. Too long had government been either the partner of the oligarchy or its servitor; in liberating itself from the oligarchy, government once again became the focus of popular power. 477 We shall be having our barangay elections next week, on May 17. I in vite all of you and our people to perceive in the elections the actual power of the people at work. The choice of leaders in the barangay is a direct exercise of power at its most fundamental level. The political business of the barangay is the day-to-day communal existence of our people—their economic, social, and cultural life. Henceforth, leaders who fail at this level cannot hope to succeed on the higher level. National leadership is thus rooted in the very lives of the people. With that basic political premise, the New Republic thus proceeds from the reforms and transformations in social and economic relationships in the New Society. Economic reforms were designed to spur growth in the countrysides; labor reforms were, suited to the conditions of enterprise and social justice; the educational system was made relevant to the objectives of in tellectual and moral emancipation; an overview of social and economic needs found form in a new ministry for human settlements. At the centerpiece of these endeavors is the Kilusan sa Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran—the KKK, the movement for livelihood and progress. These are material transformations. Taken by the mselves alone, they would not sum up our liberation as a people. We may have drastically changed the social arrangements, in creased the economic opportunities, of our national society, but unless we enhance our humanity, we can only be robots with full stomachs. What makes us truly human, what binds us to one another, is the hold, the richness, of our culture. In the short span of a decade, we had such a cultural re-awakening, a rediscovery of tradition, a re-examination of history and heritage, that a virtual artistic resurgence followed. We have produced more paintings, sculpture, music, literature, drama of rare and excellent quality than in the four decades after the second world war. Let me just comment on the misguided observation that writers have been silenced. These comments are being made by people who have difficulty in being silent. They are so busy carping that they miss the gems right under their very noses. But let us not be partisan here. The present fact speaks for itself: there has been and continues to be a flowering of cultural and artistic expression. What has spurred all these? Our history. Our consciousness of it, our pride in its glories and defeats, its joys and sorrows, its disasters and triumphs. We rediscovered our history in a moment of crisis; we are consequently making it in an hour of challenge. Our history, in sum, is for ging our emergent national ideology. I will tell you what our ideology is not. While all-embracing, as it covers our political, economic, social, and cultural life, it is not to talitarian; while assertive, it is not dogmatic. It is a deviant Filipino who will be to talitarian and dogmatic, for there is a sense of irony in the Filipino that is resistant to blind obedience. Our numerous revolts in the last century were all reactions not only against the oppressive but also the brazenly unreasonable. 478 We cannot adhere the refore to zealous and doctrinaire creeds for they warp the spirit and brutalize what is human. We prefer an ideology that is tailored to the strengths and weaknesses— the wholeness of the human being. We are human and the refore our ideologies must be humane. On the other hand, our ideology is not a for mula for personal advancement or personal wealth or power; it is not, conversely, a for mula of suppressing the in dividual for the sake of the state; rather is it a basis for united action to wards a society which shall exist for the benefit of all. It is rooted in the bayanihan spirit exemplified by neighbors and friends who help out in transplanting a house. No in dividual profits by this common, cooperative action, but the sense of community is preserved and everyone has a sense of satisfaction. We strike the vital balance between the claims of the in dividual and the demands of the collective thus maintaining, as I said in my books, “a society of equals in a state of liberty.” We have arrived at this aspiration because of our common experience of colonial oppression, in vasion and exploitation not only by for eign powers but also by local tyrants. We knew from the old society a social condition in which “the degradation of the many was pursued for the effloration of the few.” Hence I characterized the politics of that old society as “personalist and populist.” The true Filipino ideology was suppressed so that democracy for the few could prevail. That privileged democracy was reserved for the rich and the educated, more of ten than not the westernized and the in fluential. To a certain extent, we still suffer from its residues—but that privileged democracy has absolutely no place in the New Republic. As we emphasized in the New Society—and we remind ourselves in the New Republic—a social arrangement which perpetuates bondage to the soil, has no right to exist. A political system which regards illiteracy as ignorance rather than educational deprivation is a false democracy"

And so we arrived at equality as the ideological basis of the New Society as we came to the reconciliation of liberty and equality in the New Republic. The society and the republic emerged as the in evitable response to the rebellion of the poor and government was enlisted to in itiate the “revolution from the center.” I say in itiated because it will be the people, you and those who are committed to wards achieving a better life for our people, who must preserve the gains and continue the numerous missions of that revolution from the center. And what is your singular weapon? The true Filipino ideology which is emergent from our historical experience and national dream. In its two phases, the ideology presents itself, first, as political liberation, and, in the second, as social and economic liberation. These, in turn, arc fuelled by our cultural re-awakening which presents to us the task of cultural reconstruction. Our culture, rediscovered in its richness and vitality, is the spiritual architecture, the in tellectual and moral masonry, of our political and socio-economic edifice. 479 Proud to be Filipino, a pride that comes from genuine self-knowledge and not petty braggadocio, we face the modern challenge to our political and economic development; and the center of all these is the Filipino in all his humanity, a Filipino of flesh-and-blood and not the cold, dry number in a statistical table. Our greatest national resource is, after all, is the Filipino. Our national development begins in his mind; the success of our efforts depends on His stout heart. He is at the very heart of our in stitutions, they are meaningless with out him, as our hero, Andres Bonifacio, long ago realized. “Who is for the Philippines except the Filipino?” Mabini asked rhetorically. Historical experience, no less than our for ebears, is quite clear: no one can help us. Only we can help ourselves. And this truth applies to all that is for eign to us, whether it be ideologies or in stitutions. Our destiny is rooted in our soil, our future determined by our particular time and circumstance; our ideology is thus our self-definition. In promoting that emergent Filipino ideology, we can only tell our people, “We are simply giving you what is yours. We are giving you yourselves. It is nothing outside you; it is in side you, imbedded in your experience as a Filipino.” And that is the true Filipino ideology. Marcos, Ferdinand E. Speeches by President Ferdinand E. Marcos.

Ratified: February 2, 1987 537 INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY BENIGNO S. AQUINO III PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES [June 30, 2010, Quirino Grandstand, Rizal Park, Manila] The in augural address is retrieved from https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/about/ gov/exec/bsaiii/platform-of-government/ The political career of Benigno Simeon Aquino III, popularly known as Noynoy, began in 1998 when he won the congressional seat, serving as Representative of the 2 nd district of Tarlac for the constitutionally mandated term limit of three consecutive terms until 2007. Aquino secured a Senate seat in the May 2007 elections under the Genuine Opposition party. Launching his presidential bid in 2009, he joined the 2010 presidential race and won the presidency in the first fully automated elections in the country. At the outset, President Aquino, in his Platform of Government, recognized the compelling need for a “national leadership in need of transformational change. Aquino hastened to say that his parents’ (Ninoy’s and Cory’s) “legacy of change” heralded “renewed hope.” He envisioned a country founded on “re-awakened sense of right and wrong” and “strong solidarity of our society and its communities” and fueled by an “or ganized and widely-shared rapid expansion of our economy.” Adhering to “transformational leadership,” President Aquino affirmed his commitment to combat corruption, alleviate poverty, prioritize education, safeguard public health and equitably dispense justice. A Social Contract with the Filipino People BENIGNO S. AQUINO III PLATFORM OF GOVERNMENT A NATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN NEED OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE Its legitimacy is under question; It persecutes those who expose the truth about its illegitimacy and corruption; It stays in power by corrupting in dividuals and in stitutions; It confuses the people with half-truths and outright lies; It rewards, rather than punishes, wrongdoing; It of fers no lasting solutions for the many problems of the country; It weakens the democratic in stitutions that hold our leaders accountable. It hinders our local governments from delivering basic services; It has no vision of governance beyond political survival and self-enrichment. 538 A PEOPLE CRYING OUT FOR CHANGE Corruption robs our children of their protection, nutrition and education. Corruption destroys our families and communities. Corruption steals from our farmers and workers. Corruption deters businessmen from in vesting in our economy. This has eroded our spirit as in dividuals, as communities, as a people. We have lost trust in the democratic in stitutions we so courageously re-established after the dictatorship. Our proven capacity for collective outrage and righteous resistance has been weakened. We have ceased to depend on the patriotism and civic engagement that used to animate many of our efforts. We have become divided and alienated, focusing only on ourselves and on our in dividual pursuits. Our moral faculties as a people have been paralyzed. We have retreated into a dark world of self-absorption and cynicism. Our collective despair has reached its lowest point. THEN FINALLY, THE GIFT OF LIGHT Cory Aquino passed on to the next life. From our sadness, we awakened to a shaft of light cutting through the darkness. She left the Filipinos a legacy of selfless love for country and people. Filipinos’ connection with each other was rekindled. In death, she enabled us to hope again for decent government. The millions who connected with Cory at her funeral represented something more than euphoria, sentiment or transient emotions. They represented the reverent memory of a good leader in the past and the firm hope of having a similarly good leader in the future. A PEOPLE’S CAMPAIGN OF RENEWED HOPE… Anchored on Ninoy’s and Cory’s legacy of change through the ways of democracy Embraces the qualities of in tegrity, humility and trustworthiness in public leadership Recognizes the absence of these qualities in government as a major cause of widespread poverty, misery and despair. THE VISION FOR THE PHILIPPINES: A COUNTRY WITH… 1. A re-awakened sense of right and wrong, through the living examples of our highest leaders; 2. An or ganized and widely-shared rapid expansion of our economy through a government dedicated to honing and mobilizing our people’s skills and energies as well as the responsible harnessing of our natural resources; 3. A collective belief that doing the right thing does not only make sense morally, but translates into economic value as well; 539 4. Public in stitutions rebuilt on the strong solidarity of our society and its communities. OUR MISSION: We will start to make these changes first in ourselves—by doing the right things, by giving value to excellence and in tegrity and rejecting mediocrity and dishonesty, and by giving priority to others over ourselves. We will make these changes across many aspects of our national life. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: 1. From a President who to lerates corruption to a President who is the nation’s first and most determined fighter of corruption. 2. From a government that merely conjures economic growth statistics that our people know to be unreal to a government that prioritizes jobs that empower the people and provide them with opportunities to rise above poverty. 3. From relegating education to just one of many concerns to making education the central strategy for in vesting in our people, reducing poverty and building national competitiveness. 4. From treating health as just another area for political patronage to recognizing the advancement and protection of public health, which in cludes responsible parenthood, as key measures of good governance. 5"

From demoralized but dedicated civil servants, military and police personnel destined for failure and frustration due to in adequate operational support to professional, motivated and energized bureaucracies with adequate means to perform their public service missions. GENDER EQUALITY 13. From a lack of concern for gender disparities and shortfalls, to the promotion of equal gender opportunity in all spheres of public policies and programs. PEACE & ORDER 14. From a disjointed, short-sighted Mindanao policy that merely reacts to events and in cidents to one that seeks a broadly supported just peace and will redress decades of neglect of the Moro and other peoples of Mindanao. ENVIRONMENT 15. From allowing environmental blight to spoil our cities, where both the rich and the poor bear with congestion and urban decay to planning alternative, in clusive urban developments where people of varying in come levels are in tegrated in productive, healthy and safe communities. 16. From a government obsessed with exploiting the country for immediate gains to the detriment of its environment to a government that will encourage sustainable use of resources to benefit the present and future generations. This platform is a commitment to change that Filipinos can depend on. With trust in their leaders, everyone can work and build a greater future to gether. 541 Message of His Excellency Fidel V. Ramos President of the Philippines To the Congress On the State of the Nation [Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 1993] This document is accessible at https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/1993/07/26/ fidel-v-ramos-second-state-of-the-nation-address-july-26-1993/. Fidel V. Ramos, commonly known as FVR or Eddie, played a pivotal role in the bloodless and non-violent People Power Revolution of 1986 that overthrew the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos. When Corazon Aquino clinched the presidency, Aquino named Ramos as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and later as Secretary of National Defense. Supported by President Aquino, Ramos was catapulted to power, defeating Agrarian Reform Secretary, Miriam Defensor Santiago, by a narrow margin. President Ramos delivered his second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 26, 1993. Ramos opened his address by challenging the honorable members of the Congress “to seize the decisive moment.” He then proceeded to propound and discuss his vision for the country under the catchphrase “Philippines 2000.” Ramos envisaged that the country had evolved into a Newly Industrialized Country (NIC) by the year 2000. “Let’s Seize the Moment!” Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker of the House; ladies and gentlemen of Congress; Your Excellencies; special guests; mahal na kababayan: Noong isang taon, ang at ing mga kababayan ay naghahangad ng panibagong pagsisimula. Ngayon, tapatan nating masasabi na nabigyan natin ang at ing bansa ng bagong pag-asa. A year ago, our people asked of us a new beginning. Today, we can truly claim we have given our country that fresh start. 542 We have arrested the decline—of the economy and the national spirit—which had so demoralized our people. We are concluding a just and honorable peace with the military rebels, the in surgents, and the southern secessionists. A new spirit of cooperation existing between Congress and the presidency has avoided the gridlock which obstructed policy making in previous administrations. And this is as it should be. Executive and legislature are not meant to function in confrontation with each other. Our in vestors and businessmen can almost take political stability for granted once again. The stock market in dex has reached a record high. Window of Opportunity It is true that in some of our concerns—as in the economy—the for ward movement has barely begun. There is still so much to be done. But to day I can report to you of a country and people renewed in purpose. Analyzing our situation in April, the World Bank noted: The Philippines now faces its best prospect for sustained development in almost two decades"

There is still so much to be done. But to day I can report to you of a country and people renewed in purpose. Analyzing our situation in April, the World Bank noted: The Philippines now faces its best prospect for sustained development in almost two decades. A window of opportunity exists for the new government. This optimism about our prospects is not unusual. It is shared by many—here and abroad. But “a window of opportunity” is only that. A momentary opening—which can close sooner than we expect. Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: I in vite you to join me in taking advantage of this opportunity and to seize the decisive moment to gether. This is the challenge to leadership. Everywhere the old politics is in disfavor—because it has failed to respond to the transformations taking place in the world. We must learn new ways of looking at the world. We need new answers to our problems. In this spirit, we of fer a strategic framework for Philippine development. The Strategic Framework: “Philippines 2000” Modernization in our time requires the guidance and direction of a stable and resolute government. 543 Compare the Philippine State with the East Asian dragons. The East Asian States are able to assert their countries’ strategic in terests because they are relatively free from the in fluence of pressure groups. The Philippine State, in the past, had been unable to act consistently in the national in terest because it could not resist the importunings of oligarchic groups. And the economy had been governed largely by politics in stead of markets. Because of this experience, we now know that development cannot take place in our country unless we put our house in or der. And this—to me—means accomplishing three things: One, restoring political and civic stability. Two, opening the economy: dismantling monopolies and cartels in jurious to the public in terest, and leveling the playing field of enterprise. Three, addressing the problem of corruption and criminality. These three tasks—once completed—shall secure the environment for self-sustaining growth— and enable the government to positively and consistently act in the national in terest. Our strategic framework to establish effective government—of putting our house in or der—so that our drive for development can begin—we call “Philippines 2000.” “Philippines 2000” has two components. The first is the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1993-1998 [MTPDP 93-98]. Guided by the principles of people empowerment and global excellence, it proposes specific policies and programs to stimulate economic activity and mobilize the entrepreneurial spirit in or dinary Filipinos. I strongly urge your approval of this medium-term Philippine development plan. The second component of “Philippines 2000” addresses the larger environment—the political, social, and cultural climate—in which economic growth must take place. The crucial question is: Can we reform an undemocratic economy by using a democratic political framework? Authoritarianism eased the way to economic power and higher living standards for our East Asian neighbors. In contrast, we are working to reconcile our democratic politics with an oligarchic economy left over from the colonial period—not by changing the political system, but by democratizing the economy. The time for authoritarianism has passed—in our country and in the world. Instead of the discipline of command, we must in voke the self-discipline of civic responsibility. We Filipinos have always accepted that people with more are obliged to help people with less— in the name of a common, compassionate humanity. This traditional moral code we shall make a principle of public policy. 544 The few who have can never be secure in their possessions for as long as they live among so many who have not. Let me now take up our most urgent sectoral concerns one by one. A. POLITICAL STABILITY AND PEACE AND ORDER 1. Stability and Civic Order Examples from East Asia teach us that the first—and for emost—requirement of economic development is stability, which is the long-term predictability of the social system. This is why we are seeking a comprehensive and lasting peace. As proposed by the National Unification Commission, we will pursue the “paths to peace” by undertaking social, economic, and political reforms that address the root causes of armed conflict; by encouraging people to participate in the peace process; by working for a negotiated settlement with the armed groups; and by establishing programs for the reintegration of rebel groups into the mainstream of society through a general amnesty program. At the same time, let us effect the modernization of our Armed Forces. The cooling down of tensions in the region enables us to set new priorities in defense spending. 2. Peace and Order Peace and or der are the other face of national stability. If we are to release the full energies of the nation, people who live, work, and produce must be secure in their persons, in their property, and in their homes. We have enhanced our in stitutional capability to cope with crime—through the overhaul of the command-and-leadership structure of the Philippine National Police. To this end, I propose that the PNP law (R. A. 6975) be amended to correct its many weaknesses. We will dismantle the private armies that remain. We will not allow any more criminal brotherhoods, as in Calauan, to exist. This in cludes purging local police for ces of scalawags and bullies. Last year, I proposed we restore the death penalty. I ask you to enact that measure as soon as possible. We must show determination to prevent any reversions to barbarism. In particular, I see the merit of bringing the anti-crime effort to the level of the barangay and the neighborhood—by evolving new forms of collaboration between citizens and law enforcers. This way, we can steadily constrict the space where crime can operate"

In particular, I see the merit of bringing the anti-crime effort to the level of the barangay and the neighborhood—by evolving new forms of collaboration between citizens and law enforcers. This way, we can steadily constrict the space where crime can operate. The challenge is clear: Crime can only come under full control when criminals—in or out of government—know we’re going to catch them, convict them, and jail them. B. THE ECONOMY Opening the economy is, likewise, a political task. In or der to level the field of competition, we need to dismantle the structure of protectionism and controls, and restructure the monopolies and cartels that operate against public in terest. On the other hand, we must encourage and support Filipino and Philippine-based corporations that have proven their efficiency, competitiveness, and civic consciousness. the critical question is no longer whether we will grow. It is how we can 545 sustain and speed up this process. We have experienced a full year of steady, although unspectacular, growth. In the first three quarters of this administration, our GNP in real terms in creased by an average of 1.3%. This is in deed modest—compared to the galloping growth of our neighbors. But this is no mean achievement, given our crippling power crisis. You gave me powers to break some of the barriers to the construction of generating plants that prolonged the crisis. We, in turn, ploughed through the maze of regulations and opened the gate. Today, new plants are operating and others are under construction. The economy will soon have the power needed for growth. The power crisis is on its way to resolution because of the united actions of Congress and the executive branch. This is where our strength lies, in unity of purpose and harmony of actions. But these alone will not be sufficient for the economy to be strong and resilient for global competition. We the refore also have in troduced reforms to restructure the system in favor of efficiency away from protecting the in efficient. We will continue policies of sound monetary management and containment of public sector deficits to ensure that private sector enterprise will in vest, expand production, generate employment, and realize fair returns, particularly for exporters. As the power crisis eases, and as we carry out structural reforms, the economy should accelerate. The in dicators are in creasingly hopeful, such as: • Inflation went down to 6.7% and in terest rates declined to 10.2% in June. • The for eign exchange rate is at a level that spurs exports. • Gross in ternational reserves were at an all-time high of US$6.7 billion early this year. • Investments registered with the Board of Investments grew by 111% in the first semester compared to the first semester of 1992. But against these, we must admit these undeniable shortcomings: • Revenues of the national government have fallen short of our goals. • Expenditures in public in vestments fell short of programmed levels. • Unemployment and underemployment have been reduced only minimally. 1. The Test of Reforms What must we do so reforms will result in a robust and expanded economy? First and for emost, we must not relent in our campaign to level the field of business competition: Global competitiveness must begin at home. Government will not retreat in its campaign against in jurious monopolies and tax evaders. And so, I ask for the urgent passage of anti-trust and anti- racketeering legislation. Let us recognize that an economy controlled by rent-seekers cannot produce free competition and efficiency. The economy must be open to all who bring in new capital, new knowledge, new ideas, and new levels of efficiency. We must broaden the base of economic participation. Let us, the refore, make this Ninth Congress the in strument to free and democratize our economy. By all means, let us join hands in an economic summit—the sooner, the better. 546 2. The Financial System The in dependent Central Monetary Authority assures us of a new regime of price stability. Opening of the financial system to for eign banks should bring more for eign in vestment and expertise. We have substantially recovered from the balance-of-payments crisis in the mid- eighties. The 1992 commercial bank restructuring package largely put to rest our problem on commercial debt. This year, we reentered the in ternational capital market. Our two bond issues have been oversubscribed—confirming our credit-worthiness and in ternational confidence in our future. But we must be prudent in availing of such credits. Instead, we should turn more to grants, concessional credits, and long-term loans. These will help fund our development projects. In response to recent reports on a supposed change in debt policy, let me state very clearly that it is in our national in terest to maintain our current policy. Let us not risk curtailment of credit flows and cut the lifeline of business and commerce. 3. The Budget I will soon submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of Congress, our proposed budget for 1994— detailing how we in tend to finance our development plan. Our spending plan clearly states our priorities on how to do more with less. We will put the highest priority in those activities that pay the most dividends in productivity and growth. And we must resist the usual temptation to spend merely on what is popular just to win votes. The 1994 budgets should be approved by Congress well before Christmas 1993, well before the lights go on again at that time. 4. Resource Mobilization To meet the requirements of the development plan, we must mobilize resources through greater revenue generation rather than excessive borrowings. We have to in crease revenues to cover current shortfalls and fund public expenditures. Our tax base has been eroded by proliferation of exemptions, in firmities of tax laws, deficiencies in collections, and widespread evasion"

Resource Mobilization To meet the requirements of the development plan, we must mobilize resources through greater revenue generation rather than excessive borrowings. We have to in crease revenues to cover current shortfalls and fund public expenditures. Our tax base has been eroded by proliferation of exemptions, in firmities of tax laws, deficiencies in collections, and widespread evasion. Tax exemptions, while well meant, are of ten abused by the underserving. The revenues lost from the exemptions have escalated from P 3.3 billion in 1986 to P 25 billion in 1992—or two-thirds of the capital budget of the national government for 1993. This amount does not even in clude exemptions which have not been monitored. So let us review existing exemption laws and replace them for those deserving beneficiaries with direct budget support—so that the whole system will be transparent, accountable, and manageable. We also have to cure in firmities in tax laws—such as deductions for married couples with joint in comes. In your last session, this Congress passed laws to strengthen the enforcement powers of our revenue agencies. For these I am truly grateful. 547 I have or dered both Commissioners of Internal Revenue and of Customs to use these powers to go relentlessly after evaders, smugglers, and dishonest collectors. I am convinced that citizens will faithfully comply with their tax obligations if there are no free riders on their backs. But because of existing contractual obligations, the payoff from tax reforms may not be sufficient to finance the needs of development. I the refore ask the support of Congress for a new revenue package for urgent enactment. This will widen the tax base and rationalize the existing structure. Reforms in tax administration must aim to achieve simplicity, uniformity, and efficiency. This is the best way to arrest the present epidemic of tax avoidance and evasion. Growth cannot take place with out some sacrifice from everyone of us. But let us agree that the tax burden must fall heaviest on those who can best bear it. But we must not tax at levels that will become a drag on the economy. Consequently, I also ask your help to tap other public funds in special and trust accounts, such as those of the Philippine Tourism Authority and the duty-free shop, and make these available for our budget program. The law creating the Central Monetary Authority adds to the heavy demands on scarce fiscal resources that cannot be entirely covered by additional tax revenues. For our part, we will accelerate sales of public assets and shares in private corporations, and get government out of the business of the private sector. I the refore ask you to extend the life of the committee on privatization and the asset privatization trust, which otherwise will end this year. I also urge Congress to set guidelines for the Presidential Commission on Good Government in making compromise settlements on ill-gotten wealth cases—on terms fair to the government and only with those who have demonstrated commitment to help in the development of our country. My vision of a tax system is a broad-based one with just a few exemptions and at rates that yield no premium to tax evasion, where all enterprises and citizens carry their equitable share. 5. Promoting Investment Congress has acted quickly—and decisively—on the framework for in vestments. We now have a real opportunity to secure a fair share of the in vestments flowing into the ASEAN region. What is important is that we continue to improve our country’s at tractiveness for in vestments—by emphasizing our comparative advantage. 6. Industry Manufacturing and other in dustrial activities can proceed with greater vigor as the power situation improves in terms of competitiveness and productivity. We will champion exports as the key to sustainable economic growth. 548 And we will redouble our efforts to disperse in dustries to the countryside with emphasis on the small and medium enterprises. The for mer military baselands—which were the cause of so much concern on the departure of the U. S. military—have now become at tractive sites for economic expansion. Subic has become one of our brightest areas for for eign in vestment. Similarly, we have been able to move substantially to transform Clark Air Base and Camp John Hay from calamity areas to growth centers. 7. Agriculture and Agrarian Reform We have identified key production areas [KPAs] for specific commodities—areas where not just soil and climate but also markets are most suitable. For example, if we concentrated on growing rice and corn only where they will best grow, with adequate irrigation we can produce as much grain—as we have been producing on 5 million hectares—on only 2 million hectares. We can then free some 3 million hectares now devoted to marginal rice and corn growing to other uses—to pasture, to aquaculture, and to high-value crops. These efforts in agriculture must be matched by equally resolute efforts at agrarian reform. This reform has been of ten pledged, but only half-heartedly redeemed. My administration has stepped up the pace of the CARP implementation. During this first year, we have acquired, distributed and titled some 382,000 hectares, with nearly a quarter of a million farmers benefited. This is 41% of all land titles distributed by the Department of Agrarian Reform during the last 30 years. But you and I know agrarian reform is more than just the redistribution of land. We have the refore taken decisive steps also to ensure that the land remains productive for farmers. We in creased agricultural support services and livelihood assistance to CARP beneficiaries. We encouraged them to or ganize cooperatives and to take advantage of economies of scale to enhance their productivity"

We encouraged them to or ganize cooperatives and to take advantage of economies of scale to enhance their productivity. Last year we launched 257 agrarian reform communities [ARCs] nationwide—with at least one in each congressional district in the countryside—where farmer-beneficiaries can better feel the impact of localized support services in terms of higher in comes. Our goal is to have 1,000 of these ARCs of progress by 1998. This is not enough, however, for the kind of rural transformation that we seek. We have to conserve agricultural lands. That is why our tax package in cludes a land conversion tax. 549 8. Tourism In to urism, we are beginning to reap dividends from our efforts to improve the country’s image and develop “environment-friendly ecotourism.” Tourist arrivals reached 1.15 million in 1992—up by nearly 200,000 compared to 1991. These generated to urist receipts of some $1.7 billion, an in crease of 30.6% over the previous year’s. Tourism arrangements made with our ASEAN neighbors and new to urism estate development will boost our earnings from this source. 9. Infrastructure Development and Energy In in frastructure, we have requirements long neglected. Our network of roads, bridges, air and sea ports is grossly overloaded and poorly maintained. Since the funding for our in frastructure development needs is immense, I propose the amendment of the Build-Operate-Transfer law to encourage greater participation from private capital. Such participation must now be motivated by risk reward for efficiency and with out the guarantee of government. In energy, the dark time is almost over. By year-end, we shall have added 900 megawatts to the Luzon grid. This should—once and for all—put an end to the brownouts in households in Luzon. By the second half of 1994, we shall have reliable power service for in dustry. In the Visayas, power has been adequate, and projects are on going to be sure that no deficiency occurs. In Mindanao, the National Power Corporation has just announced the complete restoration of power normalcy effective to day. In rural electrification, we have energized 94% of all our to wns and cities, and 63% of our barangays. But we should strive harder so that more of our countrymen shall have electricity. There are bills in Congress which we support to strengthen the NEA to enable it to carry out its mission better. We continue to develop geothermal energy—a competitively priced, in digenous, and environment-friendly option. PNOC’s additional plants between now and 1998 will in crease baseload geothermal capacity by 150%. More geothermal resources must be found. We the refore urge Congress to enact the Geothermal Bill to encourage more exploration. Our development program in power is in deed designed to provide comprehensively for our in dustrial future. 550 C. ENVIRONMENT In the past, many nations—ours in cluded—tried to at tain wealth by with drawing from their ecological capital. We are all now paying dearly to restore what we took out of our for ests in the past. So while we still can, we must seek growth that does not exploit our country’s natural wealth. Thus, we strongly uphold our commitment to the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21—which is the global blueprint for sustainable development. Over the past year, we banned logging in virgin for ests, and restricted harvesting to second- growth timber. We continue to pursue a no-nonsense campaign against illegal loggers. We strictly enforced the in terim guidelines on land use conversion to preserve prime agricultural land. We in itiated the use of low-lead and sulfur-free gasoline. And we closed down Smokey Mountain while providing alternative livelihood options for its residents. Nevertheless, we need to provide an environmental protection outlook on old and new problems. We are the refore submitting new codes covering mining, land management, for estry, and fishery. In addition, we need laws to improve solid waste management and to set up a nationwide potable water program for our communities. D. THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT 1. The Bureaucracy A bureaucracy that is mission-driven, and manned by a well-motivated and in novative workforce, provides the foundation upon which we can pursue our goals vigorously. This is a critical requirement for securing our environment for development—a civil service honest and efficient to facilitate the workings of the free market. One of my first moves was to issue Memorandum Order No. 27, or dering all departments and agencies to eliminate duplication of functions, achieve greater cost-effectiveness, and rechannel resources to priority projects. But our efforts have been hampered by multiple barriers to change—which are, ironically, engraved in the civil service law. Although it was not so in tended, the civil service law sometimes acts as a brake on efforts at reform. 551 It is time we addressed this issue to gether. Give me the authority to reorganize the bureaucracy— and I assure you that we shall achieve the kind of or ganization required for efficient, effective, and quality administration. By the same to ken, let us recognize that an efficient bureaucracy depends on decently paid civil servants. I ask Congress to amend our existing compensation laws—so that government can begin to at tract into and retain talent in the service—especially from among our best and brightest. 2. Administration of Justice I know you are as concerned as I am about our people’s perception of the judiciary. I have said it before and I say it to you again. I have no doubt the majority of our judges are as honest, hardworking, and dedicated as they have solemnly sworn to be. But we cannot permit the erosion of people’s faith in the judiciary, which is the in dispensable third pillar in our democratic system of government"

I have no doubt the majority of our judges are as honest, hardworking, and dedicated as they have solemnly sworn to be. But we cannot permit the erosion of people’s faith in the judiciary, which is the in dispensable third pillar in our democratic system of government. The most urgent problem is how to deal with our clogged dockets, with over 300,000 undecided cases in our Regional Trial Courts alone. And so, in stead of just blaming our judges for the delay, let us find practical ways of helping them along. Thus, I urge the passage of laws which will relieve the Supreme Court of the burden of reviewing decisions of certain administrative agencies. Likewise, the jurisdiction of the municipal trial courts can be broadened. And we should also strengthen the barangay justice system and pass the Legal Education Reform bill and the proposal for an academy for judges and prosecutors. The establishment of this academy is part of our program of professionalizing our prosecution service. One must now pass a qualifying examination as part of the requirements for entry into the national prosecution service. The performance of our prosecutors’ field of fices is now monitored and evaluated on a quarterly basis. For a more focused rehabilitation of our prisoners, we are now reviewing a program to regionalize our prison system, which will also free a vast and valuable asset in Muntinlupa. 3. Local Government The improvement of administration at national level must be matched by a similar advance in local government administration. The expectations are high in our local communities because more resources, powers and responsibilities have been devolved to local governments. But the objectives of the Local Government Code of 1991 will be realized only with the proper use of these powers by local authorities. 552 We need to correct the law so that the mismatches in in ternal revenue allocations and the cost of devolved functions, which have disadvantaged some local government units, will be solved. Effective governance will depend on the harmony of actions between national and local governments as well as among local governments the mselves. Inconsistencies in their respective areas will disrupt day to day affairs of commerce and economic life. Devolved powers have to be exercised judiciously with out conflict with national policies. And the use of resources has to be subject to the same discipline of prudence and accountability. The national government will extend assistance in enhancing the management capabilities of local authorities. E. HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT Development is impossible if it is not people-powered and people-centered. Whenever for eign observers look at our country, their principal wonder is how we have managed to languish in underdevelopment in spite of our tremendous human resources, especially our labor force—their literacy, their competence, their resourcefulness, their high sense of moral values. It is time we fully harnessed this precious asset to bring about greater productivity and social cohesion. 1. Population Policy We have embarked on a clear population policy that recognizes the need to moderate our population growth rate. At 2.3%, it is the highest in our part of the world. This rate of growth impairs our capability to improve our quality of life. It strains both our natural environment and our resources for providing jobs, education, housing, health, and other social services. Government has committed itself squarely to a family planning program based on choice—and with the goal of bringing down the growth rate to under 2% by 1998. For this, education and advocacy are our principal to ols. And we look to partnership with the private sector and nongovernment or ganizations in reaching out to our people. We must achieve an appropriate growth and distribution of our population consistent with sustainable development. We must reduce—and eventually reverse—migration into cities and uplands and the reby check the congestion in our major urban centers and environmental degradation in our uplands. 2. Education Ensuring full and unimpeded access by all to both primary and secondary schools is the most effective way of empowering or dinary people. 553 Education reform must also develop a curriculum strong in science, mathematics, and languages. It must in clude the enhancement of the conditions of teachers—in both their livelihood and their work. V ocational education and technical training should keep to their basic purpose, which is to prepare young people for worthwhile jobs, and to teach new technologies that our economy needs. College- and university-level education should focus on developing competent professionals and on nurturing a culture of scientific excellence. We will expand the public school network to the rural barangays which are still with out public elementary schools, and all municipalities still with out any high school, public or private. All these require fundamental reorientation of our values and a continuing review of our education and training policies. 3. Health Care Of all government public services, we have reason to be proud of our National Health Care Program. For several years now, health care stood high in our people’s esteem because service delivery is sustained and dedicated. We have moved to improve these services further. In particular, government has implemented new policies and programs to in crease life expectancy by extensive immunization, improved nutrition, and environmental sanitation. 4. Housing We look at the housing problem not only as an opportunity to propel economic activity but more as a challenge to alleviate the sad plight of our people in our slum dwellings"

Housing We look at the housing problem not only as an opportunity to propel economic activity but more as a challenge to alleviate the sad plight of our people in our slum dwellings. The challenge is to ensure continued in vestments in low-cost housing through stable financing and by devising new and imaginative arrangements that will maximize the private sector’s role. I will certify to Congress a bill that makes contributions to Pag-IBIG mandatory beyond a certain salary ceiling and taps other sources for socialized housing. This will help raise funds for the housing effort. F. FOREIGN RELATIONS In for eign relations, we too, are striking out in new directions. The visits I have been making to our neighbors are meant to signal the priority we are giving to ASEAN and the larger Asia-Pacific region. 554 With the United States, we are entering a new era based on partnership and cooperation—while further strengthening our relationships with Europe and the countries of the Middle East. Now more than ever, we must place our diplomacy in the service of our economy and our external security. Our for eign missions have focused on at tracting in vestments, developing export markets, promoting to urism; gathering economic in for mation, and facilitating the in flow of development aid. In cooperation with our partners in ASEAN, we are promoting confidence-building measures among the claimants to the disputed areas of the South China Sea. And we are taking part in our cooperative arrangements to advance regional security. In addition to our preferential trade arrangements, we in ASEAN have also come to gether to give our six countries the economic weight, the cultural variety, the talent pool, the technological resilience, and the at tractiveness to in vestors that we need to become a major player in the world. G. FIGHTING POVERTY The central thrust of all our programs is the alleviation of poverty. We must fight poverty in ways that will not merely wait for the economy to develop. We must make sure that growth is broad-based and socially equitable—that growth leaves no social group behind. Particularly vulnerable are our marginalized sectors—subsistence farmers and agricultural workers, marginal fishermen, cultural communities, the elderly, the disabled, the street children, the urban underclass of unskilled workers, squatters, and their families. The economy’s return to growth shall by itself help ease poverty. But we shall also be needing focused, targeted, and specific safety nets for these vulnerable groups. We are the refore partial to policies and programs that encourage community or ganizing to at tain self-reliance for the poor communities. And we will match their self-or ganizing in itiatives with more social expenditures, food and education subsidies, rural credit, and livelihood programs. All of these we should do. We cannot leave our poor to wait for the benefits from economic growth to trickle down to where they are. Toward Self-Sustaining Growth Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: 555 In closing, let me declare that I do believe we have started creating the conditions for self- sustaining growth. We can end once and for all, by our cooperative efforts, the cycles of boom and bust which have characterized our economic performance. But this much we must realize: reform will not come easy. Some reforms may bring difficult adjustments and even hardships before they do any good. The most we can do is to ensure that reforms hurt least our most vulnerable social groups. The ultimate truth is that we cannot afford to fail—in our venture of reform and development. The consequences of failure will be grave. Radical in surgency should never flare up all over again: These last 18 years, it has already cost us 40,000 dead. The roots of Philippine rebellion lie deeply buried in the poverty, in equality, and in justice of our social system; in the in efficiency, corruption, in difference, and arrogance of those in power. Again and again, the violence of rebellion has broken out—in leftist in surgencies, military mutinies, and separatist movements. We cannot keep using force and violence to suppress these outbreaks. We must try to recognize their root causes so that we can apply lasting solutions. To do that, we must understand how far rebels are motivated by people’s frustrations over their in ability to break through the barriers and patterns of oligarchic power that control their lives. Only then can we redress, once and for all, the imbalance in national society between the few who are rich and the many who are poor. Only then can we make economic growth meaningful to the masses of our people. We are at a critical hour in our life as a nation. Depending on how we act, our country shall either prosper or falter. Depending on how well we match our words with deeds, our nation shall enter into its second century dragged down by crisis and factionalism—or raised by achievement and pride. Our history teaches us that the exercise of power must be guided by principle. For power exercised with out principle is ruthless, and principle with out the exercise of power cannot move our nation for ward.

The actor made his first foray into politics in the 1960 s when he clinched the mayoralty in the municipality of San Juan. After serving as Senator, he ascended to power as Vice President. Running under the banner of “Erap para sa Mahirap” in May 1998 national elections, Estrada garnered the presidency by a large margin of votes. The actor-politician faced impeachment proceedings on allegations of corruption. His presidency was short-lived as he was to ppled by the EDSA People Power II Revolution in January 2001. In September 2007, the Sandiganbayan, the anti- graft court, imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua upon Estrada on charges of plunder. He was released from detention when President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo granted him executive clemency on October 25, 2007. President Joseph Estrada started his in augural address by emphasizing that “the day of the Filipino masses” had come after they had “waited long enough for their turn and he was “finally leading them.” Identifying himself with the masses, President Estrada vowed that the welfare of the masses must be his government’s overriding priority. Estrada made a serious commitment to deliver basic services, build roads, and eradicate crimes. The actor-politician vowed to prosecute graft and corruption cases. In concluding his speech, he called upon the Filipino people to make use of the people power “for the people the mselves.” 557 INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA [Delivered at the Quirino Grandstand, Manila on June 30, 1998] Good afternoon. The light is fading, the day is almost over, and yet this late afternoon is the morning of a new day. The day of the Filipino masses. One of their own is finally leading them. The last time I was here at the Quirino grandstand, I was with President Cory Aquino, Cardinal Sin, and other religious leaders and fighters for democracy. We were here with many of you to stand up and be counted as friends of the democracy. Ask yourselves then, how could anyone call me a dictatorial type? The last time I was there, in the old senate building, we were only Twelve — Twelve against a superpower; Twelve against a government under its thumb: Twelve against public opinion: But twelve for the sovereignty and honor of our country. Ask yourselves who has principles. Maybe I felt strongly about getting all the wrong priorities out of the way so we can focus on the right things at once. Maybe I felt that we cannot wait for time to heal our wounds and that we should help along the healing process. 558 Who has been hurt and in sulted than I? I have been hurt, and my mother even more deeply at having to listen to all those in sults against her son in tri-media. I am but human and I don’t want to for give. But I must. And I have. I must work with those who hurt me because we have only one country between us. I must work with them and they must live with me, because every Filipino is needed to meet the challenge of national survival in the regional crisis. If I seemed impatient, it was only for peace. We must put yesterday behind us, so we can work for a brighter to morrow. I did not mean for us to for get the past. I don’t. But I hope we will not let the past get in the way of a future that calls for cooperation to achieve peace and prosperity. Finally, I felt that the common people have waited long enough for their turn, for their day to come. That day is here. And it comes not a moment too soon on the centennial of the birth of Filipino freedom. One hundred years after Kawit, fifty years after in dependence, twelve years after Edsa, and seven years after the rejection of for eign bases, it is now the turn of the masses to experience liberation. We stand in the shadow of those who fought to make us free—free from for eign domination, free from domestic tyranny, free from superpower dictation, free from economic backwardness. We acknowledge a debt of gratitude to Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Aguinaldo, Manuel Quezon, Ramon Magsaysay, Cory Aquino, Fidel Ramos, and the magnificent twelve of the 1991 senate who voted for Filipino sovereignty and honor. These are the men and women who gave birth to the idea of Filipino freedom; who struggled in war to give it recognition; and worked in peace to make it come true. Cory Aquino brought freedom back after it was taken away and Fidel Ramos showed how power should respect the people’s freedom of choice in elections. They also began the slow and difficult work of making freedom more meaningful — not just for the rich but also for the poor who are more but have nothing. 559 It is time. Time to speed up the improvement of the living conditions of the common people. Time for them to have a fairer share of the national wealth they create and a bigger stake in their own country. Some will say we cannot rush these things. First, focus on the economy again. Of course, we must improve the economy"

Some will say we cannot rush these things. First, focus on the economy again. Of course, we must improve the economy. How else can the people’s lives improve? But why not both to gether? Why must economic progress always be at the people’s expense? When it was a question of economic reforms to rebuild business confidence and restore business profits, the reforms were never too fast or too hard, especially for the common people to bear. Six years after Cory Aquino, the foundations of a strong economy were laid. In the six years of the Ramos administration, the economy was paying big dividends to its biggest stockholders. This time, why not to the common people as well, for a change? Must we always measure progress only by the golf courses of the rich? I hope this message will not be taken badly by the rich. It has always been their turn, and it is also their turn again. For it is the priority of my administration to create the environment of peace and or der in which business does well. But, surely, it is time for the masses to enjoy first priority in the programs of the government. As far as resources permit, to the best of our ability and the limit of our energy, we will put a roof over their heads, food on their tables and clothes on their backs. We will educate their children and foster their health. We will bring peace and security, jobs and dignity to their lives. We will put more in frastructure at their service, to multiply their productivity and raise their in comes. But this time things will be different. What wealth will be generated will be more equitably shared. What sacrifices are demanded will be more evenly carried. This much I promise, for every stone of sacrifice you carry, I will carry twice the weight. This I promise the people. You will not be alone again in making sacrifices, and you will not be the last again to enjoy the rewards when they come. I ask the rich to take a share of the sacrifices commensurate with their strength. What each of us carries is not our in dividual burden alone, but the fate of our country that we must all share, and which none of us can escape. 560 While I ask you to share these sacrifices with me, I will not impose any more on you when it comes to my job as president. The job is mine now and I’ll do it. There is no excuse for the spread of crime in any society, unless government is an accomplice. There is no criminal or ganization or criminal activity that can stand up to the government if the government is sincere about stamping it out. We know that the major crimes in this country are committed by hoodlums in uniform. We know they are protected by hoodlums in barong and acquitted by hoodlums in robes. We know that the most damaging crimes against society are not those of petty thieves in rags, but those of economic saboteurs in expensive clothes: the dishonest stockholders, the wheeling dealing businessmen, in fluence-peddlers, price-padders and other crooks in government. I promise to use all the powers of government to stamp out crime, big and small. There will be no excuses and no exceptions. I sent friends to jail before; it was not my fault that the courts let them go. No government is so powerless that it cannot protect its citizens, especially when they are victimized by government agents. No government is so helpless, it cannot prosecute criminals, especially when the criminals are of ficials operating in the open. And the government of a country, where most of the people are hungry, need jobs and lack education, cannot allow its taxes to be stolen or wasted, its assets thrown to friends, the national patrimony conceded to for eigners, and the best opportunities limited only to those who can afford. There are things that a real government, even in the worst economic conditions, can do. This government will do it. Government can stamp out crime, as I tried to do as chairman of the PACC, and as I will do as president of the Republic. This time nobody will clip my powers. Government can provide basic services with out the extra cost of pork barrel or kickback; roads for work; in frastructure for productivity; schools for skills; clinics for health; police for safety, 561 and a lean and mean military machine for national defense. This I promise and I will deliver. I will give you at once a government that works, while we wait for the dividends of yet another round of sacrifice that must fall on your shoulders again. Government cannot afford to feed all the hungry in our country, but it would be a crime if any money for food went to government of ficials and fixers in stead. Government cannot afford to build all the roads that are needed, but it would be a crime to build fewer roads to line more pockets. Government cannot afford to bring back the millions of overseas Filipino workers to jobs and dignity back home, but we shall protect their in terests abroad and their families back home. Government cannot afford to give all the youth the complete education promised by the Constitution, but it would be a crime if any money for education was misspent on in ferior textbooks and substandard classrooms built by pork barrel. I appeal to the coming congress to search its conscience for a way to stand behind me, rather than against me, on the pork barrel issue and find a way to convert pork into tuition subsidies in the public and private schools. These are crimes that I will make it my personal apostolate to punish: —low crimes in the streets by rich or poor alike; —high crimes on Ayala or Binondo; —and graft and corruption throughout the government—executive, legislative and judicial. This early, members of my family are swamped with of fers of funny deals. I will treat all such of fers as evidence for future criminal prosecutions for graft and corruption. I warn these people"

I want to bring peace to our lives and harmony to our society. I want to bring or der to our streets and justice to our in stitutions. I want to impart energy to our economy and more equitableness in the distribution of its fruits. I want every Filipino, rich or poor, to feel that the safest place in the world for him is his own country. And, lastly, I hope to bring all Filipinos to gether so as to achieve that power of common purpose that will enable us to escape the crisis of our region and achieve our centennial dream. Freedom. Freedom from oppression. Yes; but freedom from want also. Freedom from fear and freedom of opportunity. And, of course, freedom for its own sake which is the heart and soul of the Filipino. It was here, one hundred years ago, that Asia sitting in darkness saw the first light of freedom. Share my resolve to make that light shine brighter yet by making our freedom more real for the majority of the people. For the past twelve years, the call has been for people power to defend democracy, advanced economic development and other things. It is time to use that power for the people the mselves. Now, power is with the people; one of their own has made it. Source: Manuel L. Quezon III, 20 Speeches that Moved a Nation (Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, in cooperation with Platypus Publishing, 2002), 98-101. 563 INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HER EXCELLENCY GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO [Delivered at Our Lady of EDSA Shrine, Mandaluyong on January 20, 2001] The in augural address is retrieved from https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/ 2001/01/20/in augural-address-of-president-arroyo-january-20-2001/ Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, popularly referred to as GMA, was a university professor when she joined the government service during the term of President Corazon Aquino. Arroyo carved out a niche in local politics. She clinched a seat in the Senate in 1992 on her first try and was re-elected as Senator, garnering the highest number of votes in the 1995 senatorial elections. In 1998, she won an overwhelming victory in the vice-presidential elections. On January 20, 2001, Vice President Arroyo was in stalled as the new Chief Executive with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Hilario Davide, Jr. administering the oath of of fice to Arroyo. Contrary to her declaration in 2002, she ran in the 2004 presidential elections and received a clear mandate from the electorate to lead the country. President Arroyo opened the in augural address by “humbly accepting Presidency” with “both trepidation and a sense of awe.” In her bid to a build a “new Philippines,” Arroyo in voked the success of EDSA ’86 and EDSA 2001 and the “heroism and sacrifices of the Filipino people” in Bataan and Corregidor. She proceeded to present her program of government. Guided by “four core beliefs,” her administration was resolved to eradicate poverty, raise “moral standards in government and society,” foster a “new politics of party programs and process of dialogue with the people,” and cultivate “work ethic and dignified lifestyle.” She concluded her address by calling upon the Filipino people to support her in constructing “an edifice of peace, progress, and economic stability.” 564 In all humility, I accept the Presidency of the Republic. I do so with both trepidation and a sense of awe. Trepidation, because it is now, as the Good Book says, a time to heal and a time to build. The task is for midable, so I pray that we will all be one – one in our priorities, one in our values and commitments, and one because of Edsa 2001. A sense of awe, because the Filipino has done it again on the hallowed ground of Edsa. People Power and the on eness of will and vision have made a new beginning possible. I cannot but recall at this point, the refore, Ninoy Aquino’s words: “I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino, and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for.” As we break from the past in our quest for a new Philippines, the unity, the Filipino’s sense of history, and his unshakeable faith in the Almighty that prevailed in EDSA ’86 and EDSA 2001 will continue to guide and in spire us. I am certain that Filipinos of unborn generations will look back with pride to EDSA 2001, just as we look back with pride to Mactan, the Katipunan and other revolts, Bataan and Corregidor, and EDSA ’86. I am certain that pride will reign supreme as they recall the heroism and sacrifices and prayers of Jaime Cardinal Sin, for mer Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos, the legislators who fought the good fight in Congress, the leaders whose principles were beyond negotiation, the witnesses in the impeachment trial who did not count the cost of testifying, the youth and students who walked out of their classes to be here at EDSA, the generals in the Armed Forces and the Philippine National Police, and the Filipino out there who stood up to be counted in these troubled times. The Filipino, crises and all, is truly worth living and dying for. Ngunit saan tayo tutungo mula rito? Jose Rizal, the first to articulate selfdetermination in a free society, provides the answer. Rizal counseled the Filipino to lead a life of commitment"

The Filipino, crises and all, is truly worth living and dying for. Ngunit saan tayo tutungo mula rito? Jose Rizal, the first to articulate selfdetermination in a free society, provides the answer. Rizal counseled the Filipino to lead a life of commitment. “He must think national, go beyond self.” “A stone is worthless,” Rizal wrote, “if it is not part of an edifice.” 565 We are the stones, and the Philippines is our edifice. On many occasions I have given my views on what our program of government should be. This is not the time or place to repeat them all. However, I can tell you that they converge on four core beliefs. 1. We must be bold in our national ambitions, so that our challenge must be that within this decade, we will win the fight against poverty. 2. We must improve moral standards in government and society, in or der to provide a strong foundation for good governance. 3. We must change the character of our politics, in or der create fertile ground for true reforms. Our politics of personality and patronage must give way to a new politics of party programs and process of dialogue with the people. 4. Finally, I believe in leadership by example. We should promote solid traits such as work ethic and a dignified lifestyle, matching action to rhetoric, performing rather than grandstanding. The first of my core beliefs pertains to the elimination of poverty. This is our unfinished business from the past. It dates back to the creation of our Republic, whose seeds were sown in the revolution launched in 1896 by the plebeian Andres Bonifacio. It was an unfinished revolution, for to this day, poverty remains our national problem. We need to complete what Andres Bonifacio began. The ultimate solution to poverty has both a political and an economic aspect. Let me first talk about the political aspect. In doing so, I will refer to one of my core beliefs, that of the need for new politics. Politics and political power as traditionally practiced and used in the Philippines are among the roots of the social and economic in equities that characterize our national problems. Thus, to achieve true reforms, we need to outgrow our traditional brand of politics based on patronage and personality. Traditional politics is the politics of the status quo. It is a structural part of our problem. We need to promote a new politics of true party programs and platforms, of an in stitutional process of dialogue with our citizenry. This new politics is the politics of genuine reform. It is a structural part of the solution. 566 We have long accepted the need to level the playing field in business and economics. Now, we must accept the need to level the playing field in politics as well. We have long aspired to be a world class economy. Now, we must also aspire to develop a world class political system, one in tune with the 21 st Century. The world of the 21 st Century that our youth will in herit is truly a new economy, where relentless for ces such as capital market flows and advances in in for mation and communications technology create both peril and opportunity. To tap the opportunities, we need an economic philosophy of transparency and private enterprise, for these are the catalysts that nurture the entrepreneurial spirit to be globally competitive. To extend the opportunities to our rural countryside, we must create a modernized and socially equitable agricultural sector. To address the perils, we must give a social bias to balance our economic development, and these are embodied in safety nets for sectors affected by globalization, and safeguards for our environment. To ensure that our gains are not dissipated through corruption, we must improve moral standards. As we do so, we create fertile ground for good governance based on a sound moral foundation, a philosophy of transparency, and an ethic of effective implementation. Considering the divisions of to day, our commitment will entail a lot of sacrifices among us all, as we work to restore the dignity and preeminence of the Filipino. Join me, the refore, as we begin to tear down the walls that divide. Let us build an edifice of peace, progress, and economic stability. People Power has dramatized the Filipino’s capacity for greatness. People of People Power, I ask for your support and prayers. Together, we will light the healing and cleansing flame. This we owe to the Philippines. This we owe to every Filipino. Thank you and may the Good Lord bless us all. 567 INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES [June 30, 2016, Rizal Ceremonial Hall, Malacañan, Manila] This in augural address is posted at https://www. of ficialgazette. gov. ph/2016/06/30/ in augural-address-of-president-rodrigo-roa-duterte-june-30-2016/ In 1977, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, more commonly known as Digong, was designated as city prosecutor at the City Prosecutor’s Office in Davao City.

No leader, however strong, can succeed at anything of national importance or significance unless he has the support and cooperation of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve. It is the people from whom democratic governments draw strength and this administration is no exception. That is why we have to listen to the murmurings of the people, feel their pulse, supply their needs and for tify their faith and trust in us whom they elected to public of fice. There are many amongst us who advance the assessment that the problems that bedevil our country to day which need to be addressed with urgency, are corruption, both in the high and low echelons of government, criminality in the streets, and the rampant sale of illegal drugs in all strata of Philippine society and the breakdown of law and or der. True, but not absolutely so. For I see these ills as mere symptoms of a virulent social disease that creeps and cuts into the moral fiber of Philippine society. I sense a problem deeper and more serious than any of those ment ioned or all of them put to gether. But of course, it is not to say that we will ignore them because they have to be stopped by all means that the law allows. Erosion of faith and trust in government – that is the real problem that confronts us. Resulting the refrom, I see the erosion of the people’s trust in our country’s leaders; the erosion of faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people’s lives better, safer and healthier. Indeed ours is a problem that dampens the human spirit. But all is not lost. I know that there are those who do not approve of my methods of fighting criminality, the sale and use of illegal drugs and corruption. They say that my methods are unorthodox and verge on the illegal. In response let me say this: I have seen how corruption bled the government of funds, which were allocated for the use in uplifting the poor from the mire that they are in. I have seen how illegal drugs destroyed in dividuals and ruined family relationships. I have seen how criminality, by means all foul, snatched from the in nocent and the unsuspecting, the years and years of accumulated savings. Years of toil and then, suddenly, they are back to where they started. Look at this from that perspective and tell me that I am wrong. 569 In this fight, I ask Congress and the Commission on Human Rights and all others who are similarly situated to allow us a level of governance that is consistent to our mandate. The fight will be relentless and it will be sustained. As a lawyer and a for mer prosecutor, I know the limits of the power and authority of the president. I know what is legal and what is not. My adherence to due process and the rule of law is uncompromising. You mind your work and I will mind mine. [applause and cheers] “Malasakit;” “Tunay na Pagbabago; Tinud-anay (real) nga Kausaban (change)” – these are words which catapulted me to the presidency. These slogans were conceptualized not for the sole purpose of securing the votes of the electorate. “Tinud-anay nga kabag-uhan (real change). Mao kana ang tumong sa at ong pang-gobyerno (this is the direction of our government).” Far from that. These were battle cries articulated by me in behalf of the people hungry for genuine and meaningful change. But the change, if it is to be permanent and significant, must start with us and in us. To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have become our own worst enemies. And we must have the courage and the will to change ourselves. Love of country, subordination of personal in terests to the common good, concern and care for the helpless and the impoverished – these are among the lost and faded values that we seek to recover and revitalize as we commence our journey to wards a better Philippines. The ride will be rough. But come and join me just the same. Together, shoulder to shoulder, let us take the first wobbly steps in this quest. There are two quotations from revered figures that shall serve as the foundation upon which this administration shall be built. “The test of government is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide for those who have little.” – Franklin Delano Roosevelt And from (Abraham) Lincoln I draw this in spiration: “You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong; You cannot help the poor by discouraging the rich; You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer; You cannot further the brotherhood by in citing class hatred among men.” 570 My economic and financial, political policies are contained in those quotations, though couched in general terms. Read between the lines"

      "context": ". But the change, if it is to be permanent and significant, must start with us and in us. To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have become our own worst enemies. And we must have the courage and the will to change ourselves. Love of country, subordination of personal in terests to the common good, concern and care for the helpless and the impoverished – these are among the lost and faded values that we seek to recover and revitalize as we commence our journey to wards a better Philippines. The ride will be rough. But come and join me just the same. Together, shoulder to shoulder, let us take the first wobbly steps in this quest. There are two quotations from revered figures that shall serve as the foundation upon which this administration shall be built. “The test of government is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide for those who have little.” – Franklin Delano Roosevelt And from (Abraham) Lincoln I draw this in spiration: “You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong; You cannot help the poor by discouraging the rich; You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer; You cannot further the brotherhood by in citing class hatred among men.” 570 My economic and financial, political policies are contained in those quotations, though couched in general terms. Read between the lines. I need not go into specifics now. They shall be supplied to you in due time. However, there are certain policies and specifics of which cannot wait for to morrow to be announced. Therefore, I direct all department secretaries and the heads of agencies to reduce requirements and the processing time of all applications, from the submission to the release. I or der all department secretaries and heads of agencies to remove redundant requirements and compliance with one department or agency, shall be accepted as sufficient for all. I or der all department secretaries and heads of agencies to refrain from changing and bending the rules government contracts, transactions and projects already approved and awaiting implementation. Changing the rules when the game is on-going is wrong. I abhor secrecy and in stead advocate transparency in all government contracts, projects and business transactions from submission of proposals to negotiation to perfection and finally, to consummation. Do them and we will work to gether. Do not do them, we will part sooner than later. On the in ternational front and community of nations, let me reiterate that the Republic of the Philippines will honor treaties and in ternational obligations. On the domestic front, my administration is committed to implement all signed peace agreements in step with constitutional and legal reforms. I am elated by the expression of unity among our Moro brothers and leaders, and the response of everyone else to my call for peace. I look for ward to the participation of all other stakeholders, particularly our in digenous peoples, to ensure in clusivity in the peace process. Let me remind in the end of this talk, that I was elected to the presidency to serve the entire country. I was not elected to serve the in terests of any one person or any group or any one class. I serve every one and not only one. That is why I have adapted as an article of faith, the following lines written by someone whose name I could no longer recall. He said: “I have no friends to serve, I have no enemies to harm.” 571 Prescinding there from, I now ask everyone, and I mean everyone, to join me as we embark on this crusade for a better and brighter to morrow. But before I end, let me express the nations, on behalf of the people, our condolences to the Republic of Turkey of what has happened in the place. We of fer our deepest condolences. Why am I here? Hindi kasali ito diyan. The past tense was, I am here because I love my country and I love the people of the Philippines. I am here, why? Because I am ready to start my work for the nation. Thank you and good afternoon. 572 General Debate 75 th Session of the General Assembly Week of 22 September 2020 (Tuesday), General Assembly Hall, New York Theme: “The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.” PHILIPPINE STATEMENT PRESIDENTRODRIGO ROA DUTERTE This of ficial statement is retrieved from file:///C:/Users/joey/Desktop/2020 sep 22- Statement-of-President-Rodrigo-Roa-Duterte-during-the-General-Debate-of- the-75 th-Session-of-the-United-Nations-General-Assembly%20(1). pdf. In 1977, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, more commonly known as Digong, was designated as city prosecutor at the City Prosecutor’s Office in Davao City. His political career began at the local level when President Corazon Aquino appointed him as OIC, Vice Mayor of Davao City in 1986. In 1988, Duterte made his first mayoralty bid and was elected to that position. He had served as mayor for seven terms for more than twenty-two years (22). For waging a fierce battle against criminality, Mayor Duterte was given the epithets ““the Punisher” and “Duterte Harry.” In 1998, Duterte, barred by term-limit from running for the mayoralty post, vied for and won a seat in the 1 st Congressional District of Davao City under 11 th Congress. During the presidential elections of May 9, 2016, Duterte scored a resounding victory. 29 For the first time, President Duterte participated in the virtual 75 th United Nations (UN) General Assembly on September 23, 2020 (Manila time). In his pre- recorded address before the General Debate of the General Assembly, Duterte asserted the 2016 Hague Tribunal’s ruling on the South China Sea: “The Philippines affirms that commitment in the South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award. The Award is now part of in ternational law, beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon.” The President took the opportunity to censure those “in terest groups” that “have weaponized human rights” and the efforts to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, November 11, 2020, h<p://www. philippineshonolulu. org/philippines-honolulu/29 about-the-philippines-honolulu/the-president-25/the-president-7/; Nash Jenkins, Why Did the Philippines Just Elect a Guy Who Jokes About Rape as Its President?, Time, May 10, 2016, h<ps://Lme. com/4324073/rodrigo-duterte- philippines-president-why-elected/ 573 “discredit” the “popularly elected government.” Furthermore, he urged “coordinated in ternational plans and efforts” to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly; Mr. Secretary-General; Heads of state and government; Excellencies: I am honored to address you to day on behalf of the Filipino people on the 75 th anniversary of the United Nations. The in visible enemy that is COVID-19 has brought about an unfamiliar global landscape and unleashed a crisis with out precedent. It is the biggest test the world and the United Nations faced since World War II. While the United Nations has brought relief and hope to so many countries and peoples around the world, it now finds itself saddled by a virus that has taken many lives and wrecked economies and social or der. We are at a crossroads. How we address COVID-19 will define our future. For the Philippines, this means putting up all of the peoples of our united nations at the core of this response. We will need to ask hard and fundamental questions about the vision and mission that the United Nations conceptualized 75 years ago. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we have remained true and faithful to the United Nations’ principles and ideals. Mr. President, in the light of the realities of the present, the Philippines grieves with all of the families all over the world who lost their loved ones to this horrible virus. We extend our heartfelt condolences. We salute all frontliners who put their lives on the line even in countries not their own. So also do we honor and recognize the healthcare professionals who selflessly answered the call to combat the COVID-19 pandemic despite its virulence and unknown characteristics. While each nation has its own strategy in fighting the pandemic, what the world needs are coordinated in ternational plans and efforts to pursue a common purpose. COVID-19 knows no border. It knows no nationality. It knows no race. It knows no gender. It knows no age. It knows no creed. 574 The Philippines values the role that the United Nations plays in its fight against the pandemic. As a middle-in come country whose economic advances have been derailed by the pandemic, we welcome the launch of the UN COVID Response and Recovery Fund. Ensuring universal access to anti COVID-19 technologies and products is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery. The world is in the race to find a safe and effective vaccine. When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor with held. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy. The Philippines joins our partners in the ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this. We call for a global health agenda with enough resources and policy space for the World Health Organization. We need a WHO that is quick to coordinate and quicker to respond. The Philippines will do its part in the pooling of global resources. Our health workers are among the best. Mr. President, just as we needed stability and confidence because of the pandemic, geopolitical tensions continue to rise. Escalating tensions benefit no one. New flashpoints heighten fears and tend to tear peoples apart. When elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled flat. Given the size and military might of the contenders, we can only imagine and be aghast at the terrible toll on human life and property that shall be in flicted if the “word war” deteriorates into a real war of nuclear weapons and missiles. I the refore call on the stakeholders in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East and Africa: if we cannot be friends as yet, then in God’s name, let us not hate each other too much. I heard it once said, and I say it to myself in complete agreement. Mr. President: Filipino migrant workers have been devastated by the pandemic. Many have lost not only their livelihood, but also their health and lives as well. Yet they go on in the frontlines, healing, caring for others in the different parts of the world. 575 The Philippine Government has embarked on an unprecedented repatriation program. More than 345,000 overseas Filipino workers needed to come home then. We have brought back half and are bringing back the rest. We thank the countries that have provided Filipino migrants with residence permits, access to testing, treatment and related health services in this pandemic. We brought back most of our seafarers who were stranded because of COVID- 19 restrictions. We pioneered with the IMO the Green Lane for safe changes of seafaring crews. In these times, we need stronger cooperation in promoting and protecting the rights of migrants, regardless of their migrant status. We must all adhere to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Unless states in clude all migrants in their response to this pandemic, “no one among us is safe, until everyone is safe”, as the Secretary-General has said. With the poverty rate reduced at 16.6 percent; and a sustained economic growth rate of 6.4 percent between 2010 and 2019, the Philippines was on track to becoming an upper-middle in come country by the end of 2020. But the pandemic has placed our economy in recession. Despite this downward pressure on growth, the Philippines remains committed to the Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. President: The same urgency needed to fight COVID-19 is needed to address the climate crisis. This is a global challenge that has worsened existing in equalities and vulnerabilities from within and between nations. Climate change has worsened the ravages of the pandemic. Peoples in developing countries like the Philippines suffer the most. We cannot afford to suffer more. The Philippines joined the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. We call on all parties, especially those who have not made good their commitment to fight climate change, to honor the same. We call on all parties to strengthen communities and peoples for preparedness and resilience. We are talking about mankind and Earth, our one and only home. Mr. President: The Philippines will continue to protect the human rights of its people, especially from the scourge of illegal drugs, criminality, and terrorism"

Mr. President: The Philippines will continue to protect the human rights of its people, especially from the scourge of illegal drugs, criminality, and terrorism. 576 A number of in terest groups have weaponized human rights; some well- meaning, others ill- in tentioned. They at tempt to discredit the functioning in stitutions and mechanisms of a democratic country and a popularly elected government which in its last two years, still enjoy the same widespread approval and support. These detractors pass the mselves off as human rights advocates while preying on the most vulnerable humans; even using children as soldiers or human shields in encounters. Even schools are not spared from their malevolence and anti-government propaganda. They hide their misdeeds under the blanket of human rights but the blood oozes through. To move for ward, open dialogue and constructive engagement with the United Nations is the key. But these must be done in full respect of the principles of objectivity, non- in terference, non- selectivity and genuine dialogue. These are the fundamental bases for productive in ternational cooperation on human rights. Mr. President: Terrorism looms large. As I said at the Aqaba Process, the Philippines will do everything and partner with anyone who would sincerely desire to protect the in nocent from terrorism in all its manifestations. The Marawi siege, where for eign terrorist fighters took part, taught us that an effective legal framework is crucial. Our 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act shores up the legal framework by focusing on both terrorism and the usual reckless response to it. Its enactment was done pursuant to our commitment, and the strict adherence to the relevant Security Council resolutions and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Most importantly, we remain committed to rebuild stricken communities and address the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism in my country. We must remain mindful of our obligations and commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and as amplified by the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes. The Philippines affirms that commitment in the South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award. 577 The Award is now part of in ternational law, beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon. We firmly reject at tempts to undermine it. We welcome the in creasing number of states that have come in support of the award and what it stands for — the triumph of reason over rashness, of law over disorder, of amity over ambition. This – as it should - is the majesty of the law. Mr. President: The global health crisis has further complicated the global security environment. But no aspiration nor ambition can justify the use of weapons that destroy in discriminately and completely. There is no excuse for deaths that a nuclear war could cause nor the reckless use of chemical and biological weapons that can cause mass destruction. These weapons of death put us all at mortal risk, especially if they fall in the hands of terrorists with out a shred of humanity in their souls. We call on all Member States to fully implement the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the Chemicaand the Biological Weapons Conventions. I have asked the Philippine Senate to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Importantly, we were among those to sign it first. Mr. President: The Philippines has a long history of opening its doors to the refugees – from the White Russians following the 1917 Revolution, the European Jews in the Second World War, the Vietnamese in the late 1960 s, and the Iranians displaced by the 1979 revolution, among others. The Philippines continues to honor this humanitarian tradition in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. But lest we for get: helping the most vulnerable – those displaced by conflict, persecution, and political in stability – is a shared responsibility of all countries. As I have said many times: The doors of the Philippines are open, as they have always been, to everyone fleeing for safety, such as the Rohingyas. In the face of a mounting refugee crisis worldwide, let us work to gether to wards ending the conflicts and conditions that force people to flee their homes. Mr. President: As our societies become more diverse yet in terdependent, social cohesion issues come to the fore. 578 Mutual understanding always accompanied by mutual to lerance between those of different faiths and cultures is the only foundation of societies at peace with itself and all others. Finally, I express gratitude to the gallant peacekeepers, in cluding our own, who advance the cause of peace in the most difficult situations. From the Golan Heights in the Middle East to Liberia in West Africa, Filipino peacekeepers put the mselves in the frontlines between the vulnerable and those who seek harm. We are committed to in creasing the Philippine footprint in UN peacekeeping operations with in creased participation of women. Again Mr. President: To defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, we must work with seamless unity which demands complete mutual trust and the conviction that we will win or lose to gether. We cannot bring back the dead but we can spare the living; and we can build back better, healthier, and more prosperous and just societies. To this end, we rededicate ourselves to multilateralism. The UN remains humanity’s essential Organization. But it is only as effective as we make it. To make significant changes, we need to be bold. We need the same collective courage that finally made the United Nations a reality 75 years ago"

Born into an affluent political family, Maria Corazon Cojuangco Aquino, popularly called Cory Aquino, was married to Senator Benigno Simeon Aquino, Jr., a vehement critic of President Ferdinand Marcos. Describing herself as a “plain housewife,” Cory Aquino, began her foray into politics in 1986 when she heeded the strong popular clamor to join the presidential race in the February snap elections called by President Marcos if only to deflect the growing local and in ternational pressure and criticism and confirm that he had the support of the Filipino people. Cory Aquino ascended to power in the immediate aftermath of the bloodless and non-violent People Power Revolution. The revolution marked the demise of the authoritarian regime and restoration of democracy in the country. President Aquino signed Proclamation no. 3 on March 25, 1986 to facilitate the “or derly transition to a Government under a New Constitution” and to guarantee human rights and freedom of the Filipino people. By virtue of this proclamation, a Provisional Constitution, also called Freedom Constitution, was promulgated. The Preamble recognized the “mandate of the people,” and presented the circumstances of the in stallation of the government. The Constitution repealed some of the provisions of the 1973 Constitution, among which were the abolition of the National Assembly and Office of the Prime Minister and vested the President with extensive powers. With the dissolution of the National Assembly, the Constitution authorized the President to exercise legislative power “until a legislature is elected and convened.” Furthermore, the Provisional Constitution empowered the President to exercise “control” and “general supervision over all local governments.” As stipulated in Article V, the President was mandated to 580 appoint a Commission “to draft a New Constitution” over a span of sixty (60) days. WHEREAS, the new government was in stalled through a direct exercise of the power of the Filipino people assisted by units of the New Armed Forces of the Philippines; WHEREAS, the heroic action of the people was done in defiance of the provisions of the 1973 Constitution, as amended; WHEREAS, the direct mandate of the people as manifested by their extraordinary action demands the complete reorganization of the government, restoration of democracy, protection of basic rights, rebuilding of confidence in the entire government system, eradication of graft and corruption, restoration of peace and or der, maintenance of the supremacy of civilian authority over the military, and the transition to government under a New Constitution in the shortest time possible; WHEREAS, during the period of transition to a New Constitution it must be guaranteed that the government will respect basic human rights and fundamental freedoms; WHEREFORE, I, CORAZON C. AQUINO, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the power vested in me by the sovereign mandate of the people; do hereby promulgate the following Constitution: PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES ARTICLE 1 ADOPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE 1973 CONSTITUTION, AS AMENDED SECTION 1.

Describing herself as a “plain housewife,” Cory Aquino, began her foray into politics in 1986 when she heeded the strong popular clamor to join the presidential race in the February snap elections called by President Marcos if only to deflect the growing local and in ternational pressure and criticism and confirm that he had the support of the Filipino people. Cory Aquino ascended to power in the immediate aftermath of the bloodless and non-violent People Power Revolution. The revolution marked the demise of the authoritarian regime and restoration of democracy in the country.

When Corazon Aquino clinched the presidency, Aquino named Ramos as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and later as Secretary of National Defense. Supported by President Aquino, Ramos was catapulted to power, defeating Agrarian Reform Secretary, Miriam Defensor Santiago, by a narrow margin. Addressing the delegates to the 20 th Philippine Business Conference of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President Ramos welcomed the ratification of the URUGUAY ROUND of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), saying that the Uruguay Round “is an issue worthy of our undivided at tention and urgent deliberation. Speaking of the rudiments of the GATT, Ramos noted that the removal of the barriers to trade could make world trade “more transparent and efficient.” Ramos had a deep conviction that the Philippines stood to benefit from the trade agreement. As the president allayed the fears that the Philippine membership in GATT could cripple its “agriculture and in dustries,” he admitted that there were certain sectors that would be greatly affected by the agreement and recognized that as the leader of the country, he was duty-bound to “ease their plight and help them at tain more secure positions in our economic life.” Ratifying the Uruguay Round The world will not wait for us 618 THE URUGUAY ROUND (UR) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which awaits ratification by the parliaments and legislatures of the world—in cluding our own—is an issue worthy of our undivided at tention and urgent deliberation. On the first day of 1995, depending on the decision of the members of the GATT, the world will enter into a new trade or der or remain moored to the system of closed-door trading blocs and economically in efficient commerce that it has to day. Unless the Uruguay Round agreement is ratified this year, the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will oversee the new trade or der, cannot open for business as planned next year. Worse, if the agreement is not ratified this year, it could mean, as many have suggested, the closing of this window of opportunity for the world economy. A critical time for GATT Let us be clear about what is at stake—for our country and for the world—in this great issue. When GATT members signed the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh last April, they ended seven and a half years of difficult negotiations. The length of the negotiations suggests the complexity and import of the agreement. It is nothing less than a great landmark in the world’s journey to ward freer and more open trade among nations. Reduced to its essentials, the Uruguay Round aspires to improve and stabilize in ternational regulations for the exchange of goods and services among countries, making world trade transactions more transparent and efficient. The 118 countries that negotiated this agreement are the movers of more than 90 percent of world trade. Under the agreement, trading uncertainties in the form of arbitrary tariff rates, unduly protective or even unnecessary quotas, and other nontariff barriers are reduced. World trade then becomes more predictable and transparent for those countries that abide by GATT rules. Member- countries could then efficiently plan and implement policies and programs to rationalize their marketing and in vestment activities. Second, the Uruguay Round provides for in the World Trade Organization a fitting successor to GATT. The WTO will have the mandate to face the challenge of ensuring a predictable, fair and growth-in ducing multilateral trading system for many years to come, and minimize, if not eliminate, bilateral and unilateral trade action, which smaller nations can and do encounter from their richer trading partners. Benefits of GATT In deciding whether to ratify the new agreement or not, I fully agree that we must examine carefully the implications on our economy of joining this new trade or der. This Administration, 619 in collaboration with the leaders of Congress and the business sector, has been doing that since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. And we are to tally convinced that the Philippines must ratify this agreement because of the benefits and advantages that it confers upon our endeavors to achieve growth and development. The most conservative estimate of the gain from the proposed new trade or der puts it in itially at $200 billion, or roughly 1 percent of gross world product. This would not be enormously significant in itself, were it not that in a developing country like the Philippines, we stand specifically to in crease our exports as we are given more access to in ternational markets. This will trigger a cycle of in crease in demand leading to higher in comes and expanded employment—two objectives that have been difficult to achieve with out greater and freer trade. We see here a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in which our determined push to ward modernization will be matched by a comprehensive lowering of trade barriers in the global trading community. The Uruguay Round achieved a global lowering of tariffs of at least 33 percent, for certain products of particular in terest to the Philippines. The reductions are even greater—with as much as 50 percent to 100 percent cuts in the tariff barriers of our major trading partners like the United States, the European Union and Japan in such Philippine products as toys, furniture and electronics. Effects for the Philippines We have already been able to determine that the tariff reductions pledged by our trading partners will practically apply to the full array of Philippine export products, which in 1993 amounted to almost $12 billion. Upon the full implementation of the Uruguay Round results by the year 2000, our exports can in crease by an additional $2.2 billion to $42.7 billion every year"

Upon the full implementation of the Uruguay Round results by the year 2000, our exports can in crease by an additional $2.2 billion to $42.7 billion every year. That would be on top of the natural in crease in exports that we experience through time. In terms of money alone, these gains are enormous. In terms of helping to develop our country, they are even more significant. We cannot allow this opportunity to pass us by. There are some among us who spread fear that under this new GATT, our country will be deluged by cheap imports, resulting in the death of our agriculture and in dustries. They see the agreement as a plot of the developed nations to keep the developing nations for ever poor and dependent. 620 They still fancy that we can develop with out in tegrating ourselves to the global economy, with out opening our doors to for eign in vestment. In their fantasy, the Philippines can in dustrialize by itself, with the State as the engine of development. The ideology that spreads this fear has long been discredited because it has proved bankrupt and unworkable. You cannot imagine a starker illustration of Socialism’s failure than the spectacle of for mer Communist countries trying to erect market economies. Neither do we need further proof of the poverty of economic ultranationalism and protectionism than our so-called in fant in dustries that have remained in fants after 40 years of protection. Dealing with the challenge That there are some sectors in our country that will be adversely affected by the new GATT is of course true. Though their difficulties are no argument against trade reform, we, the leaders, have a clear duty to ease their plight and help them at tain more secure positions in our economic life. We can deal with this challenge so long as we do not transform it into what it is not. To begin with, our country did not commit to reduce tariffs in the Uruguay Round, except in the case of 66 products which at present have high tariffs of 30 percent to 50 percent. These 66 products constitute less than one percent of the almost 5,600 products that we import. The reductions in the 66 products, which cover agricultural and textile products, will be at the rate of 10 percent to 60 percent spread out over ten years. The Philippines only committed not to raise the tariffs on 2,800 products, or half of the 5,600 products that we import beyond a level that is 10-percentage points higher than the currently applied tariff. Quantitative import restrictions on agricultural products, like corn and meat products, will be lifted and replaced by very high tariffs. This is the process called tariffication. The Uruguay Round allows us to continue importing what we have normally imported in the past, and permits us to levy a much higher tariff in case we need to import more than historical imports. The process will the refore not be destabilizing for our farmers. Let us take the case of corn. If there is demand, we can import the 130,000 metric tons a year we imported in the past at a tariff of 35 percent. Anything beyond that volume, we import at 100 percent. Over ten years, we in crease the volume to 217,000 metric tons, and reduce the high tariff of 100 percent to 50 percent by the year 2004. This method not only gradually liberalizes our corn market but also in troduces predictability, and the refore sound decision-making in the corn-using sector such as hogs and poultry producers, and even the corn in dustry itself. Where under the old system our hogs and poultry raisers did not know if there would be any importation of corn, now they will know that there should be at least 130,000 metric tons at 35 percent, and anything beyond that at 100 percent. The corn 621 in dustry as well can make its calculations—it will know just how much landed imports will cost and decide on in vestments and expansion programs in a more scientific way. Rice, the most important agricultural crop, will be temporarily exempt from tariffication. The Philippines will be able to continue the restriction on rice imports, but we will have to lift these restrictions by the year 2005. In exchange for this flexibility, however, we should allow minimum importations during the ten-year in terim period of around 59,000 metric tons in 1995 if there is demand, rising to 236,000 metric tons by the year 2003, at a tariff rate of 50 percent. These volumes represent 1 percent and 4 percent of domestic consumption, respectively, which are lower than the 3 percent and 5 percent of domestic consumption we would have been required to commit had we opted to tariffy rice. We have no obligation to import rice beyond the minimum volume. The Department of Agriculture, in coordination with the legislature, is about to complete the mechanism for the importation of these minimum volumes with a view to plowing back the proceeds to the farm sector through the putting up of additional in frastructure and postharvest facilities. The garment in dustry will continue to benefit from expanding quotas for the next ten years. Both Government and the private sector should use this long transition period to put in place adjustment measures that would improve the competitiveness of Philippine garments in terms of price, quality and turnaround time. Spurring us to do better The textile in dustry will also undergo a modernization program to improve its competitiveness and provide the foundation for the garment in dustry. That is the rationale for Executive Order 204, which I signed in September. It in tends to bring down tariffs on the in dustry’s in puts, raw materials, capital equipment, and even finished goods, to levels that would be low enough to get the modernization program started, and to discourage smuggling"

Without doubt, the Uruguay Round is bound to impact on our country’s protection structure—but the process would be over time and not be immediate. Fears that the agreement will kill domestic in dustries and agriculture are to tally unfounded. The process allows our in dustries and farm sector adequate time to adjust and develop their capabilities and improve efficiency. Thus we can be competitive in the global trading game. Confidence and hard work will see us through. Protection did nothing to raise our productivity as a nation. I firmly believe that the challenge of economic survival in a competitive global economy can only spur us to do better. The issue of subsidies 622 The agriculture agreement of the Uruguay Round signals the beginning of the end to rampant subsidies for agricultural products. Subsidies give undue advantage to for eign products that, on one hand, cannot compete with products the Philippines exports to the world market, and on the other, compete unfairly with Filipino farmers in the domestic market. In the developed countries, domestic agriculture subsidies shall be reduced by 20 percent over six years; export subsidies shall be reduced by 36 percent in volume trends and by 21 percent in value terms over six years. These reduction rates actually become deeper when one takes into account that the subsidy cuts will be applied on 1986-88 subsidy levels and not on 1994 figures. Even our richer ASEAN neighbors will have to effect some reductions in their domestic agricultural subsidies. This should be a boon to our farm sector. In the area of in dustrial subsidies, until our per capita GNP reaches $1,000, the Philippines will be one of the few remaining countries in East Asia that can continue to use subsidies and in centives that are based on export performance. Once that threshold in come level is reached, we would still have eight years to phase out such subsidies. In contrast, our neighbors in East Asia and most of our ASEAN neighbors are already phasing out such subsidies. Subsidies and in centives that require the use of local in puts over imported ones (or local content requirements), however, will have to be phased out by the year 1999. This may have an impact on say, the vehicle manufacturing programs. But here, as in the other areas, what will be lost over time will be of benefit to Filipino consumers. The Philippines also stands to gain from the multilateral trading rules that were agreed on in the Uruguay Round, because we can use them to protect our legitimate trading in terests. These rules in clude safeguards to allow us to protect our domestic in dustries against a surge in imports. Antidumping and countervailing duties to neutralize unfair imports, and those that harmonize trade measures which in the absence of harmonization can become trade barriers, such as technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, rules of or igin and customs valuation. The agreement on trade-related aspects of in tellectual property rights will require us to improve existing rules to protect in tellectual property rights (IPRs) and to ensure their effective enforcement. The Philippines, however, when compared to other countries in Asia, already has a fairly well-developed legislative structure for IPR protection; hence the adjustments will not be substantial. The IPR agreement can benefit the Philippines in sofar as it will encourage the in flow of for eign in vestment into the country, and we will no longer be vulnerable to unilateral pressure from certain countries. 623 The First World’s fears It is one of the ironies of the GATT debate that while some of us here are fantasizing that the agreement is a Western conspiracy to keep poor nations poor and dependent, there are those in the West who believe that it will siphon off output and jobs from them to the poor nations. The truth is the rich countries have more anxiety problems about the new agreement than the developing countries. Developing nations have been quicker to get on board than the developed nations. What is happening is that people in rich countries are now fretting about the success of developing countries, and no longer about their poverty. Manufactured goods now account for almost 60 percent of developing-country exports, up from 5 percent in 1955. The Third World’s share of world exports of manufactures jumped from 5 percent in 1970 to 22 percent in 1993. Many politicians and businessmen in America and Europe fear that the success of these new competitors in the world economy will come at their expense. They contend that the lowering of trade barriers under the Uruguay Round will just feed this process. They spread the fear that the rich world’s workers will be ruthlessly undercut if its markets are opened to goods from developing countries. They are wrong, just as our ultranationalists are wrong. Trade is not a zero-sum game where any in crease in one country’s output must be at the expense of another’s. Turning opportunity into reality Put at the simplest level, greater access to rich countries will enable poor countries to export and develop faster. But in creased exports enable developing countries to spend more on imports such as capital equipment and branded consumer goods from developed economies. An in crease in output in a poor country is likely to in crease output in rich countries and vice-versa. They can feed each other under a regime of freer trade. Moreover, freer trade is not just beneficial on its own terms: it also binds countries’ in terests to gether"

This finally is what the new GATT is all about. And this is why virtually all economists believe that it will sharply in crease world domestic product and create jobs in millions. This is not to say that everybody will automatically be a winner under the envisioned new trade or der or that everyone will be a winner in the same way. 624 The greatest rewards will still belong to those countries that are quick to adjust and seize the opportunities. In our case, we must see this as an opportunity to double export revenues and in dustrialize by the turn of the century. Thus we must ensure that the economic environment in the Philippines will be favorable for meeting this challenge. We must achieve greater competitiveness not only in the world market but also in the domestic market. For this to be possible, the costs of doing business have to be brought down. Measures to further bring down in flation and the in terest rate to levels prevailing among our ASEAN neighbors must be implemented. We need a policy that promotes a competitive peso. Infrastructure must be put in place to reliably support the energy, transport and communication needs of in dustry and agriculture. The education system and science and technology-or iented programs have to be pushed to assure that we will have the human resources to match the growing global need for in novative and efficiently produced goods. These policy reform imperatives and support measures are in the Ramos Administration’s action plan for gait adjustment measures and budgetary support so that they can catch up with and share in the future benefits of the accord. The proposed 1995 General Appropriations Act has been tailored to support UR-GATT requirements for the immediate future. The writing on the wall You of the private sector in turn must hold up your end of the sky. Philippine corporate culture, or enterprise if you prefer, must take to heart that to survive, one must be competitive. The private sector must operate under the assumption that protection accorded by Government through trade barriers will in creasingly diminish in the years to come especially in light of developments in the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. The writing, as they say, is on the wall. But it is the writing that will end our “sick man” status— it is the writing that of fers enormous rewards to the resourceful, the imaginative and the enterprising.

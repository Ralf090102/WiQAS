      "context": "Page 29 2 Thought and Religion TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER, the Philippines is an overwhelmingly Christian country. The country’s apparent uniformity, however, obscures the complexity and uniqueness of its religious life. Though overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the nation’s religious diversity also in cludes two major in digenous Christian churches, the Muslim population of the southern islands, and minority peoples scattered throughout the archipelago. Beyond questions of religious affiliation, Filipino religious thought has an immediacy based on a perceived close relationship between the supernatural and daily human life that is uniquely Asian and is not present to the same degree in the religious ment ality of Western Christians. This perceived relationship predated Islam and Christianity and actually guided the process whereby these world religions were selectively adopted and domesticated. As a result, much of Philippine religion can thus be called “folk,” since many beliefs are at variance with strict in terpretations of the adopted religions. Despite the Roman Catholic church’s predominance, the twentieth century witnessed the emergence of two substantial in digenous churches, the nationalistic Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI, or Philippine Independent Church) and the rapidly growing Iglesia ni Cristo (INC, or Church of Christ). Still other Filipinos have shifted their allegiance to a variety of mainline Protestant churches and the Mormon church. Even within the Roman Catholic church the semiautonomous charismatic El Shaddai movement claims eight million members, and its dynamic leader Mariano “Brother Mike” Velarde frequently upstages the for mal church leadership.

In addition to reviewing the country’s contemporary religious landscape, this chapter examines in digenous Philippine beliefs and the process by which Page 30 they modified the world religions of Christianity and Islam. The political role of religion in the Philippine’s historical context is reviewed to show how Filipinos have connected religion and politics. As the in stitutional religion of the colonizer, the Roman Catholic church played a key role in affairs of state and later in the development of Philippine nationalism. Though relatively quiescent during the American colonial period, the church has recently returned to its earlier tradition of political in volvement and played a leading role in the overthrow of the Marcos regime in 1986. Even to day, different churches and movements are heavily in volved in questions in volving the political destiny of the country and how modern, largely American, notions of democracy, egalitarianism, and social justice will be adopted to the local scene. CONCEPTS OF NATURE AND THE SUPERNATURAL Until the arrival of Islam in the latter years of the fourteenth century, the Philippines had remained peripheral to major Asian religions, although some archeological evidence of Hindu in fluence has been discovered in the southern islands. Instead, the dominant religious characteristic of the archipelago’s scattered communities was animism (the worship of spirits in nature) and deism (a vague belief in numerous gods). While known by a variety of names, the islands’ in habitants generally believed in the dominance of a single powerful deity supplemented by a pantheon of lesser gods and an active spirit world. One of the earliest Spanish priest chroniclers wrote that the Tagalogs spoke of Bathala as their principle god, while other peoples around the archipelago had other terms for this same concept of an all­powerful deity"

One of the earliest Spanish priest chroniclers wrote that the Tagalogs spoke of Bathala as their principle god, while other peoples around the archipelago had other terms for this same concept of an all­powerful deity. Since this supreme god was remote and in accessible, his powers and presence was complemented by lesser deities to whom Filipinos made of ferings and prayers to gain immediate benefits. The most common of these lesser deities were the anitos, who were usually good if properly appropriated. The anitos could be the spirits of deceased ancestors who were supplicated in exchange for help in times of stress. Other anitos were spirits who lived in special natural objects such as old majestic trees, powerful rivers, or awe­in spiring rock outcroppings. Sacrifices were also made to these spirits to gain favor and to ward off any angry in fluence. Sometimes idols or images were crafted to represent these spirits, and the images then gained supernatural power as a result of their representation of the spirit reality. Even to day, images in Roman Catholic churches are sometimes said to be in vested with special powers and have miraculous stories ascribed to them that are reminiscent of the tales accredited to images of Page 31 anitos. It is to the anitos that the farmer will make a small sacrifice as he prepares his fields for planting and to which other people will of fer small gifts for any of a number of specific requests or occasions.

The asuang is usually a nocturnal creature and is responsible for a variety of evil activities, in cluding at tacks on pregnant women, people out alone at night, and the sick. The asuang are variously vampires, viscera­suckers, weredogs, ghouls, or witches and can take a variety of forms, such as that of a beautiful woman who will lure a man to his demise. Their existence performs the social function of explaining otherwise confounding issues of the unknown associated with illness, miscarriages, and death. Numerous Filipinos from a range of social­economic backgrounds readily talk about their own sighting of one or another of these creatures. When either plagued by an of fended anito or at tacked by an asuang, the victim might seek relief either from the local expert in medicine, the herbolario, or the local shaman who will perform a seance in an at tempt to find the means necessary to placate the asuang.1 These ceremonies are still practiced among Philippine minority hill tribes. In the mountains of Zambales province, most ceremonies were held in the evening after the day’s work. The shaman, who was frequently an elderly woman, would dance in a rapid spinning motion to the rhythm of a guitar until eventually collapsing to the floor at which time she would speak in to ngues. The seance would result in a command by the aggrieved spirit, speaking through the shaman, that the afflicted human had to obey before relief would be granted. On rare occasions, much more elaborate ceremonies were held that could take as many as three days"

These would be community events and required the continuous feeding of guests, ritual dancing, and chants and of ferings to placate the angered spirit, whether anito or asuang.2 The Filipino concept of the natural and the supernatural worlds and one’s relationship to them is thus immediate, since the trees and rock outcroppings in one’s own community may house powerful spirits. Furthermore, because one’s own ancestors might be anitos, there is a heightened sense of in timacy in the Filipino’s relationship to the hereafter. Most of ten, the supernatural world is benign as long as the spirits are appropriated with suitable prayers and of ferings that are given for a variety of reasons. It is only the asuang who constitutes a deadly threat and of ten cannot be controlled, since they act capriciously and cannot be appropriated by the usual of ferings and social Page 32 techniques.

A “FOLK”CHRISTIAN COUNTRY IN ASIA Christianity came to the Philippines as the religion of the conqueror and clashed with the in fluence of Islam in the south and the beliefs of non­Islamic Filipinos throughout the rest of the country.

In fact, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of religion during the Philippine colonial experience as it shaped the nation’s culture and political life. Missionary priests accompanied Miguel Lopez Legaspi’s founding expedition in 1565, and soon priests had spread throughout the hinterlands to bring the local population into the Roman Catholic community. A clear in dication of the importance of the Spanish missionary impulse is found in the annual subsidy that the government of Madrid provided for the maintenance of parish priests. In turn, the priests became de facto representatives for the Spanish crown and supervised the affairs of to wns throughout the colony. Just as missionary parish priests were the true authority figures at the local level, so too were their superiors in Manila the masters of the colony. Because Spanish civil of ficials rotated in and out of of fice with some regularity, their knowledge of the country’s political life was sketchy, especially when compared to that of a long resident and politically savvy head of a monastic or der. It was not very long, the refore, before the heads of the monastic or ders were considerably more powerful than many of the king’s own appointed representatives. Early in the Spanish colonial period, a few governor­generals at tempted to operate in dependently of monastic approval and were very sorry for the experience. As well, on four different occasions when a new governor had not arrived from Spain, or was otherwise absent, the archbishop of Manila actually served as the in terim governor. Thus, whether at the local or national level, the monastic or ders had a unique degree of political importance far beyond what might have been expected"

The missionary priest, for example, would try to make the concept of the Christian God familiar to the local population and used the name Bathala, the Filipino name for a powerful god. The local population hearing Bathala would imagine that the priest was referring to their local god and saw no in consistency in at tending a mass on Sunday even while retaining their earlier beliefs. Thus, no matter how rigorously the priest might at tempt to end beliefs in pre­existing gods and supernatural beings, the Filipino response to the missionary enterprise became a complex layering of both submission and resistance.3 Filipino Catholics conceptualized the Christian God as a wise and powerful peasant father and the Virgin as an ever­in dulgent mother while Christ as savior was the personal link to the remote father figure. As a personal savior who sacrificed his own life and who continues to give favors (puhunan), Christ was owed a perpetual debt of gratitude (utang na loob) that is so great that it can never be repaid. In the face of such enormous power, the Filipino cleaved to the worship of saints, the apostles and martyrs, and even of local natives who had led exemplary lives. Sometimes this worship led to clashes with the church that views any such worship outside the hierarchy’s control as heresy. Meanwhile, the church building became the representation of authority, with the priest as the spokesperson and the human medium to the spiritual world. The mass in Latin was as mysterious as the shaman’s speaking in to ngues, and communion at mass served as the link to the blood life force of the remote God. Recitations of the pasyon (the story of the life and death of Christ) at Easter, and even brutal acts of flagellation, became a way for the believer to enter into a direct relationship with Christ"

From the colony’s founding until the French Enlightenment reached Spain during the Bourbon monarchy in the mid­eighteenth century, the missionary priests, or friars, were unchallenged. At that time, approximately threefourths, and virtually all of the best and wealthiest, of the country’s parishes were held by the friars. Meanwhile, native clerics and Spanish secular priests (priests who were not members of one of the monastic or ders and who reported directly to diocesan bishops) were given the poorest of parishes in remote locations. The Bourbon kings made a sincere effort to train as many Filipinos as possible to become members of the secular priesthood, but this in itiative floundered because it was pushed too fast, and many of the new priests were so in capable that the program became discredited. Later, by the early decades of the nineteenth century after Spain lost much of its colonial Page 35 empire in the Americas, criticism of Filipino priests took on distinctive racist to nes supplemented by expressions of an ill­defined fear that native priests would become the leaders of an anti­Spanish nationalist revolution. The in creasingly virulent anti­Filipino at titudes held by the Spanish clerics became a self­fulfilling prophecy, although not in quite the manner that the friars feared.

By 1871, only 181 of the country’s 792 parishes were under the control of mestizo and native in dio priests, and religion had become the focal point of the earliest forms of an emergent nationalism.4 Because of the ostracism heaped upon the Filipino in dios and even the mestizos, it was among these abused priests that concepts of national and racial identity were most sharply brought into focus. Events took a tragic but defining turn in 1872 when three prominent Filipino priests, Fathers Jose Burgos, Jacinto Zamora, and Mariano Gomez, were executed for their alleged role in a mutiny by native troops assigned to the Spanish naval station in Cavite along the shore of Manila Bay southeast of the capital. There is little doubt of their in nocence of the charges brought against them by Spanish authorities who were searching for scapegoats and for a reason to silence these articulate leaders of the Filipino priests. But much more important was the impact that their executions had on the young educated elite Filipinos of the period, the ilustrados, in cluding Jose Rizal.

The text of the story is sung in houses, not just in church, and is a shared communal activity because of the length of the story.

While accepted by many Filipinos, the separation doctrine ran counter to deeply in grained Spanish practices and could not be implemented overnight, which sometimes led to clashes between Roman Catholics and adherents of the nationalistic church, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, founded by Father Aglipay in 1902.7 In response to its losses, the Roman Catholic church reintroduced as many missionary priests as it could from a number of countries, especially the United States, even as it sought to affirm the loyalty of as many of its native priests as possible. A vigorous program to train Filipinos for the priesthood was begun in an at tempt to make up for centuries of Spanish neglect. This strategy soon had an impact, and in 1907, the first Filipino was in vested with the robes of a bishop. Despite this massive effort, the country still had to depend upon for eign priests for many decades. While there was somewhat less than 1,000 parishes for a Philippine population of approximately seven and a half million at the turn of the century, the population and the number of parishes grew rapidly during the American colonial period and after.

Indigenous Christian Churches Primary among mainstream in digenous religious movements is Father Aglipay’s church, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) which in a real sense was the fruition of the friar prejudice against Filipinos, especially the native priests. The IFI’s roots were planted in a bedrock reaction against the execution of the three martyr priests in 1872 and were nurtured in the soil of Philippine nationalism. In the spiritual vacuum created by the for ced and abrupt departure of the Spanish friars, the schism grew rapidly, especially Page 38 because in its earliest days the new church made no claim to a radical the ology but simply separated the Philippine church from the authority of Rome. While most native priests were hesitant to affiliate with the schismatic movement and feared being accused of heresy, Aglipay was joined by some clerics, especially those from his native region of the Ilocano provinces to the north. The schism then spread rapidly across the nation with centers in various areas of Luzon, in the islands of Iloilo and Negros in the Visayas, and in a scattering of to wns on other islands in cluding Mindanao. Only the Bicol area of Luzon, that long arm extending far to the southeast, remained relatively free of the schism"

The schism then spread rapidly across the nation with centers in various areas of Luzon, in the islands of Iloilo and Negros in the Visayas, and in a scattering of to wns on other islands in cluding Mindanao. Only the Bicol area of Luzon, that long arm extending far to the southeast, remained relatively free of the schism. Aglipay was also supported by a number of secular nationalist leaders who had been in volved in the failed fight against the United States, so the IFI became a conduit channeling the smoldering embers of the lost nationalist cause. Soon, however, the new church in troduced practices within the culture’s folk tradition, such as for mally making Jose Rizal and the three martyr priests from 1872 saints of the new church. To this day, nationalist icons of various sorts are displayed in many IFI churches. Also problematic was its later publication of an of ficial book of doctrine that made statements of beliefs that were at distinct variance with established Roman Catholic the ology. Yet, in its first days, the biggest problem for the new church was training a sufficient number of priests rapidly enough in new seminaries to supply the demand. In this sense, the in digenous church and its Roman Catholic rival shared the problem of a scarcity of qualified priests. Census records from 1903 are vague on the question of popular religious affiliation, and estimates of the growth of the schism vary widely from one and a half to three million. In fact, the true figure might have been at some midpoint between the two claims as in dicated by the next census made in 1918. By this time, the IFI was in serious decline after losing the legal right to occupy the country’s churches that had been abandoned by the Spanish priests.

Over time Father Aglipay’s personal the ological beliefs became identified with Unitarianism even while the majority of his priests and followers remained firmly in the Roman Catholic tradition.

A second in digenous Christian church is the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) founded in 1914 by Felix Manalo, a man who led an extremely in teresting and varied religious life. Born in 1886, Manalo was raised Roman Catholic, but his poor parents could not afford to give him much of an education. He could, however, read the Bible, which led him to question the consistency with which Catholicism preached its message. Manalo then joined a Colorum peasant religious group until discovering that the supposed voice of God was really only that of the group’s leader. Under the open religious at mosphere of American colonialism, Manalo joined a succession of Protestant churches beginning in 1904 with the Methodist Episcopal Church, then the Presbyterian church, which he left in 1909 to enter the Disciples of Christ in America, where he was in troduced to the practice of baptism by immersion, a practice of the INC to day. Two years later, he became a member of the Seventh Day Adventists, but he soon had as many doubts about this sect as he had with the others. Finally, in 1913 he began to preach his own religion to whoever would listen, and the following year he for mally in corporated his religious or ganization.

By 1920, he had assembled a small group of followers plus a few fellow priests, and he proclaimed himself to be an “angel of revelation” sent by God.8 He also came to the conclusion that Jesus Christ was not a deity, but was only a man, even if a very special one, who was the head and savior of his church. In addition, he stressed that the only true source of religious knowledge was found in the Bible and that anything that did not come from the Bible had to be false. He, the refore, rejected the worship of images and the veneration of saints as pagan appropriations of the Roman Catholic church. So, too, was the practice of confession and the belief in purgatory eliminated from the INC’s doctrine. Page 40 However, Manalo did stress that salvation could only come to those who joined his church, since his was the true church created by Christ from which the Roman Catholic church severed itself.9 Until the Second World War, the INC expanded slowly from one province to another from its Manila roots. The conversion process was usually aided by a member who converted while living in the national capital and then brought the new religion back to his home province with the assistance of one of Manalo’s missionary priests. The church expanded and gradually established a credible national network even before the Second World War, reaching Cotabato province in Mindanao in 1941.

By the late 1960 s, a number of young Filipino priests led by Fathers Edicio de la Torre and Luis Jalandoni began to raise serious questions about the meaning of the priesthood and its social role that went far beyond issues of development and questioned the structure of the Philippine social or der.12 It should be noted that while some in the Catholic church were moving in this radical direction, the nation’s youth were also becoming more socially aware and beginning to critique the country’s ine­ Page 42 qualities.

While conservative elements in the hierarchy cautioned restraint, the more socially active and critical members of the church were not long in criticizing the regime.13 Leading the way was the Association of Major Religious Superiors and its Task Force on Detainees, which was created to monitor the rapidly deteriorating human rights condition under the martial regime.

In death, Aquino rose from being Marcos’s principle political enemy to a martyr of folk proportions, gaining a permanent place in the country’s pantheon of national heroes. His widow, Corazon Aquino, is an extremely devout Catholic whose piety in the face of her personal tragedy captured the imagination of the nation. She was cast in the role of the grieving Mary Magdalene whose calm opposition to the Marcos evil in stantly lifted her high above the usual elite politics.

Normally non­confrontational Filipinos, in cluding almost all the country’s seminary students and many of its priests and nuns, volunteered to protect ballot boxes.

Homestead land grants were of fered to Christian Filipinos willing to resettle to Mindanao, and large tracts of cheap agricultural property were sold to agricultural corporations. By the 1950 s, as a result of these government programs, Mindanao had a majority Christian population who controlled the social and economic life of the island and the region.18 Then, in 1968, an alleged massacre of thirty Muslim soldiers on Corregidor Island for a supposed mutiny was the spark needed to in flame a revolt.

When President Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Philippine troops were countered by a large and well­trained army of Muslim adversaries who were fighting for their religion and way of life. In the ensuing struggle, MNLF guerrilla tactics soon bogged down the technologically superior Philippine army. The government was eventually able to use divisions among the Muslims to disintensify the movement and sign a weak peace agreement with the MNLF in 1982. Nevertheless, the resistance movement has continued and even grown under the in fluence of fundamentalist religious revivalism currently sweeping the Islamic world. As a result, even the use of the word “Moro” for the separatist struggle is important because it comes from the dismissive Spanish term “Moor” used to belittle Muslim Filipinos. The idea is to adopt the derisive terms of the oppressors and turn them into terms of liberation. Many young Muslim clerics (ulemas) have studied at Al­Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, famous for its in fluence on Islamic reform, and their message is now spreading among the faithful. A number of Islamic religious schools (madrasas) for children have been built thanks to support from Saudi Arabia, and these serve as an alternative to the government’s secular public schools. More young Filipino Muslims are going on the annual hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca) than ever before, and Muslim scholars and teachers are in cluding the Philippines in their itineraries. As a result of this religious resurgence, a Page 46 new, more radical political leadership is beginning to emerge. Even older conservative and secularist Muslim leaders must now appear in traditional clothing for ceremonial occasions and adopt some of the new rhetoric. Ironically, in terms of gender relations, the separatist struggle has actually in creased the active role that Muslim women play in their society"

Ironically, in terms of gender relations, the separatist struggle has actually in creased the active role that Muslim women play in their society. Whether women will continue to enjoy autonomy as peace returns and religious strictures in crease is open to question.19 Despite the appearance of being an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation, the Philippines has a remarkable degree of religious diversity, with an underlayer of earlier in digenous beliefs that have moderated the in trusions of world religions. Further complicating the religious picture is the political nature of religion, since both Christianity and Islam have entered with a political mandate, and their political as well as religious agendas have shaped events and religious in stitutions. This latter point is especially apparent in the twentieth­century creation of the two major domestic Christian churches. NOTES 1.

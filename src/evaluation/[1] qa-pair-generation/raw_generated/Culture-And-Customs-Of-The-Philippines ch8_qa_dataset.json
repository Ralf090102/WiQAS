Even so­called mainstream contemporary popular Philippine music and dance forms are complex blends of many in fluences, both in digenous and imported. In their pure form in digenous dances, and the music that accompanies them, has been maintained by numerous ethnic groups who escaped the direct impact of Spanish and American colonialism and whose geographically remote location has helped them sustain traditional dance styles and musical in struments down to the present time. Even the Tagalog people, the country’s principle ethnic group, have kept alive pre­Spanish music. So, for example, the Tagalog kundiman is perhaps the best known in digenous Filipino musical form and it combines the lyricism with lulling tempos that are evocative of Italian melodies. The kundiman is a love song that can be tender and sweet, sometimes passionate, and occasionally even gloomy, but it is always expressive of Filipino life. Meanwhile, Spanish musicality and the numerous European dances they in troduced still thrive in such for ums as rondalla groups (string in strument ensembles) in to wns around the country. Their music is standard fare during annual town fiestas and other festive occasions, along with graceful Iberian folk dances. Similarly, near pure forms of American jazz, ballads, folk, rock, and alternative music can be heard on the archipelago’s televisions and radio stations and in urban nightclubs. In fact, the ability of Filipino musicians to master American in strumental and vocal styles has made them famous throughout Asia.

INDIGENOUS MUSIC AND DANCE Pre­Hispanic Philippine music and dance traditions are still maintained by the ethnic groups of the central Cordillera region of northern Luzon, the in habitants of remote areas of the Visayan Islands, and the Islamic and pre Islamic peoples of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. These people have a song or a dance for every occasion, in cluding secular activities and religious rituals. So, for example, there are songs for birth, childhood, adolescence, courtship, marriage, work, storytelling and joking, teaching, blessing a new house, recounting heroic exploits, curing illness, and burying the dead. The Tingyans of Abra province in northern Luzon sing their daleleng at festivities and the salagintok to express friendship and love, while the Bontok of the central Cordillera have the ayegkha as an evening song or serenade and the annoay to accompany the mselves while building their world famous rice terraces.

Music plays an important role in the social life of the Muslim peoples of the south and also in their religious life, such as the Tausog’s luguh maulud, which celebrates the birth of Mohammed.1 Although singing styles vary from group to group, there are common patterns that emerge whether the singing is solo or by a group. Many songs are improvised and the quality of a performer is of ten judged by his or her ability to create new lyrics for each song. These are songs that are frequently sung by a couple who are courting or by friends who are gently joking each other. Songs are not limited to specific lyrics or time lengths and can expand as needed. As well, since everyone is expected to sing, there is a great range of vocal quality. The impromptu social nature of musical participation has survived in contemporary Filipino society and frequently catches a for eign visitor by surprise when they are suddenly asked to entertain a group with a song. The for eigner is usually concerned about the quality of their performance, but that is not as important to Filipinos as a person’s willing to participate in the shared group activity. Most singers will overcome their sometimes Page 175 limited range of notes by adding pitches, sounds, trills, tremolos, and other devices to add variety to their performances. While singing unaccompanied is quite common, Philippine in digenous music also employs a number of in struments made of bamboo, brass, wood, animal skins, and other natural materials.

All Filipinos have a variety of dances appropriate to work activities associated with rice culture, hunting or fishing, and with daily mundane tasks, in cluding fetching water, spinning, and basket making. It is also common to use dance for courting, since flirtations can be conducted relatively safely via a dance used to approach and gauge the receptivity of a potential mate. This safety is further in creased in dances that mimic the courtship movements of animals, especially the rooster and hen.

Music was especially important for the proselytizing efforts of missionary Roman Catholic priests, who used music and song to teach the native population about Jesus Christ and the church’s saints and doctrines. Children were raised singing in choruses in the newly built Page 177 churches after the scattered population had been relocated within “the sound of the bells,” and the young singers were effective agents in spreading the priests’ message. By the early seventeenth century, Franciscan and Augustinian missionaries had created a number of boys choirs and founded a seminary to train hundreds of boys in religious music. A little over one hundred years later, a full conservatory of music was established in Manila, and missionaries of the Recollect or der set up a school for or gan builders. The early years of the nineteenth century even saw the construction of a large church or gan constructed entirely of bamboo in the town of Las Pinas, located in to day’s Rizal province southeast of Manila. After falling into disrepair, the or gan was restored in the early 1960 s and is a popular to urist at traction.

Spanish religious music did make its way into a number of Philippine festivities associated with saints that developed in dependent of priestly supervision. As well, there are religious processions during Easter that are in dependent of church control, and the practice of pamamasko, or Christmas caroling, is frequently employed as a fundraising effort for nonreligious civic activities.5 In addition to religious music, the Spanish colonial period also saw the in troduction of European secular music and dance. Although secular music dispersed more slowly than the missionary­sponsored hymns and songs of religious praise, profane music embedded itself deeply in the national culture because of its association with dance. A common observation by visitors in the late nineteenth century and in the first years of the American period was the frequency with which Filipinos loved to hold a baile (dance party). In the days before electricity, entertainment was only found in the at rical performances or occasional religious celebrations.

In the more relaxed at mosphere of the latter nineteenth century, new forms of music and dance, in cluding jotas, the bolero, or habanera, became common as did the paso doble, the balse (waltz), the fandango, the Polish mazurka, the for mal square dance from France called the rigodon, and even the polka. Interestingly, many European music and dance forms were modified when adopted by Filipino society. So, for example, the habanera became the more subdued Filipino dansa that eventually transformed to in clude the music of the harana, a serenade of courtship. Meanwhile, the in digenous song and Page 178 dance debate form was expanded to in clude the gay and lilting manner of the jota, a Spanish folk dance and music. This dance was modified in the town of Moncada in Tarlac province and became known as the jota moncadena. The waltz was modified into different styles of which the carinosa courtship variation was especially popular, and the for mal rigodon soon became the lanceros and closely resembled the American square dance. The fandango, or pandanggo, became modified into a wide variety of dances in cluding one where the woman balances one oil lamp on her head and two more on the backs of each hand while executing complicated cross­ over steps. The European polka was in troduced by the Spanish ladies and gentlemen of Manila, and soon many Filipino folk songs were fitted into the new dance, which became known as the polkabal, a favorite activity in many provincial cities and to wns.

In particular, the moro­moros and the comedias of the Spanish colonial period helped the in troduction of martial march music, just as the sarsuela promoted the harana and the development of the in digenous kundiman of the Tagalog provinces. New ensembles of European in struments accompanied the in troduction of this new music, most especially the rondalla and the comparza, which were made up of stringed in struments, such as the mandolin as well as the piccolo, bandurria, laud, octavina, guitar, bandola, and the bajo de unas. Also gaining in status and importance was the piano.

At the request of Andres Bonifacio, founder of the revolutionary Katipunan society, Julio Nakpil wrote the first national anthem, and he and other Filipino composers soon wrote a number of patriotic marches for the nationalist cause. Especially notable was the “Marcha Nacional” by Julian Felipe, which has since become the national anthem. The kundiman also served the turn­of­the­century revolutionary cause by speaking of patriotism of country even though expressing these feelings allegorically by singing of romantic love. So, for example, the Page 179 Music sheet of Constantion de Guzman’s 1928 nationalistic kundiman Bayan Ko, with lyrics by Jose Corazon de Jesus.

AMERICAN SONG AND DANCE If the Spanish colonial period broadened Filipino music by in fusions from Europe, the American occupation of the country in 1898 in troduced a flood of cultural in fluences that in cluded revolutionary new forms of music. Every musical development from the profound to the most superficial that or iginated in the United States was soon reflected in the Philippines. The music of dance bands, ragtime, blues, jazz, swing, boogie woogie, and, in the post World War II period, rock and roll, folk, alternative, and rap were all mastered by Filipino composers and musicians. Unlike the Spanish, who in troduced European music for religious purposes, but did not actively promote either secular music or social dancing among Filipinos, Americans enjoyed these pastimes and were more than willing to share their rhythmic wealth with their new colonial wards. In the early years, nightclubs, cabarets, and musical variety shows called bodabil (Filipino for “vaudeville” ) were soon in full swing, and Filipino musicians found work and an appreciative audience. From early vaudeville on ward, new dances such as tap dancing, buck­and wing, cakewalk, skirt dance, Charleston, foxtrot, Lindy hop, cha­cha, and mambo made it into the Philippine popular repertoire.

Filipinos quickly and enthusiastically adopted this veritable flood of American culture and music. So rapid was this acculturation process that it seemed likely to destroy the Philippine’s musical culture that had survived hundreds of years of Spanish colonial rule by slowly and carefully assimilating the new in fluences. By the 1920 s, the sarsuela and traveling the at rical companies with their Filipinized versions of European music forms had all but vanished, and young musicians seemed more in terested in learning new jazz tunes from Chicago than traditional awits and kundiman classics. But Filipino culture proved too strong and resilient to succumb entirely to the American juggernaut. The development of the Philippine film in dustry, for example, provided young musicians and composers with profitable outlets for their work. The songs and music associated with the sarsuela survived thanks to Filipino films that used works by local composers. Songs such as Miguel Velarde, Jr.’s “Dahil Sa Iyo” (Because of You), Simplicio Suarez’s “Ikaw pa Rin” (It Is Always You), and Constancio de Guzman’s “Langit ang Magmahal” (Heaven Page 181 Is to Love) are just a few of the many movie tunes that later moved into the mainstream.

Important at the beginning of the twentieth century was the rondalla, which first appeared during the preceding Spanish era. Under the direction of Antonio J.

Thanks to postgraduate work in Chicago, Nicanor Abelardo was the first to break from the classical romantic tradition and in troduce “modern music,” but even his music never veered too far from Philippine folk melodies and tunes. He wrote numerous awit, kumintang, and kundiman pieces even as he searched for a new form at Philippine music.

Some of the music of the depression­era Philippines was directed at youth and women: “Gumising Ka Kabataan” (“Wake Up, Youth”) and “Babaeng Page 185 Walang Kibo” (“Passive Woman”). The lyrics of many of these songs were rather heavy handed, but subtle use was made of traditional musical forms to elicit feelings of sorrow or tenderness. The abrasive nature of these 1930 s lyrics were greatly modified during the Second World War when the Philippine Communist and Socialist parties merged and for med an anti­Japanese guerrilla force, commonly known as the Hukbalahap or Huks. Now, music and skits were designed to at tract support from the peasantry, and the lyricism of the past became more sophisticated. One memorable song from the war period was “Ing Bie Ding Anac Mu, Balen Cung Alipan” (“The Life of Your Child, My Enslaved Country”), whose lyrics had a broad appeal. In its postwar fight against the newly in dependent Philippine government, the guerrillas continued to use song as a part of their arsenal to counter claims of national disloyalty. Such was the rationale for the song “Gintong Catimauan” (“Golden Freedom”) that denied allegations of banditry while making the claim that their cause was just.

So, for example, the protest songs of the 1930 s were revived and occasionally rewritten to make their messages current, and the beautiful kundiman “Bayan Ko,” with its slow and melodious cadence, was revived and sung in defiance of Marcos’s Metrocom troops, who seemed to enjoy wielding their truncheons on student bodies. A poem by 1896 revolutionary leader Andres Bonifacio, Pag­ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa (Love of One’s Native Country) was performed in a kundiman form and became extremely popular. Still, other than these two songs, most protest music of the era was too martial and energetic to become popular beyond a limited number of dedicated activists. Once adopted by professional musicians, protest music had a significant impact on mainstream Filipino music.

Record companies also joined in with the release of a small flood of compilation albums of Filipino music.18 ETHNIC AND MODERN DANCE Ethnic and traditional dance is a major Philippine cultural export, but it might not have been so had it not been for the for esighted program of University of the Philippines president Jorge Bocobo to preserve the nation’s heritage in music and dance. Especially diligent in responding to Bocobo’s call was dance in structor Francisca Reyes Aquino, who began her work in Page 190 1931 in cooperation with composer Antonio Buenaventura. She eventually compiled a six­volume sourcebook from her extensive travels throughout the country, and these provided a core of in for mation upon which others could build. Meanwhile, a number of other people made more specialized studies of the dance traditions of various regions of the country. While completing her authoritative body of descriptive knowledge about the country’s folk dances, Aquino also founded the University of the Philippines Folk Song Dance Club in 1937 and a dance troupe and a national society for dance teachers. In 1947, another dynamic woman, Paz Cielo Belmonte of the Philippine Normal College, began the Barangay Dance Company, which also presented dances that were ethnographically faithful to the or iginals.19 A major change was in itiated by yet another woman, Leonor Orosa Goquingco, who founded the Filipinescas Dance Company in 1957. Her importance was not as a strict preservationist. Rather, Orosa was a choreographer, and she took the ethnographic dances and brought them to life on stage for modern urban audiences"

Rather, Orosa was a choreographer, and she took the ethnographic dances and brought them to life on stage for modern urban audiences. Orosa’s many productions, such as her epic five­part story of the Philippines, Filipinescas: Philippine Life, Legend and Lore in Dance, went beyond simple displays of ethnic dances and used techniques of ballet and modern dance to in terpret and express the life experience of the Philippine people.20 Also in 1957, another young woman, Lucrecia Reyes­Urtula, became the first choreographer of the Bayanihan Dance Company of the Philippine Women’s University. After less than one year, the troupe went on its first tour and won rare accolades at the Brussels World Exposition. Under Urtula’s guidance, the Bayanihan has always concentrated on remaining true to or iginal dances even while stylizing them for modern audiences. To this end, Urtula continued the work of Aquino by traveling around the country to discover and document Philippine dances. Together with composer Lucrecia Kasilag, Urtula’s for mula has worked wonders on numerous in ternational to urs as well as for home audiences, in cluding a three­year tour held in conjunction with the centennial.21 The Bayanihan has also been responsible for spawning the careers of a number of dancers, some of whom have gone on to start new dance companies, such as Ramon Obusan, who founded his own Folkloric Group in 1972, or have become choreographers and have further developed the country’s wealth of folk dance materials. As a for eign importation, classical ballet made its mark during the American period thanks to visitors from Europe and the United States.

Under her direction, Page 191 the company not only performed many classical ballets, in cluding The Nutcracker, but also in tegrated Philippine folklore and historical the mes into visually stunning performances. Fortunately, the Philippines has a broad community of talented artists, choreographers, dancers, and composers to support modern dance, and it is upon these people that a successful performance ultimately depends.22 Philippine modern dance also retains its relevance for contemporary society by making social commentary, such as Basilio’s 1984 Misa Filipina, which was a stylized representation of the assassination of Benigno Aquino. Meanwhile, choreographer Douglas Nierras’s group, Powerdance, uses a dance style and accompanying music of chants, jazz, and rock that aims at the MTV generation and the bakya audience. His the mes in clude humorous looks at street life, marital relationships, and the plight of domestic laborers. A truly amazing young troupe of dancers is the Teatro Silencio, whose members are all deaf and who feel the music’s beat through vibrations in the floor on which they perform. In 1997, the group traveled to Paris to represent the Philippines at the World Youth Day, where they impressed their audience and received excellent reviews.23 NOTES 1.

      "context": "Page 119 6 Marriage, Family, and Gender THE FILIPINO FAMILY plays a more central role in the lives of its members, and in the nation’s greater social and political life, than do families in many other cultures. To a significant degree the Filipino gains his or her sense of identity and self­worth from family membership despite the social impact of contemporary urban culture, which places in creasing emphasis on the in dividual, and even in the face of sometimes competing friendships and associations outside the family circle. A basic reality of Philippine society is that one’s family is as in timately linked with an in dividual’s social status as is material wealth, while social, economic, and political success, especially in small to wns and villages, is in large part contingent on the size and strength of one’s family. THE FILIPINO BILATERAL FAMILY The importance of the family in Philippine society is especially noteworthy when one considers that the Filipino family is structurally similar to families in other cultures, such as the United States, where there is an emphasis on the in dividual rather than the family. Like its American counterpart, the basic Filipino family unit is composed of the husband, wife, and their children biological and/or adopted. In addition, the Filipino kinship structure is “bilateral,” meaning that one’s relatives are calculated to in clude in dividuals from both the father’s and the mother’s families. In the bilateral family structure one’s relatives and descendants from both sides of the family are respected and treated equally.1 One’s affinity to a relative is more a matter of variables, such as proximity and frequency of contact, affinity, and calculated Page 120 mutual benefits, such as favoring your rich uncle, than of socially defined relationship"

In the bilateral family structure one’s relatives and descendants from both sides of the family are respected and treated equally.1 One’s affinity to a relative is more a matter of variables, such as proximity and frequency of contact, affinity, and calculated Page 120 mutual benefits, such as favoring your rich uncle, than of socially defined relationship. The basic egalitarian nature of Filipino kinship is readily seen in the nongender specific nature of kin terms in which there is only one word for spouse (asawa), son or daughter (anak), sibling (kapatid), cousin (pinsan), parent­in­law (biyenan), and so forth. If the in dividual’s gender needs to be in dicated, the extra words for male (na lalaki) or female (na babae) must be added. As well, the process of choosing a marriage partner is relatively in for mal and not restricted by family lineage rules so that choices are frequently left to the marriageable son or daughter. For their part, while parents may let their son or daughter know who they consider to be an excellent prospect, a primary concern is that a daughter’s future husband can support her and their children, while a son’s future wife should have sufficient domestic skills and good maternal capabilities. Philippine parents do not dictate marriage choices nor are they actively in volved in the selection process by hiring matchmakers or otherwise in terfering. In societies characterized by bilateral kinship structures, not only is marriage and descent calculated along both lines but in heritance can go to daughters, especially unmarried ones, as well as sons. Furthermore, in the bilateral kinship system, a young couple has the option of choosing to live with or in close proximity with either the groom or the bride’s family. Frequently in the Philippine context, the new couple elect to reside in the same house or in the family housing compound as one of the parents until they become economically established and can afford to build their own house"

Additionally, women have the potential to play an active role in the family decision­making process and might even become in volved in activities outside of the home. Visitors have long noted the Filipina’s dynamism and how she is frequently treated more as a partner to her husband than as a subservient appendage doing his bidding. In many respects, then, the bilateral Philippine family contrasts sharply with some other Asian kinship structures that calculate their membership only along a single bloodline, either through the father (patrilineal) or the mother (matrilineal). In a patrilineal society, best exemplified by China’s traditional family structure, the new bride makes a near to tal break from her family and enters into that of her new husband, virtually losing her identity in the process. Marriage choices are also strictly controlled so that couples with similar family names (i. e., the same family lineage) may not marry, and the parents choose their child’s partner, frequently with the help of a professional matchmaker. In the patrilineal family descent, in heritance and power are all located in the male line, while female family members are in a distinctly in ferior position. The wife may control the daily life of the household, and she is responsible for child­raising, but she has no claim to the Page 121 family’s wealth and is subservient to her husband in all matters and decisions.2 In wealthy patrilineal families, there may even be multiple wives and concubines who service the male head of the household"

THE EXTENDED FAMILY What the Filipino family lacks in terms of the strength of the Chinese patrilineal style of kinship descent, it makes up for with its extensive network of actual and fictive relatives. The broad Filipino network of actual relatives is called the “extended family.” In its ideal form, the extended family in cludes all of the nuclear family’s siblings and their children extending outward. Practically speaking, however, the typical extended family usually consists of the immediate brothers and sisters who remain united while their parents are still alive or who continue the relationship due to mutual in terest and benefit. In an everyday sense, the extended family in cludes the nuclear family plus the elder parents who of ten live with one of their children and, perhaps, a few other blood relations, such as a sibling’s family. Beyond the family group residing in the same house, Filipino families will locate their residences in close proximity to each other. Well­to­do extended families will even cohabit a single compound in which all their houses are built. In most cases, however, common residence is simply not possible, especially in the modern urban reality of Manila and other large cities.

Nonetheless, the Filipino family retains its vitality as an extended entity, since visits are made as of ten as possible. As noted in the chapter “Festivals and Entertainment,” a primary function of festivals and religious holidays is to reinforce family bonds. Returning to the hometown for the annual fiesta and Christmas mass, especially when lolo (grandfather) and lola (grandmother) are still alive, is an important vehicle to maintain and renew the extended family’s ties. Beyond ties of affinity, the traditional Filipino family was a source of economic security for its members. This economic function was certainly true in the culture’s rural and agrarian or igins where landownership was the key to survival. Land was usually passed from father to son and sometimes to a daughter and her husband. Families worked the soil to gether sharing the tasks and the rewards. Local power could be in creased by a for tunate marriage of one’s son or daughter to another landowning family, which would benefit both parties. Wealthy families were especially aware of the close connection Page 122 between consanguineal relations and landed wealth and occasionally practiced first­cousin marriage to maintain the family’s ownership of haciendas especially those devoted to the profitable export crop of cane sugar.3 Supplementing the biological extended family is a category of “fictive kin” who are in corporated through ritual relations"

      "context": ". The phenomenon is known in the social science literature as compadrazgo, or ritual co­parenthood, and refers to compadre relations established when these extra familial in dividuals act as sponsors at marriages and, especially, baptisms.4 Between the two ritual events, the marriage sponsor is probably the singularly most important, but since there are far many more baptisms than there are marriages, it is the baptismal relationship that has the greater social importance. Besides, marriage sponsors are usually limited to two sponsors while there is no limit to the number of sponsors that an in dividual can have at a baptism. In any case, the baptismal compadre is always carefully chosen, since the act of standing as the child’s sponsor means much more than a willingness to take on a religious obligation. The sponsor also accepts some responsibility for the child’s general development and welfare and may legitimately be asked to help with things such as education and later employment. The sponsor must, the refore, possess the means to supplement the family resources and already be close enough to the family to be willing to accept a more in tensive relationship with them. One mistaken model of the relationship has the poor rice land tenant seeking to have his landlord become a sponsor at his child’s baptism. In practice most sponsors are at approximately the same social economic level since the families are creating close long­term bonds. A compadre relationship between a tenant and his landlord is usually impractical. The one who is sponsored takes on the role of a son or daughter to the sponsor, and they, in turn, show the sponsor the same respect they give their biological parents"

As well, the sponsored child enjoys a pseudo­sibling relationship with the sponsor’s children and a grandparent­grandchild relationship with the parents of the sponsor.5 Additionally, a sponsorship obligation is reciprocal and the parents/marriage partners are obligated to their kumpadre and kumadre. Asacompadre relationship develops, the in teraction between the parties can become quite close and may actually approach levels of in tensity found among biological siblings. In many in stances, close compadre relationships develop such that it is not uncommon to find them as business partners and political coalition allies. In fact, the basis of the Philippine political alliance system has provincial roots reaching up to the national level that combine regular biological families plus their allies, who in clude their kumpadres.6 While there are in dications that compadrazgo is declining as a social in stitution, the practice still remains an important aspect Page 123 of the greater extended Filipino family and still exerts a tremendous social pressure.7 GENDER SOCIALIZATION AND DATING While the Filipino family structure appears similar to that found in the United States, it is in adolescence when the real differences between Philippine and American family and social practices become dramatically clear.

American women might also feel restricted by standards set for them compared with those that apply to American men, but whatever differences exist in American culture is magnified many times over in the Philippine context. During adolescence even as the body changes and develops in new ways, the sex roles of boys and girls are more defined, with boys being allowed to in dulge in more “adult” practices, such as drinking and even visiting girls, although in the company of other boys. Mixed company is allowed, but serious courtship is not permitted by the young adolescent male. The basic premise is that boys and young men do not fit in the house and take their recreation and form their identity from activities that take place outside the home in the world of men. Thus, the men perform the heavier tasks on the farm and take on additional jobs in local to wns. In urban areas, the men always find employment that takes them outside of the house, and with some exceptions, such as teachers, the gender divisions of employment are as sharply drawn in the urban environment as they are in the rural areas. The guiding premise that men do not work in the house accounts for the young Filipino male’s extreme reluctance to become in volved in household matters and especially to perform common housekeeping tasks of any sort. Later in life, the husband will surrender virtually all control of household affairs to his wife who manages the family budget, raises the children, and plays a strong role in creating social linkages with neighboring households. Instead, the male gains status from his ability as a provider and from his public image in the community.

It is also expected that boys will form extra­familial bonds with other boys in friendship groups known as barkadas. The Philippine barkada can sometimes be mistaken for American adolescent “gangs,” but there is no antisocial or criminal behavior in these groups as is of ten the case in the American context. Rather, the barkada relationship between young men forms a bond that is extremely strong and long lasting and closely regulates the behavior of its members. Within the barkada, the young male learns to sacrifice his Page 124 goals for the greater good of the group, and personal loyalties reach in tense levels. Frequently, a man’s youthful gang­mates remain lifelong friends who can always be counted on in any situation and with out questions being asked.8 The lessons that a young male learns as a member of a barkada have a lasting impact on the young man’s development and follow him through his life, even as he forms similar bonds with other males in other situations, such as work or politics.9 This pattern of male bonding is first developed in the barkadas of one’s youth and affect how men later relate to each other in a wide variety of situations. In college, the fraternity of ten plays the role of the barkada and at the nation’s primier in stitution, the University of the Philippines, “rumbles” between rival fraternity groups are not uncommon and sometimes lead to deadly shoot outs.

This same fraternal bonding is even present in the Philippine military’s of ficer corps where classes of cadets from the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) remain tightly bound and identified throughout their careers in the armed for ces. An excellent example of this continued linkage was seen during the 1986 overthrow of the Marcos regime when many of the reform of ficers who joined the head of the armed for ces, Fidel V. Ramos, and the secretary of national defense, Juan Ponce Enrile, were members of the same PMA class.10 Even as young men are being socialized in activities and groups outside of the home, socially constructed gender specific roles for girls are also in tensified during adolescence, as domestic feminine tasks are passed on from mother to daughter in a more rigorous way than in the games of little girls. Instruction in food preparation and household maintenance take on serious overtones, since it is believed that a girl’s ability to at tract a good future husband is dependent, at least in part, on her domestic skills. Older female children frequently take on the role and authority of a surrogate mother in managing the house and younger siblings. On the farm, young women can participate in work activities outside the home, but these are closely regulated by gender divisions so that a girl will feed the smaller farm animals such as chickens and pigs and will join in planting and harvesting, but she will not plow a field or tend the family’s water buffalo.

Especially in rural communities and among traditional families in urban areas, in teraction with boys must only take place in public and in closely Page 125 regulated circumstances. Spending in or dinate at tention on a boy or young man is not permitted and being alone with him for any length of time is avoided at all cost. The safe assumption that parents make is that every boy will try his luck and that sexual experimentation may happen. If the girl loses her virginity, her marriage possibilities will decline dramatically; a girl of suspect morals is only sought after for sexual favors and not potential marriage. Worse, the girl not only shames herself but she also ruins the family name at the same time. For this reason, chaperones are still used in many rural and traditional families, especially in the evening hours, as adolescents make their first tentative steps to ward adult sexuality. An excellent example of the tentative nature of adolescent sexuality can be seen at public dances held in conjunction with barrio and town fiestas and at school functions. Initial contact is made by the boy as he asks a girl to dance. When he does, the girl is not expected to accept too readily. Instead, she will avoid eye contact and look to her friends, or perhaps a chaperone, to gain approval before taking the boy’s hand. During a slow dance, the couple will stand quite a ways apart from each other with the boy’s hand only just reaching the girl’s waist. She, in turn, stands very stiff as if she is not enjoying the experience. The couple may talk to each other but rarely smile or otherwise in dicate that they might be enjoying each other’s company.

In sharp contrast, if the girl dances with a sibling or other relative or with one of her own female gang mates, she can be much more relaxed, can move in tempo with the rhythm, and can obviously enjoy herself.11 To be fair, this traditional outlook with regard to sexuality by adolescent girls and young women and their in teraction with young men is changing rapidly as the family loses its traditional dominance and ability to control its young people. One factor that must be ment ioned is the broad availability of public education that began during the American colonial period and has accelerated in the post­World War II era. Coeducation has in creased in for mal contacts between boys and girls to such a degree that gender separation seems in creasingly quaint and anachronistic. As well, the barkada’s alternative to family control means that different values and expectations will be brought to bear on young men and women. Most important, though, is the availability of nonagricultural employment that frees both sexes from the economic clout that underlies the strength of traditional familial bonds.

In the urban social environment, little thought is given to young men and women “hanging out” to gether in for mally in groups with little or no parental supervision and even American­style dating by single couples.12 As a result of these changes, even the traditional emphasis on virginity is becoming less important for young men when selecting a mate. Still, young women even in the most open­minded sectors of the country must be careful to maintain a proper image. Dating is still practiced in group situations until a couple has developed a relationship, and even then open sexuality is not common. For example, the American practice of a young couple living to gether before marriage is practically unheard of except among a relatively small number of Manila’s young people. Thus, the Filipino female’s social world remains relatively limited in comparison to that of her male counterpart, who can enhance his reputation by being known as a ladies’ man. The contrast between tradition and modernity becomes more obvious when casual dating escalates into a serious relationship, which then leads to for mal courtship.

COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE In comparison to the American and Chinese social alternatives, the process by which in creasingly modern and urban Filipinos enter into dating and serious courtship seems to align very strongly with the American model. That perception may owe a great deal to the Filipino penchant for unabashed expressions of romantic love and its role in their lives. If one were simply to listen uncritically to popular music, view run­of­the­mill Filipino movies, and read the popular short­story pulp fiction of many magazines and komiks, one’s impression would be that the Filipino is a very passionate person whose romantic life and marriage choices are affected only by affairs of the heart. In fact, romantic love plays an in creasingly important role in courtship and marriage, but not to the degree that a first impression would suggest. A number of traditional considerations, in cluding the active in fluence of the family, still plays an important role in the choice of marriage partners. Serious courtship can begin during adolescence, especially in the country’s rural areas, but family and economic pressures are delaying marriage more now than ever before. This tendency to delay marriage is becoming especially strong as the need for advanced education to in crease the possibility of upward social and economic mobility is in creasingly recognized. Not only are young couples marrying later than before, but many traditional courtship practices have disappeared since the 1950 s. At that time, a number of courting practices were still common that have since receded to only a few rela­ Page 127 tively isolated rural areas. These practices in cluded, for example, charming evening serenades of the young woman by the suitor and his friends. The young woman would be notified in advance of her admirer’s plan, so she could assemble in anticipation with her friends"

Since marriage links for merly in dependent families, the best linkage will be with another family with whom for tunes can be combined to in crease one’s collective standing in the community. Similarly, there is a strong tendency to select suitable marriage partners from one’s own social economic class; stories of the rich boy marrying the chaste and beautiful but poor girl are extremely rare in the Philippine context. There are also strong ethno­linguistic and racial lines beyond which, until recently, few Filipinos were willing to cross, unless for some clear social or economic advantage. For example, marriages between ethnic Chinese men and Filipinas were usually only at tractive to poorer women.

This basic social value, augmented by the clout of the Roman Catholic church, has meant that in troducing modern birth control into the country has been an uphill battle; the Philippines still has one of the highest birth rates in the world. Eventually, the courting couple will decide to marry and become engaged. It is at this point that the traditional family system returns in full force because marriage is the glue that holds the family to gether. The actual engagement period will vary depending on other family obligations, the desire to prepare properly for the wedding, and if the bride is already pregnant. For Filipinos, the only valid marriage ceremony is a religious one since a civil ceremony does not have strong enough connotations. Because marriage and, perhaps more importantly, its stability is essential to the maintenance and strength of the Filipino family, it is believed that there must be the sanction of God behind the vows and that anything less is of little consequence. This commonly accepted belief takes on legal weight in the Philippines where the in fluence of the Roman Catholic church is so great that divorce is not a legal option.

Until a child is born the partners are still only a couple rather than a family. While a son is preferred, gender is not as important in Filipino society as it is in patrilineal societies such as the Chinese. The important thing is that a true family is created because of the birth of an of fspring. Additionally, new social roles Page 131 are created as the married couple become parents and their parents, in turn, become grandparents; everyone gains additional respect and honor in the community. In rural farm families, children continue to be valued as future helpers in the family’s daily economic life. As well, among the urban poor it is expected that children will supplement the family’s meager in come by doing odd jobs. In any case, all families, rich or poor, welcome children with the expectation that they will provide for their parents in old age.

In addition, children are important because they reaffirm God’s blessing on the marital union and further cement the bond between the two partners. When otherwise serious conflicts occur between the married couple, these differences are patched over for the sake of the children. Finally, just as male masculinity is calculated by the number of children he sires, so too is the wife’s womanhood established by giving birth. All of these expectations adversely affect a couple that cannot have their own children and must adopt. Since public in stitutions are relatively less developed in the Philippines than in Western societies, it is the family that provides the principle vehicle for socialization, which the parents usually take very seriously. Since the Filipino male’s or ientation is that of provider whose activities take him outside of the home, the task of child raising falls primarily to the mother, at least in the early stages of growth. Her burden is eased somewhat in the case of a male child, who may later accompany his father outside the home. Because of the mother’s in tense in volvement with her children, male and female alike, she takes on a status in the effective authority of the working of the family that the male cannot equal. Because of the mother’s importance, most Filipino families are matrifocal, that is to say that they are or ganized around the mother and, perhaps, some of her relatives and friends.

More importantly, the debt that the typical Filipino child feels to ward his or her mother goes far beyond the gift of life—to the child, mother is everything. Since the child can never fully repay his or her mother, the relationship between them is always unequal and requires that complete loyalty will always be given to her. The father may earn the child’s respect but being psychically distant, and frequently absent from the household, he is difficult to approach and is somewhat for bidding.

Some critics contend that the freedom of the child to develop in her or his own way is greatly limited and this stifles personality growth and circumscribes in dividual in itiative. As a consequence, the child’s ego is subordinated to the family and not allowed to grow to its fullest potential. The family, then, can become authoritative despite its loving and caring bonds. Extrapolating further, since the family, with the mother at its core, is the focus of every Filipino’s worldview, wider concerns about and feelings of responsibility for the greater Filipino community and nation are neglected. In public life, the Filipino society’s family focus is responsible for much government nepotism and corruption, since public of fice is not an abstract trust but is a gain for the sake of the family and its allies.18 The counterargument states that the warm and loving familial womb protects the in dividual and provides a comfortable base from which the child may launch him or herself into the world"

Since the father is provider and distant authority figure who gains respect for his ability to operate in the wider world beyond the family circle, much of his potential authority is delegated to his wife.

Eventually, the husband may be tempted to seek comfort in extramarital affairs, since divorce is not an option to escape from an unsatisfactory marital relationship.

While the estimates of the number of his “girlfriends” varies slightly, he acknowledged a dozen, some of whom are close enough in his affection that he put them up in large mansions in elite neighborhoods of Manila during his presidency. Estrada’s predecessor, President Fidel V. Ramos was much more modest, and he never commented on an alleged linkage with a prominent society lady who was his active political supporter. Clearly, it is in the realm of extramarital relations that the culture’s double standard is most sharply revealed. How does the wife react to the double standard and her husband’s extramarital activity? In most in stances, the man’s in fidelity only confirms the woman’s role as the long­suffering upholder of virtue that, in turn, strengthens her bond with her children and further decreases the husband’s role in the family. In most cases, the girlfriend and wife never meet, since the husband is usually careful to select a partner outside of his own community. One problem that can arise is when the girlfriend becomes pregnant. Since the child is the husband’s, the legal wife cannot completely disown the child, and in in stances where the birth mother is unwilling or unable to care for the child, it may be brought into the primary home where it is accepted and given love, despite the child’s birth circumstances.

In the home the husband may still be reluctant to shoulder household chores, but he is more available to his children than fathers were in the past and he is more overtly affectionate and is willing to spend time with his young. In metro Manila shopping malls, Page 134 Young Manila professional couple with one child standing in front of their modern ranch­style home in a gated community. Photo by the author. husbands can of ten be seen with and caring for their children in ways that would have seem unmanly only a decade or so ago. To a significant degree, these changes in middle class male social behavior seem to be the result of greater economic and social for ces. For example, with in creased opportunities for women in the workforce, many more professional women have demanding jobs, which give them more compensation than ever and higher degrees of self­confidence but also require in creased commitments of time and energy"

For example, with in creased opportunities for women in the workforce, many more professional women have demanding jobs, which give them more compensation than ever and higher degrees of self­confidence but also require in creased commitments of time and energy. Since many young professional women are making significant contributions to the family in come, there is a need for their husbands to help in the care and nurturing of the children. It is no longer sufficient to leave the children in the care of a household helper. Supporting these economic changes is a growing sensitivity to the in equalities of the traditional family and the double standard. Though not frequent, there are more stories in the national press about spousal abuse and a greater tendency to condemn the errant husband. Symptomatic of these changes in social at titudes and helping to push them along has been the rise of an or ganized feminist movement, Gabriela, since the 1980 s. While few Page 135 women are members of Gabriela, their ideas about the mselves and their role in Philippine society are being studied and reshaped by new women’s studies centers at schools such as St. Scholastica’s College and the University of the Philippines. This movement has the active support of liberal members of the country’s Roman Catholic clergy, which means that women’s issues are now in cluded in any review of the nation’s human rights conditions.20 Traditional at titudes that subordinated women or treated them in a paternalistic manner are becoming in creasingly anachronistic. In fact, President Estrada’s cavalier at titude to ward his numerous affairs and his occasional degrading references about women have backfired with a significant portion of the in for med electorate and may have helped pave the way for the storm of criticism that greeted revelations in October 2000 of his central role in a huge bribery and corruption scandal"

Within the last decade, the availability of contraceptives has in creased, along with the respectability of birth control, both of which have implications for the future of the Filipino family. Though the Philippines still has one of the highest birth rates in the world, more and more young married couples are limiting their family size in response to the high costs of child rearing in the modern economy. Meanwhile, despite the fact that divorce is still not possible, annulments are gaining in popularity, the reby sidestepping violation of the for mal marriage vow. So far only a tiny fraction of the country’s population are in a position to take advantage of this option, but there is in creased recognition that something should be done about dysfunctional marriages. For the near future, however, the tightly knit Filipino family remains strong and provides a warm and loving environment to its members, despite its problems and weakness. That it is undergoing changes is not at all surprising and neither is its strength. The bilateral family has served the Filipino people well and has the capacity to modify itself to the new environment. While more Filipinas will demand a greater degree of equality in the family and in society in general, and while youth will strive for greater freedom in dating and mate selection, the bonds that hold family members to gether will remain strong.

So, no announcer could simply do his airtime every day and leave promptly at the conclusion of his shift until the next workday. It was expected that announcers would stay and “hang out” with the other guys who worked at the station. Even after work, station personnel constantly socialized with each other such that old friends became distant memories. Announcers who tried to buck this social reality usually did not last long. 10.

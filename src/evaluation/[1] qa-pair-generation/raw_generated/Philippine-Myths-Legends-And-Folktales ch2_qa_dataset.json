      "context": "The Two Woodcutters and the Elf ONE AFTERNOON a poor woodcutter entered the for est to chop down at ree for firewood. He chose a tall, straight tree beside a dark lake and started swinging his axe. The ring of the axe echoed and reechoed through the wilder- ness. The woodcutter worked fast, for he hoped to finish cutting down the tree before nightfall. But the blade of his axe became loose, slipped off the handle, and fell into the lake. The man dived into the water to find the blade, but though he dived again and again, he failed to find it. The woodcutter sat at the foot of the tree wondering what he should do, when suddenly an elf appeared before him and asked: “What is troubling you, good man?” “The blade of my axe fell into the water,” he replied. “I wonder how I can get it.” “Let me see what I can do,” said the elf, diving into the lake. Soon she broke the surface holding an axe blade of pure gold. It shone brightly in the sun as the water dripped from it. “Is this your axe blade?” she asked. As I said before, the woodcutter was a poor man. He knew that if he could have the gold blade he would be the richest man in the barrio. But he promptly shook his head OF; at the question and said, “No, that’s not mine.” The elf left the blade on the bank and dived in again. By and by she emerged from the water holding an axe blade of shining silver. “Is this it?” she asked. Again the woodcutter thought how much money he would get for the silver blade. But he shook his head as before and said, “No, that’s not mine.” The elf left the blade beside the first one and dived in again. Soon she. reappeared on the surface, and this time she held the woodcutter’s old iron blade. “Is this it?” she asked. “Yes, that’s my blade!” replied he. “Thank you very much for taking the trouble to find it!” The elf gave the blade to him, but when the man started for home, she picked up the silver blade and the gold blade and said, “I admire you very much for your honesty"

Because of this I should like to give you both the silver blade and the gold blade as a present.” The woodcutter thanked her again, took her gifts, and walked home happily. Now the woodcutter had a neighbor, and when this neighbor saw the axe blades of silver and gold, he asked: “Where did you get them?” 28 “I was cutting a tree beside a lake in the woods,” the other replied, “when the ade of my axe slipped off and fell into the water. I cou! not find it, and an elf came. She not only found the blade for me but she gave me these two as well.” The woodcutter said nothing else, for he was not a man of many words. “Tell me how to get there,” said the other. “I want to go and try my luck, too.” The woodcutter told him how to find the way to the lake. Then the other hurried home; took his old axe, loosened the blade on its handle a little, and ran off into the woods. He looked this way and that, walking deeper and deeper into the for est, until he found the lake. He saw the tree partly cut at the bank of the water and knew this was the place. So he started swinging his axe and his blows echoed and reechoed in the woods. It did not take long before his loose axe blade slipped off and fell into the water. He dived in once, pretending to look for it. Then he sat at the bank of the lake, putting ona very sad face and pretending to cry over his misfor- tune. By and by the elf appeared before him and said, “My good man, what are you so sad about?” “T lost my dearest possession,” replied he, moaning louder than before"

The man did not have to wait long. Soon the elf came out of the water holding up an axe blade of pure silver which shone in the afternoon sun. “Is this the blade?” she asked. 29 The man took the blade from her and said, “Why, yes! That is my own silver blade! Thank you for finding it. Now there is only one more blade for me to find.” “I shall try to find it, too,” said the elf and dived in again. “Now,” thought the man, “I shall be as rich as my neighbor.” After a few moments the elf emerged from the water holding an axe blade of shining gold. She held it before him and asked, “Is this the other blade?” The man held out his hand to reach for it and said, “Yes, yes! This in deed is my second axe blade! What a good diver you are! Thank you for helping me.” But the elf held the blade off from him and said, “You shall have neither of these two blades. I only help those who are honest. Get out of my woods quickly or you will be sorry!” So saying, the elf took the silver blade from him, too, and disappeared. The man felt very much ashamed and walked home"

THE OLD WOMAN finished winnowing rice under the bamboo tree just as the sun set. She piled up the chaff ina mound as high as an anthill and built a slow fire with the chaff. Then she went into her garden and dug up some yams, and she put the yams in the slow fire. “When I wake up to morrow morning,” she told her- self, “the yams will be just right for breakfast.” She went into her hut and cooked supper, and then she ate and went to bed. The cocks had not been crowing long early the next morning before she hurried down her ladder to take the yams out of the fire. “I shall have a delicious breakfast of roasted yams,” she said. But whichever part of the fire she looked, not a single yam did she find. “Ah, the kiba-an have been in my yard!” she said. Now, by kiba-an the old woman meant the unseen wee folk who delight in such petty mischiefs as stealing rice from the housewife’s bin, running off with the fish in the fisherman’s traps, or pulling off hair from children’s heads. The kiba-an’s skin is as light as the skin of the white man, and its mouth shines with its gold teeth. Another queer thing about the kiba-an is that its heels point before and its toes behind, misleading people who follow its footprints. The kiba-an’s long hair reaches 31 down to its feet, and some people say they have of ten seen groups of them singing on vines in the bamboo groves or dancing in the woods to the music of wee, wee guitars"

Sometimes, in the night, the wee folk wander into people’s yards, and so, when throwing things out of their win- dows, people say, “Get out of the way!” For if by mistake people should hurt them, the kiba-an will give them sickness or cause their death. Well, the next day after sundown the old woman built another mound of chaff, kindled it, and put more yams in the fire. Then she cooked supper and ate. But after sup- per, in stead of going to bed, she sat down to listen at the window. In a trice, she heard tiny voices saying: “Aha-ha-hai! The old woman’s yams — how nice they taste!” “Tt is just as I thought!” the old woman told herself. “The kiba-an are eating the yams.” She went to bed, and the next morning she walked to the mound of burning chaff and found that the yams were gone again. “It was the kiba-an, all right,” she said. So when the sun set once more, she built another 5 mound of rice chaff and kindled it. But she did not go into the garden to dig up more yams. Instead she walked to the river and chose a few stones as big as her fists, and then she walked home and put the stones in the fire. She sat listening at her window after supper, and very soon she heard the same wee voices. But this time there was no laughter in those voices. “Na-ai-i-i!” one of the wee folk said. “I thought these were yams!” “I, too, thought these were yams!” said another. “But these are only stones!” added a third. “These are only hard stones!” said the others. Soon the wee voices faded into the night, and all was still. Came another sunset, and the old woman built a new fire under the bamboo"

So to his bedside he called his three sons, Diego, Pedro, and Juan. “You each go and look for your wives,” he said. “I should like to see the three of you married before I die.” “Yes, Father,” they replied and got set to go and seek for their wives. As they were leaving, the king added, “Go your separate ways, knock at the door of the first house you come to, and whoever opens the door, ask her to marry you.” The three princes agreed to do what their father told them. Then they mounted their strong horses and gal- loped away. The road soon for ked. They set a day on which they should all return and agreed to meet at the same spot so that they could go home to gether. Then they went their separate ways. After many weary days of travel, Diego, the eldest of the three, came to a large palace. He knocked at the door and a beautiful princess opened it. She was so slender that Diego could have encircled her waist with his thumb and middle finger. She agreed to marry him and went along with him. Pedro, who was next to Diego in years, likewise came to a great palace and tapped at the door. Out came a lovely princess whose skin was so fine and clear that the water could be seen trickling down her throat when she drank. The princess agreed to become Pedro’s wife and went along with him"

Juan, the youngest, came to a tiny hut and knocked at the door. It opened, and out jumped an ugly frog. “Gak!” 35 the frog croaked at Juan. Its voice was hoarse and its skin slimy, but Juan knelt down and picked it up tenderly. “Dear frog,” he said, “I have come a long way looking for you. Will you marry me?” “Gak!” the frog replied. Juan took that to mean yes, so he put the frog in his hat and headed for home. The three brothers met at the time and place they had agreed on. Proudly Diego and Pedro boasted about the princesses they had found and won. They laughed when, asking Juan whom he had brought home for a wife, he showed them the ugly frog. The king met them and was pleased with the two princesses. But he almost went out of his wits with rage when Juan presented him with the frog. “Throw that creature out of the window!” he told Juan. “A frog for my daughter-in-law? Never!” “But Father,” said Juan, “you told us to return with whoever opened the door of the house we first entered. I knocked at the door of a tiny hut and this frog opened it. So I have brought her home.” “I said I will have no frog for a daughter-in-law!” repeated the king. But Juan in sisted that he loved the frog dearly, and so the king said no more about the matter. The wedding day approached and the king or dered a great feast prepared. Criers hurried to all parts of the kingdom telling the people to join the feast.

A few days before the wedding the king said: “Let the brides weave their own veils.” The two princesses sat down to weave their veils, and the frog sat down to weave hers. Diego’s bride worked very hard, but the threads of the veil she made were not straight and the veil itself was out of shape. Pedro’s bride wove a coarse veil, and it was covered with betel stains. The frog leaped over the skein and made an exquisite veil with flowers so dainty that you could almost smell their sweet garden fragrance. 36 At last came the great wedding day. Diego and Pedro were radiant with smiles as their brides leaned on their arms. For his part, Juan held the slimy green frog in his hand, and the people could hardly keep from laughing at him. The king was furious, but Juan in sisted that he loved the frog and wanted to marry her. Just as the veils were about to be thrown over the couples, the frog whispered, “Juan, please crush me under your foot.” Juan was very much pleased to hear the frog speak human words, but he did not want to do what it told him. “I do not want to kill you,” he replied. “I want to marry you.” “Juan, please do what I told you,” begged the frog. “Crush me under your foot.” And so earnestly did she say it that finally Juan crushed the frog under his foot. Then a wonderful thing happened. Where the frog had been there stood a princess so beautiful that the two other princesses appeared like servants beside her. Of course everyone was delighted to see this happy turn of events. Everybody urged the frog-princess to tell her story and so she explained: “I was a princess loved by my parents and my people. But a witch cast a spell over me. She turned me into a frog and said that only the love of a prince could break the spell. Long I waited for the prince to come along, and at last Juan came"

The sun shone over the valley, and he looked up to behold a rainbow for ming in the sky. He saw one end of the rainbow bend to ward the mountain on which he stood admiring its perfect shape and its bright colors. Then he remembered an old story he once heard about the rainbow. A white-haired old man had said that the rainbow was the bridge which the angels took when- ever they came down to earth. “That is why one foot of the rainbow of ten rests on the side of a mountain,” the man had said, adding: “Now if you run fast and get to the foot of the rainbow quick enough, you will find a fragrant pool there. Hide a 9 yourself and watch quietly, and you will see the angels — the birad-dali — come down to bathe in the pool.” The young datu watched the foot of the rainbow bend lower and lower. Soon it almost to uched the tops of the trees that stood in a line winding down the mountainside. Then the rainbow swung away beyond the trees, and its foot descended further until it rested in a cogon patch well within running distance from where he stood. Quite out of breath with excitement, he sprinted to the foot of the rainbow. Over rocks he ran, past a line of trees, and across the cogon grass. Then he stopped and hid in the tall grass, for there, right at the foot of the rainbow, lay a mountain pool"

The pool reflected the rainbow in all its glorious colors. There was a fragrance in the air, too, and in haling this way and that, he found that the sweet odor came from the pool. “Everything the old man said is true!” he thought, watching from his hiding place in the grass. More wonders followed, for looking up, he saw a beautiful angel come walking lightly down the rainbow. She resembled a princess of storyland coming down a palace stairway. She cast her glance here and there, and the young man could see that she was trying to make sure nobody was around. But as I said before, he sat hidden in the tall grass, so the angel did not see him. Gracefully she alighted from the rainbow, her white feet twinkling above the water for a moment, and then she descended into the pool. “How beautiful she is!” thought he. “I must go and speak to her.”. He came out of hiding, crept through the reeds, and then, when near enough, leapt into the water after her. The angel was frightened, and with a splash she fled to the foot of the rainbow. But he caught her wrists in his hands and held her firmly before she could climb out of the water. 40 “Let me go! Let me go!” cried the angel, struggling to free herself. “No, you must not go,” he replied, and he held her more firmly still. “Please let me go!” wailed the angel. “Let me go!” “If you return to heaven,” said he, “I can never hope to see you again.

Night was falling and the countryside was growing dark.

He was kicking about and crying on a banana leaf spread on the ground. | “Poor baby!” said Mente, picking it up and kissing its cheeks. “It is cold!” 42 “And it must be hungry besides!” said Yoyong. “Where could its mother be?” “I don’t believe it has a mother,” said Mente. “I’ll take it home and raise it. When it grows big and I’ma man it will be my servant. It will cook my meals and serve me at the table and wash the dishes.” “No, you give me that baby,” said Yoyong. “It’s mine. I heard its cry first.” “It’s mine!” replied Mente. “You may have heard it first, but you were for running away. You would have run away, too, if I did not force you to come with me and look for it.” Yoyong claimed the baby but Mente said the baby was his, and they grew angry with each other. Yoyong ran off to a bamboo fence and pulled out a stake to strike Mente with. Mente saw him and, putting down the baby, pre- pared to fight Yoyong. But no sooner had he put the baby on the ground than a strange thing happened. In a twinkling the baby became an old man with an ugly, frightful face. He had a beard that hung down to his chest, and his face was covered with thick hair"

He had a beard that hung down to his chest, and his face was covered with thick hair. His eyes were bright and small, and one of his legs was much longer than the other. He was a tianak. | When Mente saw the tianak, he became so terrified 43 that he turned to run away. But the wake leaped after him and buried his sharp teeth in his arm. Mente screamed for help and when Yoyong heard him and saw the tianak, he became very much frightened, too. So he started running away and exclaiming: “Susmariosep! Susmariosep!” No sooner were the words out of Yoyong’s mouth than the tianak let go of Mente and vanished into the darkness. Then Yoyong and Mente for got their anger and ran away as fast as ever you please. They reached home tired and breathing hard. Aling Nenang, Yoyong’s mother, put some medicine where the tianak had bitten Mente. “It’s lucky that Yoyong said ‘Susmariosep,” Aling Nenang said. “Only that word can drive the tianak away.” “Please tell us more about the tianak,” said Mente. “The tianak looks frightful,” she said. “But he does not harm you unless you harm him first or unless he sees you are afraid. Remember that when you see another tianak.” ad “I hope I will never see a tianak again,” said Yoyong. “Why does the tianak turn himself into a baby, Aling Nenang?” asked Mente. “So that you will go near him,” she replied. “When you are near enough, he changes himself into his ugly form to rrighten you with his fearful looks.

The flowers of the bangar tree have a bad smell, but strange to tell, elves make their home in bangar trees although they are such dainty people. Every year whenever the tree bloomed, the fisherman wanted to cut it down. But he was afraid that the elves living in the tree would harm him, and so he and his son patiently endured the bad smell. One year, however, he grew so sick with the smell that he decided to cut down the tree. He sharpened his axe and proceeded to the foot of the tree. “I do not care what will happen to me for this,” he told himself. “I must chop down this tree.” But when he swung his axe, a kiba-an, a pretty elf as small as a child of two years, came down from the tree"

He took the hat, thanked the elf, and left. On his way home on. 47 he wore the hat and found that no one, not even the dogs and wild birds, could see him. “I shall not tell my son about this hat till he is a grown- up man,” thought he, hiding it. “He might do unwise things with it if he gets it before he is old enough.” The next year when the bangar tree bloomed again, the fisherman grew so sick with the smell that he set out to cut down the tree. “Perhaps the kiba-an has moved into another tree,” he said. But just as before, when he swung his axe, the elf came down. She was sitting on a chair suspended in the air, and, “Good man,” said she, “spare my tree and I will give you this chair.” “Of what good is it?” he asked. “You only have to sit on it and it will take you wher- ever you wish.” The man took the chair, sat on it, thanked the elf, and or dered the chair to take him home; and sure enough, the next moment he found himself right at home.

He called for the boy and asked him to bring the hat, the chair, and the purse to his bedside. He told him about what they each could do and added: “You are a man now, Son, and I am going to leave you these three things. May you be happy!” 48 He was dead before the bangar tree bloomed again. Now in the city lived the king, his queen, and their beautiful young daughter, and the fisherman’s son wanted to marry the princess. He was very prosperous now because he had the magic purse. He bought an expensive carriage and six steeds and or dered costly suits for himself. Then he dressed up, put the magic purse in his pocket, and drove his carriage about the king’s palace. The king saw the young man, sent for him, and said, “Young Prince, from what kingdom do you come, and what would you like to have in our city?” “IT would prefer to tell this to your daughter the princess, King,” replied the fisherman’s son. “May I speak with her?” The king thought that the young man was over- bold.

For three days they remained on the hill quarreling. On the fourth morning, while he was asleep, she took the chair quietly and said, “Carry me back into my chamber!” and the chair did so. Then the youth awoke and found himself alone. “This is bad!” he said. “I don’t even know which is east and which is west!” He rose and walked to ward the nearest hill. He walked and walked but found neither food nor water. He was about to die of hunger and thirst when he came to a clear stream, and there on its bank stood a tree full of red fruit. Greedily he ate the fruit until his hunger was ap- peased. But when he bent over the water to drink, he saw two horns standing proudly on his head. Naturally he was very much alarmed. He pulled and pulled but the horns, no matter how much he pulled them, would not come off. He fell asleep pulling them and he dreamed pulling them, but they stood as firm as ever. At last he was exhausted and his hands were wet, and the horns slipped whenever he tried to pull them off. So he picked up some of the leaves of the tree, wrapped them for holds about his horns, and pulled—and lo! the horns came off pleasantly, like tight shoes being taken off after a long walk ona sunny road. “So this is the secret of these horns!” he said"

Since food is one of the liveliestareas of popu- larculture, ithas of course been friendlyto for eign in fluences, and to change. Chinese traders, the Spanish, colonizers and proselytizersboth, and in the 20 th century, the United States—all lefttheir mark on the localfood. The signature in gredients of the Southeast Asian neighbors are present too, in the form of chilies, lemongrass and fragrant/pun- gent fishsauce, calledpatis. Recent times have seen foods from other more distantlands sometimes oc- cuping a small corner of the Filipinotable. To the question the refore, What is Filipinofood? One can answer, allof the above.

Indigenousdishesblendedwithflavorsbroughtby Chinesetraders and the spicesoftheconquistadorescomprisethisversatilecuisine By Doreen Fernandez he Philippines country culture starts in a tropicalclime divided into rainy and dry sea- sons and an archipelago with 7,000 islands. These islescontain the Cordilleramountains, Luzon's cen- tralplains, Palawan's coralreefs; seas to uching the world'slongest discontinuous coastline; and a mul- titude of lakes, rivers, springs and brooks. The population—120 dif: ferent ethnic groups and the mainstream communi- ties of Tagalog/Ilocano/ Pampango/ Pangasinan and Visayan lowlanders— worked within a gentlebut lush environment. In it they shaped the irown life- ways: building houses, weaving cloth, tellingand writing stories; orna- ment ing and decorating, preparing food. Foreign in fluences made deep impact on native island culture. The Chinese traders, who had been coming to the islands since the 11 th century, brought silks and ceramics, took away products from the for estand sea, and leftbehind them many traditionsso deeply embedded in daily lifethat Fil- ipinos do not realizetheirprovenance. Filipinosof Chinese ancestry comprise an important facetofthe national profile. In the 16 th century, the Spanish colonizersim- ported Christianity, and the culturerelatedto a col- on izationthatlastedthree centuries. Families were “proughtwithin the sound of church bells”; and thus were created villages, to wns and cities. Spanish culturalforms replaced or melded with in digenous ex- pressions. The folkcultures of the Christianized low- lands are thus greatly His- panicized, as against the Cordillerahighlands (later reached by Protestantmis- sionaries) and Mindanao (where the Muslims long resisted Spanish colonization). Afterthe Revolution of 1889, the Battleof Manila Bay, and the pact of exchange between the US and Spain, the country became an American colony. The US-stylegovernment and educational system imported along with the popular culturemade Fil- ipinos the most “Americanized Asians”, and the Philippines one of the larger English-speaking countries of the world.

All, of course, came to be in digenized—Filip- in izedby the in gredientsand by localtastes. Today, for example, Pansit Malabon has oystersand squid, since Malabon isa fishingcenter; and Pansit Mari- lao issprinkled with ricecrisps, because the town iswithin the Luzon ricebowl. When restaurantswere es- tablishedin the 19 th century, Chinese foodbecame a stapleof the pansiterias, with the food given Spanish names for the ease of the clientele: thus co- mida China (Chinese food) in- cludes arroz caldo (rice and chicken gruel); and morisqueta to stada(friedrice). When the Spaniards came, the food in fluences they brought were from both Spain and Mexico, as itwas through the vice-royaltyof Mexico that the Philippineswere governed. Thismeantthe Proicionoffoodforanelite, non- food-producing class, and a food for which many in- gredientswere not locallyavailable. Fil-Hispanicfood had new flavorsand in gredi- ents—oliveoil, paprika, saffron, ham, cheese, cured sausages—and new names. Paella, the dish cooked in the fieldsby Spanish workers, came to be a fes- tivedish combining pork, chicken, seafood, ham, sausages and vegetables, a luxuriousmix of the local and the for eign. Relleno, the process of stuffingfes- tivecapons and turkeys for Christmas, was applied to chickens, and even to bangus, the silverymilk- fish. Christmas, a new feastfor Filipinosthat coin- cided with the riceharvest, came to featurenot only the myriad native ricecakes, but also ensaymadas (brioche-likecakes but tered, sugared and cheese- sprinkled)to dip in hot thickchocolate, and the ap- ples, or anges, chestnuts and walnuts of European 8 PART ONE: FOOD IN THE PHILIPPINES Christmases. Even the Mexican corn tamal turned Filipino, be- coming rice-based tamales wrapped in banana leaves. The Americans in troduced to Philippinecuisinethe ways of convenience: pressure-cook- ing, freezing, pre-cooking; sand- wiches and salads; hamburgers, friedchicken and steaks. Add to the above other cuisines found in the country along with other global in flu- ences: French, Italian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Thai, Viet- namese. They grow familiar, but remain “imported” and not yet in digenized. On a buffet tabletoday one might find, for ex- ample, kinilawna tanguingue, mackerel dressedwith vinegar, ginger, on ions, hot peppers, perhaps co- conut milk; alsogrilledtigershrimp, and maybe sini- gang na baboy, pork and vegetablesin a broth soured with tamarind, all from the native repertoire. Alongside there would almost certainlybe pansit, noodles once Chinese, now Filipino, stillin a sweet-sour sauce. Spanish festivefarelikemorcon (beefrolls), embutido (pork rolls), fishescabecheand stuffedchicken or turkey might be there too. The centerpiece would probably be lechon, spit-roasted pig, which may be Chinese or Polynesian in in flu- ence, but bears a Spanish name, and may the refore derive from cochinilloasado. Vegetable dishescould in clude an American saladand a pinakbet (vegeta- bles and shrimp paste). The dessert table would surelybe richly Spanish: lecheflan(caramelcustard), natilla, yemas, dulcesde naranja, membrillo, to rtadel rey, etc., but alsoinclude localfruitsin syrup (co- conut, santol, guavas) and American cakes and pies.

The varia- tions are traceable to the character of, first, the nat- ural resources—the pro- duce of differentsoilsand seas, plants and animals, and to the regionalcharac- ter of differentisland peoples—separate, in sular, fractionalized(and proud of the irdifferences). The basic foodstuffsand condiments become more in- terestingwhen explored among in sularplaces. The northwest coastof Luzon isthe Ilocosregion, a stripof land between the mountains and the sea, where fiveprovinces share the same language, food and to ugh challenges of nature. Ilocanos are frugal and hardy, relyingon what can be coaxed from the ment ed fishor shrimp. Ilocanos’ meat dishes lean to ward high choles- terol: lomo, a pork liverand kidneys soup; longganisa, a fattyground-pork sausage enjoyed for breakfast; and bagnet, dried pork belly, deep friedwith bagooneg. Two cuisinesin the rice- and-sugar lands of Central Luzon—Pampanga and Bulacan—claim superiority over the other. In Pampanga food is a major pre- occupation; the cuisine is or nate and lavish, like their wood carving. Many exotic dishes are at trib- uted to land-locked Pampanga: fried catfish with buro, a fermented ricesauce; fermented crabs; frogs or milkfish in a sour soup; friedmole crickets, and cured pork slicescalled to sino. As a sugar-producingprovince, Pampanga sweet- 10 PART ONE: FOOD IN THE PHILIPPINES ens many of her dishes—especially desserts! There are Spanish-in fluenced cream puffs, egg yolk cus- tards, turrones, marzipans and meringues; plus the very native tibok-tibok(water buffalo milk blended with corn). From here comes bringhe (a fiestarice made with coconut milk); ensaymada, a but terybun; lecheflan, acreme briiléemade with water buffalo milk; and a great array of stickyricecakes. In Bulacan, the motto isnot to eat anything un- less itmakes you swoon with pleasure. Bulacan cooking isunhurried, old-fashioned, sure, and very varied, based on wide in gredient resources. River fish are boiled with citrusor in palm wine, then flamed. Eels are simmered in coconut cream; salt- water fish, in vinegar and ginger.

Several dishes comprise the “national”cuisine: bistek(beef and on ion ringsbraised in soy sauce); lumpia (spring rolls); and the popular adobo— chicken and pork stewed in vinegar and soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf. Every province boasts of having the best version of adobo. Manila’s is soupy with soy sauce and garlic. Cavite cooks mash pork liver into the sauce. Batangas adds the or ange hue of annatto; Laguna likeshers yellowish and piquant with turmeric. Zamboanga's adobo is thick with coconut cream. Three other items represent mainstream tastes and might be called“national”dishes.

An array of sour- ing agents—unripe guavas; tamarind leaves and flowers; kamias; to matoes—help make a home- cooked sinigangof seafood or meat and vegetables as varied as the 7,000 islands. There isthe stew known as dinuguan—basically pig blood and in nards simmered with vinegar and hot peppers. Most regions do the dinuguan stew in their own versions. Finally there's lechon, the whole roast pig or piglet, starofmany fiestaoccasions. Lechon isslowly roasted over livecoals, basted regularly—and made crisp and lus- cious. The tastysauce is concocted from the pig's liver, simmered with vinegar, sugar and herbs. From the surrounds of Laguna de Bay, the heart-shaped lake of the Southern Tagalog provinces, a rustic and honest cuisine has evolved. The lake and the mountains are the sources for: carp cooked in a sour soup; tilapia stuffed with tamarind leaves; and lake shrimp sim- mered in thick coconut cream. Farther south, Batangas waters provide many fish for the table: Ocean tuna is layered and slowly cooked in an earthenware pot; freshwater sar- dines come from Taal Lake; and fermented fishba- goong comes from Balayan town. Batangas province isrenowned, too, for itsbeef in dustry, itsbulalo(ox- tailsoup in cludingthe bone marrow) and her strong barako coffee (robusta). In Quezon the preferred meat iscarabao (water buffalo), stewed in a spicy to mato sauce. And the preferred noodle dish is pancit habhab—noodles scooped in toa banana leaf pocket and eaten likean ice cream cone. The Bicol Region—six provinces along the south- eastern peninsula of Luzon—is a lush land famous for the majestic Mayon Volcano; the smallest fish in the world; coconut for ests; pilinuts—and spicy- hot coconut-creamy food! It has been oft said that the Bicolano farmer, in the face of frequent typhoons plaguing the region, ties down his in dis- pensable sili(chilipep- per) plantsbefore look- ing afterhis wife. Bicol is synony- mous with gata or co- conut cream. Siliand gata come to gether de- liciously, especially in the famous Bicol dish called pinangat. Littlebundles of gabi (taro)leaves are filled with shredded taro leaves and bits of tasty meat; the bundles are simmered in gata, and laced with a fist- ful of chilies.

In Mindanao, the frontierland of the far south, everyday cuisineismore Malay in in fluence and dis- tinctly exotic in taste. Spices are used liberally: turmeric, ginger, garlic, chiliesand roasted coconut. Seafoods are eaten raw, broiled or fried; or put in soups with lemongrass, ginger and green papayas; or coconut cream and turmeric. Chicken isserved in curry; or combined with taro in a stinging soup. Root crops are served, alongside the staple rice. Cassava isboiled and grated into cakes; riceappears as puso, “hearts”, cooked in woven coconut fronds. Glutinous rice isoften mixed with shrimp, spices, or coconut milk; or cooked with turmeric and pi- mento. The most exotic fruitsof the country are found in Mindanao: durian, marang, man- gosteen, and lanzones. Zamboanga is a Catholic town with a distinct Spanish accent on her cuisine. Cocido, the traditional Sunday platter, isprepared like its Iberian prototype, with sausage, salted pork, pork ribs, sweet potatoes, corn and cooking bananas. Zam- boanga has several very unique dishes— tatos, big ugly crabs that taste of the co- conut meat they liketo feed on; and curacha, the weirdest crab with the sweetest flavor.

Soon church bells ring, callingthem to Mass to celebrate the feast of the patron saint—the Blessed Virgin in her many at tributes, or saints of the religious or ders that worked at the Christian- ization of the country. After the church rites, each town celebrateswith elements of in digenous and Hispanicized custom: reli- gious processions in which the statue of the saint is borne through town; folk the ater like komedya and sarswela, allfreetothe pub- lic; games (e. g. water buf- falo races) and fireworks; and certainlyfood and feasting. In the old times, allhomes were open to allcom- ers. The town of Lucban, Quezon, dedicated to San Isidro Labrador (St. Isidorethe worker), proudly cel- ebrates with food in a unique way. The houses lin- ing the designated procession route are decorated with the varied fresh produce of the area. Rice stalks, bananas in bunches, vegetables, white gourds, squashes, green and ripe mangoes, co- conuts, fish-shaped bread, succulent whole roast pigs, and especiallythe brightlymulti-coloredrice wafers calledkiping, decorate, even cover, the fa- cades of houses. The owners compete not only for the cash prize of feredby the town, but for the at- tentionoftheirneighbors, in the promise of another year, the good for tune of another harvest, and the joy of being to gether as Lucbanin.

At the end guests and allworkers were given packets of food to take home to the unfortunates who could not come to the fiesta. At the September feastof our Lady of Penafran- ciain Naga City, guestsfrom othertowns would start coming a week before, in carriagesand carabao- drawn carts bearing not only guestsbut ser- vants, bedding and pro- visions. They would stay with relatives(no hotels then), but set up temporary house- holds.

Part Two: The Filipino Kitchen New efficientmodelsmayhavereplacedtheold, but traditionalimplementsstillretaina much-valuedrusticcharm. he traditional Filipinokitchen is a concept fast-fadingin the city; the old-fashioned cooking room exists in tact to day only in rare provincialsettingsor re-createdhouse-museums. The in digenous implements of stone, clay, wood or coconut shell, once used widely in kitchens, are now in the hands of antique collectorswho have preserved the oljetsfor the irpleasing forms. But the implements’ functionshave been taken over by mass-produced to olsand mod- ern appliances of the 20 th century. From thatprovincialkitchen—where Filipino cooks created their delec- table native dishes—several tradi- tion altoolsand methods are worth sa- voring here.; The typical Philippine kitchen was usuallyhidden from the publicview, as it was a small, smoky, and basic affair. The rural kitchen was comprised of several simple clay stoves propped on an ashy shelf, clay pots of dif- ferentsizes, cast-ironpots and pans, sundry wood and bamboo implements, and food-processing to olsfashioned from heavy stone. Kalans are bulbous clay stoves, shaped to bear a wood-fire in their bellies while they hold the pots and pans over the flames. Small sticks of wood peek through the front opening, while the cook- ing fire is kept going by well-placed blowing through a bamboo straw (calledan thip). Itis a labor-in tensiveprocess: The flames are controlled by the constant removal and replacement of the glowing coals, perpetually adjustingthe heat, de- pending on what the dish requires. Gas burners and electricstoves have, of course, replaced the wood-fires and kalans of old, but the new technology cannot duplicate the unique flavors that emerge from the gentle, hand-tended method. Palayoks are the red earthenware potsused for boilingsoups and steam- ing rice.(Traditionally, white riceis cooked with banana leaves liningthe palayok’sbottom and a fragrantpandan leaftucked among itsgrainsjust before it’sdone.) Kawalis are the versatilewoks made of cast-iron with curved-bottoms; the parabolic pans are used for justabout every- thing else: stir-frying, deep-frying, braising, sautéingor making sauces. The kawalis are also used for steaming; foodstuffsare wrapped in | buri or banana leaves and propped —~ THE FILIPINO KITCHEN 23 Opposite: The tradi- tion alkusina or kitchen.

Sometimes the kudku- ran isfondly calledthe kabayo (horse). Local implements for making native cakes and sweets tracetheirnames to Spanish or igins. There are pastry pots and molds of varying sizes, in clud- ing the lanera, a cooking mold for the egg yolk cus- tard calledlecheflan; the chocolatera or batidor, a brass pot for whipping and cooking chocolate; and the tacho, a two-handled copper pan for cooking jel- liesand pastillascandies. The garapinera isa hand- cranked machine for making ice cream. With time and the modern American kitchen as model, Filipinohouseholds have adopted the con- veniences of high technology, while retaining many of the irtraditional(and messy) methods of food preparation. Thus, there are generally two kitchens in the typicalurban Filipinohome. The so- called“dirtykitchen” (perhaps a holdover from the outdoor prep-area of the provincialfiesta)iswhere the kitchen helpers do the basic prepping: cleaning the seafood, dressing the chickens, pounding the shrimp, chopping the vegetables, barbecueing the meat. The “clean”kitchen iswhere the cook uses his or her modern appliances — blenders, mixers, microwave, rice cookers and teflonpans—before serv- ing up delectable dishes to family and friends. The Filipino kitchen has come a long way from rusticdays. 24 PART TWO: COOKING IN THE PHILIPPINES Cooking Methods Thesimplicityof Filipinocookingmethodslets the in gredientstakeastarringrole. he four cooking methods that are the foun- dationof Filipinocookery areboiling(nilaga), grilling(thaw), roasting and steaming (halabos); cooking methods that comply with the modern- day demand for healthy food and cooking.

The choice of souring agent—or pampasim—is vast: lime, ripe guavas, starfruit, tamarind or even young tartpineapple. The most famous of the many nilagaisbulalo, which consistsofboiled legbone containing mar- row with cartilageattached, plus meat and lettuce. Bulalo’sflavor depends on the texture and con- sistency of the beef, the size and quality of the bone, and the duration of boiling time in liquid that islittleelsebut water, saltand pepper. The ubiquitous adobo, both a specificdish and a method of cooking in which pork, chicken, fish, seafood or vegetablesare cooked in vinegar with garlicand pepper, depends on braisingand sim- mering for flavorand tenderness. In the days be- fore refrigerationbecame commonplace, the adobo served as a deliciousway of preservingfood. Kinilaw isanother preserving process that has produced an appetizing dish that is the Filipino version of the Spanish seviche. Raw fish or shrimp are marinated or “cooked” in vinegar, salt and pepper. Visayans favor using fresh fishwhile the Ilocanosand Pampangos opt for kilawingkamb- ing—goat steeped in vinegar and spices. The wondrous lechon or roastpig, epitome of the Filipinoroastingprocess, could have been bor- rowed from the Spanish delicacycochinilloasado— roastsucklingpig. Or, maybe itwas learned from our Polynesian neighbors who roastwhole pigson hot stones. Steaming isanother important cooking method. Most steaming isdone in a wok and many dishes to be steamed are wrapped firstin banana leaves which impart a subtle flavor to the food and preserve itsmoisture. The leafis wiped clean and then softened in hot water before being wrapped around the food. Finally, there is ginataan, the generic term for any dish cooked with coconut milk, of which there are many in the Philippines.

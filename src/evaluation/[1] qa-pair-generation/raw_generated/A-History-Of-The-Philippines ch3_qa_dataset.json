      "context": "3. FROM INDIO TO FILIPINO: EMERGENCE OF A NATION, 1863-1898 “[Padre Damaso] got up and in Tagalog said very ominously, ‘When you come to see me it should not be in borrowed clothes, which is not for you.’ … He went into his quarters and slammed the door, even though I wanted to stop him. What could I do? I barely have my salary. To get it I have to remain in the priest’s good of fices and make a trip to the head of the province, what could I do against him, the town’s main moral, political, and civil authority, supported by his or der, feared by the government, rich, powerful, consulted, listened to, believed, heeded everywhere by everyone? If he in sults me I have to hold my to ngue. If I answer back, he’ll throw me out and my career will be over. How will that help education? On the contrary everyone will side with the priest, they’ll in sult me, they’ll call me vain, proud, preening, a bad Christian, vulgar, and even anti- Spanish and a subversive. They don’t expect knowledge or enthusiasm from a schoolmaster. They just want resignation, humility, in ertia.” —José Rizal, Noli Me Tangere (trans. H. Augenbraum) M ORE THAN ANY OTHER F ILIPINO SUBJECT TO S PANISH COLONIAL rule, the medical doctor, brilliant polymath, and writer José Rizal, in his in cendiary 1887 novel Noli Me Tangere, exposed the state of the archipelago as it was during the waning decades of Spanish hegemony. The voice of the town schoolteacher lamenting his predicament to the protagonist Crisostomo Ibarra echoed eerily the voice of the politicized Indios who, though acutely aware of the need for changes in their society, felt powerless to work for these, blocked by the reactionary character of the dominant figure of the time, the friar; the narrow strictures of education; and a civil administration in different at best and mindlessly cruel at worst. (The sequel to the Noli, El Filbusterismo, or The Subversive, followed in 1891. Even darker in its appraisal of the colonial regime, the Fili, as it was commonly referred to, confirmed Rizal’s pariah status in the eyes of the Spanish overseers.) In the book, the rich Ibarra, recently returned from studies and travels in Europe, personified the ilustrados, “enlightened ones,” who like Rizal and his peers were scions of the rising haute bourgeoisie and the refore had the means to go abroad to seek either further education, political exile, or simply a better life. For the most part, the ilustrados chose Madrid or Barcelona, with some opting to live in Paris. The Europe of fin de siècle nineteenth century had long been steeped in the ideas of the Enlightenment, the zeitgeist heady with the promise of liberty and equality, with its emphasis on in dividual rights, the centrality of reason, and the repudiation of oligarchy, whether in the realm of civil government or religious authority. Perhaps the most violent (and contradictory) manifestation of the Enlightenment’s impact on the Ancien Régime was the French Revolution of 1789. European capitals provided the hothouse in tellectual at mosphere that young, in tellectually curious Filipinos lacked in Manila. The opening up of the colony to in ternational trade at the start of the nineteenth century resulted in a burgeoning middle class, which in turn meant the sons of these upwardly mobile families could be sent to colleges and universities both in Manila and Europe—an in dispensable factor in the development of a national and nationalist consciousness. Principally through the actions and writings of the ilustrados, the currents of reform reached Las Islas Filipinas, so that the islands were in evitably affected by radical political and social changes in Europe. Change may have boarded a slow boat to Manila, but it was coming. Spanish society had already undergone fundamental changes by the time the ilustrados arrived in Europe. The Southeast Asian colony was on the margins of the Spanish empire, distant enough so that these changes did not resonate in stantly or as powerfully as might have been otherwise expected. Nevertheless, political and social alterations in Spain were bound to have an effect on the far- away archipelago. The combination of the Enlightenment with the upheavals brought about by the French Revolution contributed to the spread of liberal ideas in Spain. Specifically, the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 to 1815, continent-wide conflicts that pitted the armies of Napoleon against a varying cast of opponents, further accelerated change and the decline of the old or der. The French in vasion and occupation of Spain led to the Spanish War of Independence (1808-1814). Spanish resistance to the Napoleonic in vasion, assisted by the British surreptitiously, brought about the temporary ascendancy of the Spanish liberals who produced the Cádiz Constitution of 1812, which extended democratic rights not only to Spaniards but also to all non-Spanish subjects of Madrid. Additionally, reflecting the prevalent liberal spirit, the Cádiz Constitution set limits on the monarchy. The Cortes, or Spanish Parliament, was revived and now allowed for a representative from each colony, in cluding the Philippines. The first representative for the archipelago was Ventura de los Reyes, who served from 1810 to 1813. The unheralded de los Reyes was one of the signatories of the Cádiz Constitution, promulgated in March of 1812, but proclaimed in Manila only a year after, in 1813. The constitution affirmed human and political rights. De los Reyes was also in strumental in curtailing the galleon trade, much to the relief of Spanish merchants who had always resented the galleon trade for cutting into their own import businesses. The dissolution of the Manila- Acapulco run freed up trade with other countries and liberalized the conditions under which entrepreneurs operated. Strictly speaking, however, Philippine representation in the Cortes was misleading, as the representatives were of Spanish descent, and in digenous Filipinos had no say in determining who was to “represent” them. The upheavals in Spain had more immediate repercussions in her Latin American colonies, where she was heavily in vested. With the Napoleonic Wars weakening an already vulnerable Spanish empire, the Creoles in the New World colonies set to the task of freeing the mselves from colonial rule. Realizing their economic in terests conflicted with those of Spain, the Creoles led national liberation movements, which resulted in the dissolution of most of the Spanish empire by 1820. In 1814, however, the monarchy was restored, with Ferdinand VII reigning, and the liberal provisions of the Cortes revoked. In 1815 there were violent reactions in the archipelago to this revocation"

News of the Cádiz constitution had reached the islands only in 1813, so its revocation after a little more than a year was viewed with suspicion by the in digenous population, who felt that the principalia arbitrarily and capriciously determined how the laws were to be in terpreted and enforced. By 1820, there was yet another swing to wards Republicanism: the constitutional period was brought back, and Ferdinand exiled. At the same time, direct mail service was established between Spain and the Philippines. The Cortes, revived yet again, approved certain measures specific to the Philippines. Trade was further liberalized, so that products and goods manufactured in the islands were now considered “national,” and thus entitled to the privileges and immunities the law bestowed on Spanish goods. These steps were undertaken essentially to stimulate native entrepreneurship. With the declaration of Mexico’s in dependence from Spain in 1821, Manila ceased to be administratively ruled from Mexico. It now had to be governed directly from far-away Spain, though the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was to shorten the distance considerably, bringing travel time down to five weeks, from the previous three to four months. Another swing to the right in Madrid occurred in 1823, when Ferdinand was restored to absolute power by the French, wielding it until his death in 1833. Predictably, the king revoked the constitution, abolished the Cortes, and in validated its legislative work. By the time of Ferdinand’s restoration, only Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas remained Spanish colonies. Subsequent to Ferdinand’s death, the question of succession proved destabilizing, leading to the Carlist Wars. Essentially a long-running civil war between those who moved to uphold monarchism and tradition and those who favored the continuation of Enlightenment legacies of secularism and a republican form of government, the wars spanned more than four decades, from 1833 to 1876 (though the Civil War that erupted in 1936, between Republican for ces and General Franco and the Falangists can be seen as the endpoint of this conflict). Once more, the Cortes was revived, but this time with limited powers. Queen Cristina, Regent of Spain, or dered it to craft a new constitution. The result: the Constitution of 1837, which established a parliamentary form of government. However, in a blow to the rights of colonies, their right to representation was abolished. Its restoration was one of the goals which the ilustrados would demand. E DUCATION AND THE S PREAD OF I DEAS As the expatriate Indio community in Spain began to grow, there were at tempts to improve the education system archipelago-wide, following an 1839 royal decree. Indeed, a marine school was established in Manila in 1840, its aim to graduate trained pilots for ships sailing to mainland Asia, Europe, or North America. However, while there were primary schools in to wns and villages, these were handicapped by in adequate facilities and the lack of trained teachers. Moreover, local schools were under the control of the local friar, as they had been since the start of the colonial period. More than anything else, the friar was keen to see his young charges learn their catechism by heart, and not in encouraging their faculties of in dependent thinking. For most of Spanish colonial rule, very little legislation existed that dealt with schooling; it was left to the religious or ders to in troduce a systematic method of primary education. At the outset of colonial rule in the late sixteenth century, the Augustinians—the first religious or der in the colony—in structed its parishes to set up schools throughout the archipelago. In 1634 and 1636, archbishops and bishops were asked by Philip IV to educate the in digenous people. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the Crown decreed that primary in struction should be free, and in 1792, Charles III suggested that schools should be supervised by civil authorities, an implicit recognition that education was mainly if not to tally handled by the religious. Government legislation never established a detailed, consistent plan on educational methods for primary schools, even though royal or ders placed emphasis on education, particularly with regard to the construction of buildings, the recruitment of divinity teachers, and the teaching of Spanish. However, with the Educational Decree of 1863, the home government required the establishment of schools and the availability of free primary in struction for children between the ages of seven and twelve. This in evitably improved the system that heretofore privileged only the peninsulares and the native wealthy. One of the goals was for the young to learn Castilian. At any one time, only a small percentage of the subject population—estimated at between 5 to 10 percent—was fluent in Spanish, and this decree was meant to in crease that percentage. But the goal that superseded everything else was still the imparting of Christian doctrine, morality, and what was termed “sacred history”—basically a study of the Bible—to be directed by the parish priest. (Not surprisingly, the first book printed in the colony, in 1593, was the Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Española y Tagalog, or the Christian Catechism in Spanish and Tagalog.) The 1863 decree meant the government taking charge of higher education; of ficial recognition of educational in stitutions established by the religious or ders; a determination of teacher qualifications; and a pay scale"

The 1863 decree meant the government taking charge of higher education; of ficial recognition of educational in stitutions established by the religious or ders; a determination of teacher qualifications; and a pay scale. In turn, the religious or ders gave up some higher-education tasks and focused on free primary, compulsory education for all children of both sexes. After the Maura decree of 1893, schools became free from in spection by the parish priests and the reafter became the responsibility of the local governments. By 1898, the last year of Spanish rule, one reliable estimate put the number of state schools at 2,143, excluding private and religious schools. The educational system in the colony may have developed in fits and starts, but by the time of the American takeover, there was enough of an in frastructure in place for American educators to implement an island-wide public-school system. Having been at it for nearly three centuries, the religious or ders had shaped the landscape of higher education in the country by founding colleges and universities. Among these is the oldest educational in stitution in the country, the University of San Carlos, established by the Spanish Jesuits in Cebu in 1595 but now run by the Society of the Divine Word or der. All other noteworthy schools were founded in Manila: Colegio de San José (1603), founded by the Jesuits; University of Santo Tomás (1611) and the College of San Juan de Letrán (1620), both established by the Dominicans; and La Concordia College, founded exclusively for women by the Daughters of Charity in 1868. Outside of these universities, seminaries run by the religious of fered secondary education to lay students. The 1863 decree also established a normal school for teachers in Manila, to be under the direction of the Jesuits, who having been expelled in 1768, had been allowed to return to the colony in 1859. (That same year, the Jesuits took over the Escuela Municipal de Manila, which in 1865 was raised to the status of a college, the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, now the private Ateneo de Manila university, the third-oldest university in the country.) The normal school was to serve as an educational center for God-fearing and obedient potential teachers. Again, at the top of the list of in tended goals was the imparting of religion, morals, and sacred history. The unremitting emphasis on religious tutelage allowed Catholicism to be deeply entrenched, of ten at the expense of the secular pursuit of knowledge. As educational reforms began to take effect, however sporadically, the number of journals and newspapers in creased. There were seventy-four during the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Among the better known were La Opiníon, Manila Alegre, El Comercio, El Correo, El Católico Filipino, and Diario de Manila. A majority of the publications were in Spanish, and some were bilingual—an in dication not only of the spread of literacy but of news, however modified by the powers that be, outside of Manila. All had to contend with a board of censors that had been set up in 1856, made up of four appointees by the governor and four appointees by the archbishop of Manila, for ever on the lookout for articles that might impugn either the state or the church—or both. As imperfect as it was, the educational system heading into the latter half of the nineteenth century, along with economic and social changes brought about by the opening up of the colony to in ternational trade, did turn out an in telligentsia, among them the ilustrados, the sons of upwardly mobile mestizo and in dio families who had grown critical of colonial rule, and were at the for efront of the reformist movement that came to be known as the Propaganda Movement. But laying the ground for the political awakening of their generation were upheavals in the country’s religious ranks. S ECULARIZATION AND THE C ATACLYSM OF 1872 Presaging the concerted demands for Filipinization of parishes, as well as the revolutionary brotherhood, the Katipunan, which would spring up in 1892, a devout Indio peasant by the name of Apolinario de la Cruz, having had his application to join a friar or der in Manila rejected in 1839, returned to the southern Tagalog provinces and for med the Cofradía de San José, or Confraternity of St. Joseph. De la Cruz (known in the Confraternity as Hermano, or Brother, Pule) was clearly a charismatic leader, for the lay religious brotherhood soon at tracted numerous adherents, whose contributions enabled the Cofradía to sponsor regular masses for its followers, and even fiestas. The authorities, both civil and religious, viewed the confraternity with skepticism and deep suspicion. The church hierarchy refused to recognize its activities as legitimate, and its members were routinely harassed. Institutional disdain and contempt led de la Cruz and the Cofradía to assert the mselves as an in dependent group, claiming to have divine support and refusing anyone but full-blooded natives membership. Mestizos could be accepted but only with de la Cruz’s express consent. At times his followers would proclaim de la Cruz as “King of the Tagalogs”—a clear reference to Christ being heralded as the King of the Jews. Inevitably the state, acting on requests by the friars, acted to suppress what was seen as a potentially explosive in surgent movement by sending troops to the Cofradía’s stronghold in Tayabas, now Quezon, Province. Though in itially successful in repulsing the at tacks, Pule and his confraternity were defeated. At the age of twenty-seven, the would-be priest and his aide, called Purgatorio, were executed along with 200 other members of the Cofradía. De la Cruz’s body was dismembered, his severed head stuck on a pole placed by the roadside in a manner reminiscent of the deaths of Christian martyrs at the hands of the Romans"

De la Cruz’s body was dismembered, his severed head stuck on a pole placed by the roadside in a manner reminiscent of the deaths of Christian martyrs at the hands of the Romans. The Cofradía’s clamor for change in the way religious groups were constituted was clearly emblematic of the groundswell of dissatisfaction with colonial rule and of the push for equal rights. Hence, the Filipinization of the clergy was not simply a religious issue but one in which broader social and economic issues came into play. Being that the Catholic Church and its priests (particularly the Spanish friars) represented the apex of Philippine colonial society, priesthood was viewed by many of the more ambitious natives as a sure means of social and even material advancement. The Jesuits’ return in 1859 revived the issue of Filipinization. Their earlier, for ced departure in 1768 resulted in vacant curacies, especially in northern Mindanao. With not enough Spanish clergy to go around, these had gone to Filipino secular priests. Now, there was an or der to transfer curacies in the Bishopric of Manila from native clergy to the Spanish religious or ders, to accommodate those displaced by the returning Jesuits. The or der to vacate what they had administered capably for more than ninety years embittered many of the seculars. (They had to give up, for in stance, one of the wealthiest parishes in the colony, that of Antipolo, not far from Manila, and the archipelago’s most famous pilgrimage site devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Voyage.) The of ficial reasons, they felt, disparaged their abilities and cast aspersions on their character. These feelings would persist and lead many secular native priests later on to adopt nationalist causes. A breakdown in 1870 showed that out of a to tal of 792 parishes, 611 were administered by regular priests, i. e., belonging to the Orders, and 181 by secular priests, almost all of whom were Filipino. At the same time, political turmoil continued in Spain. The Spanish revolution of 1868 resulted in the for mation of yet another liberal, democratic form of government. The next year, 1869, the same year the Suez Canal was opened, the Cortes approved a new constitution, which established a limited monarchy; recognized in dividual freedom of expression, association, domicile, and worship; legalized civil marriages; and in troduced the jury system. A wealthy liberal, Carlos María de la Torre, was sent over to the colony as the new governor general. Once in stalled, de la Torre banned flogging in the military, lifted restrictions on the press, public demonstrations, and the for mation of associations aimed at reform, etc. The governor displayed his in tentions for a more democratic dispensation by having creoles and mestizos at the Palace and proposing to asts to “Liberty!” He took the unusual step of pardoning a group of dissidents in nearby Cavite province, who had been in volved in agrarian disputes with local landowners. He had these same dissidents form a police force. De la Torre also went on walks in Intramuros sans the traditional armed escort in their fancy uniforms. Not surprisingly, such behavior scandalized the long-time Spanish expatriates and clergy, who feared this display of liberalism would only encourage the lowly natives to become uppity and entertain ideas of a free society. Naturally the rising bourgeoisie—native and mestizo alike—hailed him. Unfortunately for this budding reform movement, Amadeo of Savoy was in stalled as king, and the leftward shift in Spain was arrested. De la Torre was recalled in 1871, and replaced by a right-winger Rafael de Izquierdo, who promptly restored the restrictions, and viewed with suspicion those who had supported de la Torre’s policies. More tellingly, he also with drew the exemption from tribute and for ced labor (the polos y servicios ) that the workers at the Cavite arsenal, the artillery barracks and engineer corps of Fort San Felipe—just across the bay from Intramuros—had enjoyed since 1740. The abolition of these privileges caused the men in the fort to mutiny on January 20, 1872. Though seven Spanish of ficers were killed, the mini-revolt, never more than a brushfire, was quickly suppressed over a period of two days, but the in cident was viewed as more than just a violent act of in subordination. Here was an opportunity to get rid of Filipino secular priests who had championed the Filipinization of the clergy—an in sistent demand seen at the for efront of in cipient nationalism. This demand had grown to in clude not only the native clerics but Creoles and Spanish mestizos as well. Among those swept into the net of suspected subversives were figures of social standing and three secular priests: Mariano Gómez, curate of the nearby town of Bacoor, Cavite; Jacinto Zamora, parish priest of Marikina Town, a suburb north of Manila; and José Burgos, a curate at the prestigious Manila Cathedral. Of the three, the most well-known was Fr. Burgos, one of the most vocal and in fluential champions of the Filipino secular clergy and who had made his views known to de la Torre. Born in 1837, he was at the age of thirty already a doctor of the ology and canon law, and the Synodal Examiner of the country’s preeminent See—the Cathedral of Manila. He was also an expert swordsman and knew how to box. Tireless in his advocacy of Filipinizing the parishes and in defense of his fellow Filipino priests, in 1869 Burgos penned “To the Spanish People.” Reading this eloquent essay, one can see why the Spanish friars detested him. He rebutted the baseless charges levied against the secular priests by La Verdad, or The Truth, a newspaper that clearly favored the entrenched Spanish clergy"

He rebutted the baseless charges levied against the secular priests by La Verdad, or The Truth, a newspaper that clearly favored the entrenched Spanish clergy. He cited the main charge: “‘… the Filipino who dedicates himself to the sacred of fice of the priesthood is wont to carry out faithfully and well the mechanical detail of church work but he never at tains to the point of excelling in anything connected with the solemn priestly functions.’” Burgos highlighted the friars’ refusal to obey royal decrees, especially that of 1863, commanding them to teach Spanish to their constituents. “So resolutely do the friars carry their in tentions to its undue lengths that they come to abhor in their parish the native who speaks Spanish.” He described the friars as “sand in the cog wheels of the country’s civilization” who “endeavor to keep the poor natives in a state of ignorance and boorishness”—the better to maintain both their in fluence and affluence. To for estall charges of treason, of being a filibustero, or subversive, he highlighted the secular priests’ services in the past, declared that their abilities were equal to the best of the friars, and reiterated above all how loyal the secular clergy was to Mother Spain. If only the motherland would open her eyes and see, she would recognize in stantly the great in justice that was being perpetuated. He accused the friar or ders of being in “possession of great riches and profitable estate in comes which they do their best to keep away from the eyes of the government,” riches that were “now unhappily available at all times and is too of ten put to ill use, in the in dulgence of pleasure, in the transgression of the law, in the corruption of justice and in the in fliction of harm to their fellowmen.” Strong, provocative words. In essence, Burgos had written a with ering critique of not just the Spanish friars but colonialism itself, for colonial rule had prospered precisely because it condoned the friars’ methods. Confrontation with the friars was in evitable, though things would not come to a head for two more decades. Spain justified her presence in the islands—in deed throughout her empire—based on the evangelical belief in Catholicism’s superiority and the imperative to spread it. Even though this religion brought over from Spain had sunk its roots deep in Philippine soil, the different localized resistance movements that rose out of deep despair, with the well of native for bearance running dry, had no choice but to see the friar as the main obstacle to freedom and, since the friar too was key to local economic development, material progress. Catholic the ology was acceptable, but its Iberian herald was in creasingly unwelcome. In a mock trial, and implicated by one mutineer, the clerics were promptly found guilty of plotting to overthrow the regime. Significantly, Archbishop Martínez of Manila refused to defrock them, an implicit endorsement of their professed in nocence, as well as a pointed rebuke of the friar or ders, who continually resisted the diocesan bishop’s right to visitation—a mechanism provided by the Patronato Real, through which oversight by the Royal Crown was exercised. On February 17, 1872, a month after the failed mutiny, Gómez, Burgos, and Zamora were publicly executed at the Luneta by means of the garrote, an iron collar bound around the condemned’s neck and then twisted until the neck is broken. Burgos, the last to be killed, shouted out his declaration of in nocence, to which one of the at tending friars is said to have chillingly remarked, “So was Jesus.” Ironically, the mutineer who had implicated the trio in the hopes of being pardoned or at least spared the death penalty, a man by the name of Saldua, was garroted as well. Others were imprisoned and twenty-two others, in cluding nine native priests, were banished to the Marianas Islands. A few of the banished laymen managed to make their way to Europe, among them Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and Antonio Regidor, who, along with other Filipino émigrés, for med the nucleus of an expatriate community that the later generation of Filipino upper-middle class in tellectuals would join. That the trials were patently unfair is clear in the rebuke the Supreme Military Council in Madrid (the highest military tribunal) delivered to the colonial government in Manila, stating that its conduct was a violation of the law, and warning against a repeat. No punishment was decreed, however, for such a violation. The Cavite Mutiny anticipated a much larger one when, on September 2 of the same year, close to 1,200 laborers in the same Cavite shipyards, according to Benedict Anderson in Under Three Flags, “went on the first recorded strike in Philippine history. Numerous people were arrested and in terrogated but the regime failed to find an arrestable mastermind and eventually all were released.” The peaceable strike was to protest the suspension of their privileges—the very same cause that sparked the brief armed in surrection. There was a practical side to the stirrings of nationalism. Their widening economic in terests made the colonized more aware of and sensitive to antiquated and unfair colonial policies, abetted by systemic racism and the denial of freedoms. This blatant oppression of liberal creoles, mestizos, and native clerics, though at other times strange bedfellows, resulted in a common cause being taken up. The drive to Filipinize the parishes was easily subsumed into the larger context of widespread discontent and the desire for substantial reforms.

No longer; they could be seen as anti-exploitation and even anti-Spanish but not as heretics. After all, they had priests on their side. Their souls were the refore not at risk of being damned, as the friars of ten warned those whom they deemed in sufficiently subservient. The 1872 Gomburza Affair, as it came to be known, planted the seeds of nationalist awakening in and politicized the younger generation, already exposed to Enlightenment ideas. In less than a decade, beginning in 1880, the Propaganda Movement would coalesce when Marcelo H. del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, and José Rizal—with other like-minded and older compatriots who had sought refuge in Europe earlier—systematically advocated for reforms. The Propagandists gave voice and shape to the growing aspirations of not just their social class but of the lower classes who, as always, felt most keenly the boot of social and economic oppression. In the end, though the Propaganda Movement failed to at tain its objectives, it did lead to a heightened consciousness among various social classes, culminating in the 1896 Revolution against Spain. (One in dication of how the martyrdom of the three clerics still resonated more than two decades later was the use of “Gomburza” as a password among the revolutionaries.) The Chinese Mestizos Even as a nationalist consciousness was emerging, fuelled by ilustrado aims and the unruly dreams of a restless populace grown both tired and testy due to habitual Spanish repression, the Chinese community was itself undergoing changes as many of its members, assimilating into native society, came to play an in creasingly crucial role in the colonial economy. One way to assimilate was to convert to Catholicism, and adopt a Christian name. By 1755, Chinese mestizos—usually the of fspring of a Chinese father and native mother—came to dominate rice trading, supplying Manila with much of its needs. They the refore acquired farm lands or leased from the religious estates. In turn, the Chinese mestizos, either as owners or in quilinos (lessees), allowed kasamas or sharecroppers to till the soil, in exchange for half of the harvest. A vast majority of the tenant farmers had once owned their small farms but, failing to acquire titles to the land they and their families had worked for generations, lost them. A law passed in 1894 was particularly disastrous: landowners were given only one year in which to secure titles. A great number of small landowners, especially in the rural areas, were unaware of the new law. Not surprisingly, not much effort was made to spread news of this legislation. To their dismay their plots were suddenly in corporated in the titles secured by big landowners. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at least 400,000 persons found the mselves in this predicament, unable to avoid the humbling status of tenancy. From the amassing of lands came the haciendas. The hacienda was an outgrowth of the new system that emphasized the cultivation of cash crops. Though modern in its or ientation to wards capitalism, management was decidedly feudal in the way overseers treated the tenant farmers and itinerant laborers who showed up every harvest—an exploitative system that continues to day. While it is true that debt slavery and sharecropping existed even in the pre-Hispanic period, it is just as true that under the Spanish these exploitative aspects were not only exacerbated but in stitutionalized as well. One of the biggest was the Hacienda Luisita, to taling close to 16,000 acres and encompassing lands in several to wns in what is now Tarlac Province. Originally deeded as a royal grant to the Tabacalera Company in 1880, it was eventually acquired by the Chinese mestizo family, the Cojuangcos, who have since figured as a political and social dynasty nationwide (the successor to president-turned- dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 was a member of the Cojuangco clan: Corazon Cojuangco Aquino). As in quilinos—Rizal’s father was one—many Chinese mestizos grew wealthy, and along with their wealth and accumulated land, became vested in the on going development of the economy. They competed with alcalde mayors or provincial governors, the religious or ders, and the ethnically pure Chinese in positioning the mselves economically. Along with their new economic power, the Chinese mestizos acquired social status, facilitating assimilation and participation as part of the non-Spanish elite of society. In the emergence of a Filipino nation, this elite—a mixture of Chinese mestizos, Creoles, and the rising native middle and upper classes—played a crucial role. In effect, they constituted the new principalia. Inevitably, their ever-in creasing desire for economic expansion, equated with a freer marketplace, kept bumping against the narrow, monopolistic policies of the old regime. Combined with the burgeoning sense of nationalism and the centuries-old resentments of the in dios, the restlessness of the economic elite proved to be an explosive factor. Out of these volatile elements emerged a tangible sense of being a Filipino and the notion of a nation-state to which such Filipinos might belong—an “imagined community,” to use Benedict Anderson’s apt phrase. The term “Filipino” was or iginally applied only to Creoles—Spaniards born in the Philippines. The Spaniards who had come over from the motherland didn’t care for the designation, preferring in stead the term “Peninsulares,” implying a snobbish hierarchy. Anyone outside these two categories was simply an Indio— the term or iginally used by Columbus for the natives of the Caribbean, which he mistook for the Indies, or Spice Islands, of Asia"

However, due to economic progress and a growing sense of a common cultural Hispanicized background that cut across ethnic boundaries, the Creoles, the mestizos (both Chinese and Spanish), and the educated natives came to view the mselves as “Filipinos.” The ilustrados were at the for efront of extending the term to all local in habitants of Las Islas Filipinas—except for the Muslims, or Moros, who had never identified with the Christian majority and in deed resisted the in cursions of the colonial state. T HE P ROPAGANDA M OVEMENT In Spain, in the meantime, political changes continued apace. In 1871 Amadeo, son of King Victor Emmanuel of Italy, was of fered and accepted the job of King of Spain but proved unable to rule effectively. Shortly after an assassination at tempt on his queen, he stepped down in February of 1873. After two years of political turbulence, Alfonso, son of the previously deposed Queen Isabella, gained the Spanish throne, his reign, from 1875 to 1885, a period of relative calm. The Cortes was revived and passed a new constitution in 1876. While Cuba and Puerto Rico were once again given representation, the Philippines was not; the Asian colony was to be governed by a set of special laws. Thus, political changes and upheavals in Spain would be followed in evitably by shakeups in the Philippines, which had become a dumping ground for largely unqualified followers and favorites of well-connected patrons in the motherland. Such changes were superficial and frequent, as can be gauged by the fact that from 1850 to 1898, twenty-four governors general served in the Philippines, for an average term of two years. Plus ça change, plus c’est le meme chose: The purported changes only meant more of the same, with the colonial system plagued by corruption and systemic abuse. Real and abiding power lay in the hands of the civil administrators, especially the governor general, who had essentially dictatorial powers, and of the friar or ders. They usually ignored, or in terpreted narrowly, decrees from Madrid that they didn’t like. Thus, the in junction to teach Spanish archipelago-wide to the Indios was observed haphazardly by the religious, who controlled education in the islands. Compounding the situation were the unabashedly racist views held by the Spanish of ficials, who tended to be domineering, contemptuous, and of ten physically abusive to wards the Indio. This was especially true at the local level, none more abusive than the Guardia Civil, notorious for manhandling villagers who may not have displayed the proper at titude of obeisance (like doffing their salakots, or native hats, promptly). Rizal’s mother herself was for ced to trek fifty kilometers from Calamba to the provincial capital Santa Cruz, where she was kept in jail on charges, never proven, by the mayor in collusion with the head of the local Guardia Civil. She had been falsely implicated as an accomplice in a purported plot, never proven, by her half-brother to poison his wife. In 1880, two years before he set sail for Europe, the son himself felt literally the heavy hand of authority. In a letter Rizal wrote of “being mauled and wounded one dark night by the Guardia Civil, for having passed by a statue and failing to salute it. The statue turned out to be the lieutenant commander of the detachment.” Rizal at tempted to report this in justice to Primo de Rivera, the governor general at the time, but was unable to see him. While the refore gains had been made in trade and commerce (though still at the neglect of the in dustrial sector, which was in an embryonic state), and while in frastructure and communications had improved, no comparable gains had been made in the arena of personal and political freedoms. The gap between material progress and civil liberties was one the in tellectuals and visionaries fervently sought to close. The Propaganda Movement, an outgrowth of the 1872 Mutiny, was a crusade carried out clandestinely in Manila and openly in Spain by scions from the expanding ranks of the native bourgeoisie. This movement, while directly a result of the killings of the three martyr priests, can be traced further back, according to the writer Nick Joaquin, to the waning years of the eighteenth century. A number of Creole writers in the colony espoused the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. They were anti-clerical and pushed for the same reforms the ilustrados would lobby to wards the end of the nineteenth century. In particular, Luis Rodríguez Varela was the writer who, in Joaquin’s words, “can most truly be called the precursor of Philippine nationalism.” Varela called himself “El Conde Filipino” or the Filipino Count, and was the first to describe himself as a Filipino in print. (It is true the Creoles were described as “Filipinos” by the peninsular Spanish but the Creoles the mselves until Varela preferred to be called “Spaniards.”) He wrote several books that advocated social change and the liberalizing of education to in clude free in struction for the poor. He was also critical of the economic power wielded by for eign elements, notably the Chinese, and in directly of the peninsulares as well. He was the reafter viewed with suspicion, marked as a man who would undermine the ruling or der. He was expelled from the colony in February of 1823.

The aim of the Propagandists was to put pressure on the Spanish government by spotlighting for the Spanish public the in justices and backwardness of Spanish rule in the archipelago. The hoped-for result, however, was to be meaningful reforms, assimilation rather than a separation from Mother Spain, wherein Filipinos had standing equal to any other Spaniard. The Propagandists were especially keen on abrogating the role of the friar or ders in civil government, removing them from their curacies, and replacing them with Filipino secular priests. In Spain, they allied the mselves with anti-clerical factions. Testimony by Fr. Juan Villegas, a Franciscan, before the Philippine Commission in 1900, at the start of the United States colonial era, catalogued the powers that his confrères wielded during Spanish colonial times: “He was in spector of primary schools; president of the health board and board of charities; president of the board of urban taxation.… He certified to the correctness of cedulas [tax certificates] … was president of the board of statistics…. The priest also certified as to the civil status of persons.” Before the same commission, a certain Florentino Torres stated: “The local authorities took no step, obeyed no superior or ders and did not perform the duties of their of fice with out previous advice, permission, or knowledge of the friar curate, since the protection of the latter sufficed at times to defy the anger of the governor of the province and paralyze or evade the action of justice.” Such evidentiary testimony bore out the fictional world eloquently detailed two decades earlier in Rizal’s novels. In summary, as the historian Reynaldo Ileto put it, in his Filipinos and Their Revolution, “The Spanish priest was the equivalent of the god-king elsewhere in Southeast Asia.” Thus, notwithstanding their excesses, the friars constituted the de facto bulwark of Spanish colonial rule and were the refore in dispensable. To further solidify their in dispensability, the friars resisted any systematic at tempt for the Indios to learn Spanish. The main reason the friars so assiduously learned the various native languages was so that only they could mediate between the in digenous population and the civil state. The very act of mediating, the ability to move in both spheres at the same time, conferred upon them a great deal of power. For in the eyes of the civil authorities, the alternative—allowing native priests to control most curacies—would mean opening the floodgates of nationalism. Originally the slur against the native priest was his alleged in competence. Now, he was grudgingly perceived as being in telligent but his loyalty to Mother Spain was doubtful. He was likely to be seditious, and, as a high of ficial put it, either “a disgrace for the clergy or … a peril for the colony.” And yet, the ilustrados saw the mselves as faithful sons of Spain, in a sense, more Spanish than the Spanish. To them, the friars and other avatars of colonial rule were the unfaithful subjects, the subversives. Echoing the plaints of Fr. Burgos, the ilustrados believed that if only the mother country saw them in a positive light and extended to them and to the rest of the Indios the same rights as their brothers in the Iberian Peninsula, then all would be set right. Three groups for med the nucleus of the Propaganda Movement. There were those who, having been implicated in the 1872 Mutiny and exiled to the Marianas Islands, had made their way to Europe; a decade later came young men seeking higher education; and third were those fleeing persecution in the colony. The nucleus of the Filipino expatriate community in Madrid counted among its earliest members Gregorio Sancianco and the Paterno brothers. Coming from a well-to-do family in the colony, the Paternos held a regular salon at their residence for writers and political figures. One of the brothers, Pedro, was a poet, the the mes of whose collection of verse, titled Sampaguita y Poesias, published in 1880, were specifically Filipino. Except for the fact that this was the first such book by a Filipino, the verses were apparently for gettable. Pedro also penned a novel, Ninay, that, like Sampaguita, failed to garner any critical praise. Published in 1907, Ninay did have the distinction of being the first novel written in Tagalog. A Chinese mestizo, Sancianco, on the other hand, wrote El Progreso de Filipinas in 1881, a study that examined Philippine colonial society from the standpoint of material progress. Not surprisingly, its author concluded that due to corruption and backward economic and social policies, the country had shown very little development. Government services and the country’s in frastructure demanded radical improvements. The tax structure was highly in equitable, and the tribute levied on the Indios was both racist and unfair. He pointed out that those with the least had to pay the most, while the tribute was demanded of everyone in the Philippines, except the Spanish, whether peninsular or in sular. The tribute had to be abolished and the present tax system replaced by one directly related to the ability to pay. Since the colony should be considered a province of Spain, it followed that its in habitants were to be viewed as Spanish citizens and treated accordingly. Sancianco also assailed the monopoly the religious had over education in the colony. He said students wished for a more rational and secular curriculum, and suggested that the civil government rather than the church take over the tasks of schooling. Though largely ignored, Sancianco’s critique of the Philippines under Spanish rule was accurate, its the mes propounded later on by ilustrado writers such as Rizal, who occasionally referred to him in his letters.

The Propaganda Movement had reformist rather than revolutionary goals. Among these were: recognition of the colony as a province of Spain; equal treatment of Filipinos; freedom of the press; curtailment of Guardia Civil abuses; representation in the Cortes; and secularization of the parishes. Its main mouthpiece was La Solidaridad, a for tnightly first published in Barcelona in February of 1889 and for six years, until late 1895, functioned as the mouthpiece of the Propaganda Movement. Financed by contributions from the Comité de Propaganda, a Manila-based group, La Solidaridad put forth the demands of the Propaganda Movement, singling out the friars as major obstacles to meaningful reform. As the maiden issue put it, the movement’s aim was to “combat reaction … be receptive to liberal principles … and propagate democratic ideals.” The paper also printed news about events in the colony, and political views of leading Spanish politicians on the Philippines. The Propagandists had aims similar to that of a Madrid group, the Asociación Hispano-Filipino, founded on January 12, 1889, principally by a Spanish academic Miguel Morayta. However, the Propagandists, being younger, felt the Madrid group (made up of Españoles Filipinos, mostly retired Spaniards who had once lived in the Philippines) was too accommodating of the authorities. The Asociación did lobby successfully for the passage of some laws such as mandating the teaching of Spanish. Nevertheless, the Asociación and the Propagandists lobbied jointly for their common objectives, e. g., representation in the Cortes, the lifting of censorship of the press, and an end to the arbitrary deportation of colony residents with out due process. Three Filipino expatriates for med the heart of both the publication and the movement: Graciano López Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and José Rizal. All three wrote for La Solidaridad; Rizal, writing in the journal, addressed the Spanish government: “If you persist in your system of banishments, in carcerations, and assaults with out cause, if you punish them for your own faults, you make them despair, you remove their abhorrence for revolutions and turmoils, you harden them and you arouse them to struggle.” López Jaena was the editor for its first eight months, before handing over the editorial reins to del Pilar. Back in the islands, López Jaena had penned a satire whose principal character was a Fray (or Friar) Botod. Botod in López Jaena’s native Hiligaynon—a major Visayan language—means full-bellied and was a none-too-subtle reference to the corpulent lifestyle and avarice of the friars. The work pilloried all the shortcomings of the Spanish clergy. Even though the tale circulated only in zamizdat form, its notoriety drew unfavorable clerical at tention, prompting in López Jaena a sudden and in tense curiosity about life in Spain. He had a reputation as a skillful or ator and for having contacts among Spanish liberals and Masons, most if not all of whom were anti-clerical. Unfortunately, López Jaena had a fondness for the bottle, hardly helpful to regularly putting out a publication. After a brief but disastrous visit to the islands, López Jaena returned to Spain. He had become a hack, at one point writing for a Spanish broadsheet that was critical of the Propagandists. He died, penniless and a consumptive, in Barcelona, at the age of forty. Del Pilar, a lawyer from the Tagalog province of Bulacan, whose brother, a secular priest, had been deported to the Marianas in the wake of the 1872 mutiny, and who wrote under the pseudonym of Plaridel, was the real force behind La Solidaridad, soliciting articles from various correspondents, raising funds, writing for the journal itself, and finally taking over the editorial reins from López Jaena. He had also published in 1882 the broadsheet Diariong Tagalog ( Tagalog Daily )—the first such publication in the islands. It lasted for only three months. He was an early defender of Rizal’s first novel, Noli Me Tangere. Due to his satirical pamphlets, written in Tagalog—unlike the works of Rizal, who wrote his novels in Spanish, a fact which meant a majority of Filipinos couldn’t read him (only five percent of the population was fluent in Spanish)—del Pilar was for ced to flee the colony in early 1889. Del Pilar parodied, for in stance, the Ten Commandments and the tyranny of the friars. His First Commandment was “Worship the Friar Above All Else.” The Fifth Commandment, “Do Not Kill,” became “Thou Shalt Not Die Without Having Sufficient Funds for a Funeral”—an unambiguous reference to the unsavory friar-practice of charging parishioners fees for administering such sacraments as Extreme Unction. His parody of the Lord’s Prayer is especially acerbic and begins with “Our Substitute Father, who art in the convent, cursed be your name, your greed be taken away from us, your throat cut open on earth as it is in heaven.” Hardly words to warm a friar’s heart—or belly. Other figures who moved around in reformist circles in Spain were Mariano Ponce, who assisted López Jaena and del Pilar with La Solidaridad, and contributed articles to the publication; the painters Juan Luna and Félix Resurrecíon Hidalgo; and Antonio Luna, Juan’s brother and future general in the Philippine-American War of 1899. Both painters were critical successes on the continent, Luna’s Spoliarium winning a gold medal at a prestigious art exposition in Madrid in 1884, and Hidalgo’s Virgenes Cristianas winning the silver. After being acquitted in Paris of shooting his wife and mother-in-law fatally in a jealous rage—a case that provoked widespread scandal—Juan Luna returned to the colony in 1894"

Other figures who moved around in reformist circles in Spain were Mariano Ponce, who assisted López Jaena and del Pilar with La Solidaridad, and contributed articles to the publication; the painters Juan Luna and Félix Resurrecíon Hidalgo; and Antonio Luna, Juan’s brother and future general in the Philippine-American War of 1899. Both painters were critical successes on the continent, Luna’s Spoliarium winning a gold medal at a prestigious art exposition in Madrid in 1884, and Hidalgo’s Virgenes Cristianas winning the silver. After being acquitted in Paris of shooting his wife and mother-in-law fatally in a jealous rage—a case that provoked widespread scandal—Juan Luna returned to the colony in 1894. Shortly after the revolution against Spain broke out in August of 1896, Luna was implicated and imprisoned, only to be released in 1897. In 1899, he was named a member of a delegation to the United States by the Philippine revolutionary government, headed by Emilio Aguinaldo, to make a case for in dependence, but the painter died of a heart at tack in Hong Kong. J OSÉ R IZAL Born in 1861, José Rizal could converse in ten languages and corresponded in six. The most charismatic and well-known member of the Propaganda Movement, Rizal was also a medical doctor, scientist, fencer, and writer who brilliantly articulated the dreams and buried hurts fueling the newfound nationalism. His older brother, Paciano, had been a protégé of Fr. Burgos and had been living with the latter when he was implicated in the Cavite Mutiny. Paciano had described the grisly executions to the young José, eleven years old at the time, which undoubtedly helped shape his later views. Rizal would write the staff of La Solidaridad: “Without 1872 there would now be neither Plaridel nor Jaena nor Sancianco, nor the valiant and generous Filipino expatriates in Europe. Without 1872, Rizal would have been a Jesuit and in stead of writing the Noli Me Tangere, would in stead have written something entirely different.” Coming from an upper middle-class family in Calamba Town in Laguna Province, not far from Manila, and whose patriarch, Francisco Mercado, was an in quilino who farmed large tracts of friar land, José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso was a precocious child, the favorite of his mother Teodora Alonso, a sophisticated and devout woman who believed in the virtues of a good education and taught the young boy to read and write even before he started his for mal schooling. A prodigious and disciplined learner, Rizal easily shone in the lower grades and, with nothing more to learn in the local schools, was sent to Manila at the age of eleven, to continue his studies, first, at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Manila and, later, at the Dominican University of Santo Tomás. He moved to the city as José Rizal, “Rizal” being a second surname, and a variant of the Spanish ricial, meaning pasture land. His family feared that if he bore the patronym of Mercado, he would be linked to his older brother Paciano and thus in directly to Fr. Burgos. Higher education, in which he excelled, graduating summa cum laude from the Ateneo, and during which he was awarded literary prizes for his writing in Spanish, only fed his hunger for broader horizons, which he, along with his generation, knew were not available in the stultifying at mosphere of a conservative dispensation that looked down on Indios. At the age of twenty-one, in 1882, he sought those horizons in Europe. He quickly became part of the Filipino community of students, in tellectuals, and political exiles in Spain, and was soon one of the leaders of the Propaganda Movement. Rizal published his first novel, the Spanish-language Noli Me Tangere, in 1887. The novel is a powerful and searing in dictment of corruption and abuse in the colony, particularly among the friar or ders who epitomized to the novelist as they did to most Filipinos the venality, moral blindness, and arrogance of colonial rule. The novel was banned in the colony—having a copy was grounds for being charged with subversion—but circulated clandestinely. The author returned to Manila for a visit in 1888, one cut short when his family, fearful for his safety, persuaded him to leave. By then, Rizal had acquired something of a rock star’s popularity, of ten followed by crowds when he was seen in public, deepening the distrust the authorities had of this ilustrado. Returning to Europe, after watching Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show in Paris in 1889, Rizal and his companions were impressed by the dignity and agility of the American Indian performers. They decided, part in jest, part in all seriousness, to call the mselves “Los Indios Bravos,” claiming a term the colonizer meant disparagingly as a badge of honor, a way of empowering the mselves. In London, Rizal annotated Sucesos de Las Islas Filipinas, by Dr. Antonio de Morga, a 1609 Spanish account of pre-Hispanic culture, to show that a thriving sophisticated culture existed before the advent of the Spanish. He went on to write El Filibusterismo ( The Subversive ), a sequel to the Noli and published in 1891. Rizal felt the second novel was darker and more profound than the Noli. Dedicated to Gómez, Burgos, and Zamora, the Fili (as it is popularly known) concerns its wealthy protagonist, Simoun, disillusioned by the failed reforms he has championed, plotting a violent uprising, and recruiting young men to his cause. The plot fails, however, and the would-be revolutionary kills himself. Just as with the Noli, the second novel added fuel to the fire of friar hatred directed at Rizal, and was proscribed as well. La Liga Filipina and the Katipunan After his stay in London, during which he was made honorary president of La Solidaridad, Rizal decided to carry on the struggle for reforms back in the colony. He likened it to a doctor visiting the sick patient. He left Europe for good, and sailed for Hong Kong in October of 1891, where he waited to see how the political winds blew in Manila. In the British colony, he seriously explored the Utopian possibility of establishing a Filipino community in Sandakan, Borneo. He wanted to create a sanctuary for himself and his family, as well as the people of Calamba, his hometown, who had been dispossessed of their lands by the Dominican friars"

He wanted to create a sanctuary for himself and his family, as well as the people of Calamba, his hometown, who had been dispossessed of their lands by the Dominican friars. Even though the British North Borneo Charter Company was amenable to having these prospective immigrants settle on 5,000 acres of land, rent-free for three years, the financial costs in volved and the almost certain refusal of the Spanish colonial government to allow such a move in the end doomed Rizal’s endeavor to have the country come to him rather than he to the country. He decided to proceed to Manila by late June of 1892. Barely a week after his arrival he founded La Liga Filipina, its aim to disseminate the Propaganda Movement’s call for reformist, nonviolent ideals. Among other goals, La Liga Filipina advocated the unification of the archipelago into a political and cultural whole; development of agriculture, education and in dustry; and the eradication of in justice. Though these were hardly radical aims, the existence of the league provided the excuse his powerful enemies had been waiting for, and they complained to Governor General Despujol. On his or ders, Rizal was arrested just four days after La Liga’s in itial meeting. The government exiled him to Dapitan, a coastal town and Jesuit mission in northwest Mindanao and far from Manila. His enforced departure from Manila on July 15, 1892, effectively ended the reformist movement. Rizal’s four years in exile turned out to be some of the most peaceful in his life. In Dapitan, he set up a water system, a school for boys, and an eye clinic as well, where he treated the residents of the town for free. In the square fronting the town church, he constructed an earthen relief map of Mindanao. It was in Dapitan where he met the young Josephine Bracken, an Irish-Chinese mestiza who had accompanied her stepfather from Hong Kong to Dapitan so the latter could be operated on by Rizal, whose fame as an ophtalmologist had spread beyond national boundaries. Bracken would be his lover and companion in this last period of his life. O N THE E VE OF THE R EVOLUTION This last decade of the nineteenth century is unprecedented. Chaos, social upheaval, disease, hunger, and senseless deaths, but also hopes, dreams, a sudden sense of new direction—birth pangs of a nascent nation, death throes of an all but extinct for mal colonial or der. On the global stage, an aging empire is dying, and a new one is about to rise from its ashes. In that age of turbulence, life goes on for the Filipino, but now he begins to imagine himself in terms of a national identity, and regardless has a storehouse of customs—but customs that reflect an improvisatory sense, the different facets, the different streams, of life in the Philippines at the time, blending then as now the in digenous and the for eign, the alien and the familiar, in a word, “Filipinizing” them. In 1894 the population of the colony was estimated, based on parish registration, to be between 6 million and 7 million. To these need to be added about a million non-Christians, such as the in digenous tribes of the in terior, the Chinese, the Mindanao Muslims, and for eigners residing in the colony. The 1894 tally also counted 2,751 religious and lay clergy, and 21,513 military personnel. Of the latter, fewer than three thousand were Spanish; the rest were native conscripts. By the close of the century the peninsulares were believed to number approximately twenty thousand. If the native had changed, if his or her way of life had been altered, not so the apparatus of colonial administration. The governor general was of course the top of the heap, with two advisory bodies: the Junta de Autoridades, or Board of Authorities, and the Consejo de Administracíon, or Council of Administration. Additionally, there were four types of regional governments: civil; politico- military provinces; politico-military commands; and district commands. There were also the ayuntamientos. In modern parlance these would be metropolitan districts, of which there were eight, Manila being the oldest and largest. Governing an ayuntamiento were two alcaldes en or dinario, elected by Spanish residents; a city council; an alguacil, in charge of peace and or der; and a scrivener, responsible for record keeping and answerable to the governor general and alcalde mayor, or governor of the province. Then came the municipalities, or to wnships, made up of cabecerias de barangay, an agglomeration of barangays, each consisting of forty to fifty families and headed by a cabeza de barangay, or barangay chief. The latter had traditionally been drawn from the ranks of pre-Hispanic datu families but over time were appointed on the recommendation of the municipal government. The gobernadorcillo, or mayor, along with the cabezas de barangay and landowners, made up the principalia. As it is, the feudal system, with all its exploitative features, championed avidly both by the Spanish colonial authorities (except for the occasional liberal governor general) and the religious, remained in tact, essentially unchanged since the conquest that began in the late sixteenth century. Despite reform laws passed in the home country, the colonial administrators could basically pick and choose which features to implement in the islands. An in structive example was the liberalizing measure provided by the Becerra Law of 1889, which provided for the establishment of more ayuntamientos wherever there was civil government. At that time, there were eighteen provinces with a purely civil government, but the then-governor general Valeriano Weyler (1888-91) believed that only in seven of these provinces were there sufficient personnel qualified to carry out the tasks of civil government"

At that time, there were eighteen provinces with a purely civil government, but the then-governor general Valeriano Weyler (1888-91) believed that only in seven of these provinces were there sufficient personnel qualified to carry out the tasks of civil government. Moreover, rather than allowing elections so representatives could be chosen—as provided by the law—Weyler appointed in dividuals he deemed capable (and loyal both to him and to colonial strictures) to these positions. Thus, the very in tent of the law, of providing an opportunity for the locals to acquire exposure and training in self-government no matter how limited, was thwarted. In contrast, Puerto Rico already had some form of elections while Cuba had the status of an assimilated province. Before the outbreak of the Spanish- American War of 1898, there were already two major political parties in Puerto Rico, the Incondicionales, or Spanish party, and the nativist Autonomist Party. Months before the 1898 war began, the Autonomists won island elections. Thus, the Puerto Ricans enjoyed a certain degree of self-government, but still within the protective embrace of Madrid. In contrast, in the Philippines, any putative at tempts at reform and eventual self-government were stifled, mostly at the behest of the almighty friar or ders that had in essence become the state. Only when the Philippine Revolution of 1896 began were there half-hearted efforts to ward democratic reform, and by then, of course, these were meaningless. Nor had colonial rule meant a significant transformation of the colony from being mainly a source of raw material to one where in dustrialization took firm root. What the Spanish focused on throughout colonial occupation was extraction of whatever was of value in the islands, whether these were precious metals or spices or to bacco, to be sold or traded. As well, the Spanish viewed the islands as a trading conduit in Asia, particularly with regard to China. Even with the in troduction of agricultural machinery and cash crops, the emphasis continued to be trade for short-term purposes rather any far-reaching in dustrialization. Essentially, the Spaniards made most of their for tunes in the Philippines from an extractive economy, to the clear detriment of the local population. It was after all what they had done in their New World colonies, whose immense wealth of raw material—gold and silver—lulled the Spanish into avoiding the path of in dustrialization, and thus were outstripped in this by the Netherlands and Great Britain. In terms of the religious sphere, to wards the end of Spanish occupation, the archipelago was divided into five dioceses: one metropolitan area, Manila, and four suffragan, or subordinate, bishoprics: Nueva Segovia (Vigan), Nueva Caceres (Bicol), Cebu, and Jaro. Each diocese was supposed to oversee the activities of both regular and secular clergies active within its jurisdiction, but time and again the friar or ders, as has been previously described, were well aware of their in dispensable role in colonial government and resisted the right of diocesan visitation—perhaps the most obvious symbol of civil oversight. The regular or ders in the islands were made up of the friaries (the Augustinians, Recollects, Franciscans, and the Dominicans) as well as the Jesuits. The immense wealth the religious or ders accumulated was strikingly evident in their landholdings at the end of the Spanish colonial era. The friars owned almost 400,000 acres, or about one-fifteenth of cultivated land. In Manila and outlying districts, lands owned by the religious to taled more than 110,000 acres. The largest friar hacienda, run by the Dominicans, was in Calamba (where José Rizal’s parents were in quilinos) with 35,000 acres. While the European Propagandists soldiered on in Spain, the government turned a deaf ear to their efforts, though in dividual public of ficials were sympathetic. The fact that the once mighty Spanish empire was now reduced to small island colonies only strengthened the resolve of the Spanish ultranationalists to hold on to the remnants. Consequently, the authority of the Spanish friars in the Philippines was rendered well-nigh impregnable, as they were seen as the main bulwark against nationalist feelings. With the friars as parish priests, the Archbishop of Manila had little to no canonical authority over them. He was for ced to consult the provincials of the four friar or ders on all matters pertaining to the church, thus guaranteeing the depth and continuation of friar in fluence on Philippine society. One of the Liga’s members was a young working-class firebrand and Tondo warehouse worker by the name of Andrés Bonifacio, who revered Rizal. At first Bonifacio worked actively on behalf of the Liga, recruiting members. But the leadership of La Liga, fearful that the new members Bonifacio had brought in were more in clined to revolution than assimilation, dissolved the or ganization. Its more conservative members (mostly from the upper middle class) continued to support the Propagandists in Spain, mainly to ensure publication of La Solidaridad. Bonifacio, on the other hand, as with the newer and more uncompromising members, drawn from the lower middle and working classes, saw reforms, even if they were to be granted by the despotic Spanish regime, as symbolic rather than substantial. Orphaned at an early age, Bonifacio read avidly, keeping abreast of the Propagandists’ activities through La Solidaridad. He had Rizal’s novels; Les Miserables by Victor Hugo; Eugène Sue’s The Wandering Jew; and texts on the French Revolution, in ternational law, and religion. The ideals of the French Revolution, in particular, seemed to have in spired him to think along mass mobilization and the resort to arms"

The ideals of the French Revolution, in particular, seemed to have in spired him to think along mass mobilization and the resort to arms. He had read del Pilar’s satires, and it was the satirist who seemed to have in fluenced Bonifacio ideologically, for the hard-hitting writer was not averse to armed revolution. Bonifacio, along with the new recruits, consequently shifted the or ientation of the mass movement to wards complete in dependence from Spain. He founded in 1892 the secret revolutionary society dedicated to overthrowing the colonial yoke: Ang Kataastaasang Kagalagalangan Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan — the Highest, Most Honorable Society of the Country’s Sons and Daughters, the KKK, or simply the Katipunan. It would be the explosive catalyst that would end Iberian despotism, friar abuse, and establish a free state. Economic conditions exacerbated the social and political oppression suffered by the vast majority of the populace. There was a sizeable lumpenproletariat in Manila, made up of thousands of workers, drawn there (as to day) by the possibility of jobs, whether in the to bacco in dustry, in the port area, or in other factories that had sprung up due to in creased trade and demands for Philippine raw materials. In the countryside, the growing landlessness in creased the ranks of tenant farmers now working plots of land they had once owned but had had taken away from them by the manipulations of friar estates, unscrupulous landowners, and the rapidly rising class of Chinese mestizos. Landlessness of course prompted many to simply pack up and seek their for tune in the cities. The Katipunan didn’t lack for recruits. With many of its leaders members of Masonic lodges (Rizal himself was a Mason, with his Masonic name being Dimasalang, a Tagalog approximation of Noli Me Tangere ), would-be revolutionaries underwent in itiation rites that had a Masonic tinge. They were blindfolded and led to a dimly lit room that had a skull, a revolver, and a cutlass. If the applicant responded satisfactorily to questions put to him, he was then in itiated into the secret society by means of a blood compact. From an in cision in his arm, the in itiate drew blood to write his name. The in itiate also took on a new name—his nom de guerre. The newly in ducted member would in itially belong to the first of three Katipunan ranks, the Katipun. He could aspire to the next higher level, the Kawal (or Warrior), and the nce the highest, the Bayani (Hero). The Katipunan stressed brotherhood and ethical behavior. Many of its tenets clearly reflected the legacies of the Enlightenment and both the American and French revolutions: All men were equal and no one was superior to anyone else in terms of human dignity; the oppressed needed to be defended against the oppressor; and a man was great because he neither oppressed nor aided the oppressor and knew how to love and defend his country. Anticipating both the modernist feminist revolution and Mao Tse-Tung’s maxim that “women hold up half of heaven,” while also reflecting pre-Hispanic values, one tenet declared women to be partners, companions who shouldered equally the burdens of life. In the Katipunan’s Cartilla, or Primer, written by Emilio Jacinto—Bonifacio’s university-educated adviser who refused to give up the struggle even after Bonifacio’s execution by his soon-to-be-rival General Emilio Aguinaldo—the revolutionary society enjoined its members to “consider your wife not as a mere plaything, but as a partner, a companion in the hardships of life; be considerate to wards her weakness and think of the mother that cared for you in your childhood. What you would not want others do to your wife, daughter, and sister, do not do to the wife, daughter, and sister of another.” That the Katipunan explicitly referred to how women should be treated reflected the fact that the vital social role of women had enjoyed prior to colonial rule had continually been under assault by the aggressive patriarchal at titudes and values espoused by the Spanish, most in tensely and consistently by the religious or ders. These men of the cloth, reflecting the ultra-masculine ethos of Roman Catholicism by way of Inquisitorial Spain, saw the essentially egalitarian relationships between the sexes as aberrations, if not abominations. For women such as the babaylan to be the mediators between the visible world and that of the spirit; to be perceived as healers; to be called upon as a villager lay dying; for them to have as much right to sexual pleasure as men—all these female prerogatives were anathema to the friars, and a threat to their primacy. Male authority had to reign supreme, whether in matrimony, government, or religion. By the time of the 1896 Revolution, the “good” Filipina was a paragon of modesty, keeper of repressed longings, and unswervingly faithful to the men in her life, whether to the husband, son, or Christ on the cross. With the Katipunan, there was a deliberate effort to do away with the restrictions on women’s roles.

The Katipunan grew rapidly, and though Manila was rife with rumors about the existence of a revolutionary society, no hard evidence could be produced. Governor General Ramón Blanco consequently dismissed the reports as the paranoid musings of the friars. That hard evidence was supplied when a low- ranking disgruntled Katipunero Teodoro Patiño unburdened himself to his devoutly Catholic sister about plans for an armed uprising. The in for mation quickly reached the curate of the Tondo parish, Fr. Mariano Gil. The friar convinced Patiño (most likely under threat of excommunication), a typesetter at the newspaper, Diario de Manila, to lead him to the of fices and show him where papers and other paraphernalia pertaining to the Katipunan had been hidden. The untimely discovery for ced the Katipunan to proclaim the need for revolution on August 23, 1896 at a place called Pugad Lawin (Hawk’s Nest), at the home of Melchora Aquino, a self-taught eighty-four-year-old widow who fed, housed, and otherwise took care of the Katipuneros when fighting broke out. The grand dame of the revolution, she was known affectionately as Tandang Sora (Old Sora). Subsequently imprisoned by the Spanish and in terrogated as to Katipunan activities, the octogenarian wouldn’t talk. She was exiled to the Marianas and allowed to return once the United States of America had taken over the country. Still, she refused to pledge allegiance to the United States, and died in 1919 at the age of 107, with American colonial rule firmly in place. In the yard of her home, Bonifacio and his fellow Katipuneros tore up their cedulas, or tax ID certificates, in dicating a decisive split with Spain. (In 1884, a graduated poll tax, known as the cedula personal, was created to replace the age- old tribute. The cedula was proof of payment.) The revolution, in itially confined to the Tagalog provinces, quickly spread to other regions. Attacks against government buildings and garrisons occurred in places such as the Camarines provinces, Zambales, and, to the southwest, Palawan Island. Not surprisingly, Governor General Ramón Blanco proclaimed a state of war. Those suspected of being members of the Katipunan were imprisoned and to rtured, with many being put to death. Among the most notorious in stances of mass execution were two that took place on January 4 and 11, 1897—by then Blanco, perceived by the friars as in sufficiently hawk-like, had been replaced by Camilo Polavieja, a battle-tested veteran who rarely brooked compromise. The first group, consisting of fifteen men, was known as the Bicol Martyrs, after the southern Luzon region whence they hailed or iginally. Included were three secular Filipino clerics. The second group came to be called the Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan, after the site of their execution, now part of Rizal Park. These were men arrested after the Cry at Balintawak on charges of treason, and in cluded civic leaders, professionals, and members of the Katipunan. The most prominent victim of the regime was Dr. José Rizal. The previous year, Rizal had requested permission to act as a volunteer medic with Spanish for ces in Cuba, where revolutionary for ces under José Martí sought in dependence, a revolution that would provide the U. S. the needed pretext of declaring war on Spain. Acting on the suggestion of his Austrian friend and faithful correspondent Ferdinand Blumentritt, Rizal believed his petition would dispel the notion that he was disloyal to Mother Spain. Permission to sail to Cuba was granted in 1896, before the Revolution broke out. Rizal sailed to Manila and there, on September 3, shortly after the Revolution began, boarded a ship for Europe, with letters of recommendation from Governor Blanco. In one, addressed to the Spanish Minister of War, Blanco wrote that Rizal was “in my judgment, more deserving of pardon and benevolence since it appears that he is in no way in volved in the uprising.” Nevertheless, en route—by then the Revolution was in full throttle—on the or ders of the same Blanco, who was under pressure from Spanish military of ficers to bring the physician/novelist back, Rizal was arrested for his alleged role in the uprising. Once in Barcelona, after a short stay in Montjuich Prison, he was sent back to Manila under guard. After imprisonment at Fort Santiago, and a trial closed to the public, Rizal was found guilty of fomenting rebellion. The fact that one of the passwords used by Katipuneros was “Rizal” provided damning circumstantial evidence of his alleged complicity. The irony was that Rizal, while in exile at Dapitan, had been approached in early 1896 by Dr. Pio Valenzuela, an emissary of the Katipunan, seeking his advice and, more importantly, his imprimatur for the planned uprising. Though the protagonist Simoun in his second novel El Filibusterismo had argued that only violence could overthrow the Spanish regime, Rizal believed the country was not yet prepared for such a radical step, that it would only result in the tragic loss of in nocent lives. He in for med Valenzuela that he would not be a party to the impending revolution. Like other members of the Propaganda Movement, he saw evolutionary reform as the gradual but sure way to in dependence. In his stress on nonviolence, Rizal anticipated Gandhi’s policy of passive resistance that proved effective in securing in dependence for the Indian subcontinent. As seen in an iconic photograph of the execution (taken by the Spanish Creole photographer Manuel Arias Rodriguez, whose photo documentation of the conflict between Filipinos and the Spanish is in valuable), at dawn of December 30, 1896, clad in a morning coat and a black bowler hat, Rizal was executed by firing squad at the Luneta. Behind the firing squad made up of Filipinos were Spanish riflemen, ready to gun down the Indios should they refuse to fire. Rizal had asked the of ficer in charge of the firing squad if he could face the riflemen but was denied permission. Upon being hit, eyewitnesses said he managed to twist his body around and fall as he had wanted to: face up"

Upon being hit, eyewitnesses said he managed to twist his body around and fall as he had wanted to: face up. In a possibly apocryphal version of his death—and a testament to how potent a symbol his martyrdom had immediately become—the more moved of the on lookers rushed for ward to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood, now considered sacred. Unbeknownst to his jailers, the day before his execution, Rizal had managed to conceal a document in an alcohol stove he gave to his sister, whispering to her in English that he had something hidden in it. The document turned out to be a poem, Mi Ultimo Adios ( My Last Farewell ), a moving and eloquent record of his thoughts about his country—as well as his love for Josephine Bracken. (Bracken joined the revolutionary army briefly but left the country for Hong Kong in May of 1897.) The poem quickly became famous, its opening line known to every school child in the country: “Adios patria adorada, region del sol querida” (“Farewell, beloved country, land cherished by the sun”). * Aware of how scarce his manpower resources were and how the Cuban Revolution was drawing in more Spanish troops, and with the possibility of native soldiers joining their brother Filipinos in open revolt, Blanco requested a thousand soldiers from Spain and permission to form militias of volunteers drawn from the Spanish community in the colony. Surprisingly more aware of the need for a surge in troops, Madrid sent approximately double the number of soldiers requested. Towards the close of 1896, a little more than two thousand troops disembarked at Manila, almost at the same time as the arrival of Blanco’s successor, Camilo Polavieja. The reinforcements were welcomed as saviors by the Spanish community and by civil and religious authorities in festive, even giddy, rites. In a welcoming speech, the president of the Casino Español, the preeminent Spanish club in Manila, spewed vitriol on the Indio revolutionaries: “You arrive in time; the cannibals of the for est are still there; the wild beast hides in his lair; the hour has come to finish with the savages…. Destroy! Kill! Do not pardon.” Despite the in crease in troop strength, it was too little too late. The repressive measures only stoked the fire of rebellion. To the long-suffering populace, such measures were harsher only by degrees and not substantially different from what they faced in pre-revolutionary times. They were up to the task of enduring whatever the Spanish could throw at them. Too, where ethnic and regional rivalries divided them in the past, now they began to have a sense, even if tenuous, of a collective whole. By the end of the year, the fire of revolution engulfed the country. And while the revolution had still to coalesce effectively, nonetheless it would only be a matter of time before it did. Bonifacio versus Aguinaldo On the ground, Bonifacio, though an in spirational figure, proved to be in effective as a military strategist, his for ces’ at tacks on to wns and garrisons ill- planned and ill-fated. As the revolution blundered on, Boni facio’s reputation diminished almost in reverse proportion as that of another member of the Katipunan, Emilio Aguinaldo, was on the rise. Inducted by Bonifacio into the Katipunan, Aguinaldo was the gobenadorcillo of Kawit Town, in nearby Cavite Province (the same province where the 1872 Mutiny had taken place). Under Aguinaldo’s leadership, the Cavite rebels scored victories against the Spanish. After the in itial successes of the Katipunan in Cavite, Governor General Polavieja, having taken over from Blanco, mounted a counteroffensive that regained ground. The two main factions of the Katipunan in the province— Magdalo, under Aguinaldo, and Magdiwang, pro-Bonifacio—agreed to meet. Bonifacio and some of his staff traveled to the town of Tejeros, where elections were held to determine who should lead the revolution. Along the way, many on lookers hailed Bonifacio as the “King of the Tagalogs,” a testament to his popularity. By this time, however, it was clear to everyone that Aguinaldo was far superior as a military strategist than the Supremo. The added fact that the elections were being held in Cavite, Aguinaldo’s home turf, meant the gathering was dominated by pro-Aguinaldo members. Unsurprisingly, Aguinaldo won the election, while Bonifacio was elected as Minister of Interior, more of a ceremonial of fice. Outmaneuvered and provoked by questions of his competence, and nearly coming to blows with his in terlocutors, Bonifacio, asserting his authority as founder and head of the Katipunan, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Tejeros Convention and stormed out of the hall. Aguinaldo was sworn in as president of the revolutionary government shortly after; his Cabinet took shape, all its members from Cavite, a fact that spoke to how regionalism played a role in Aguinaldo’s consolidation of power. (This would have been obvious to Bonifacio but which he ignored, probably banking on his stature as founder of the Katipunan to outweigh everything else.) The lone exception was General Artemio Ricarte, who hailed from the Ilocos region up north but was now a permanent resident of the province. Bonifacio and his followers continued to oppose the Aguinaldo government even though they were at a disadvantage, not being from the province and the refore having little support there. Even the supposedly pro-Bonifacio Magdiwang wing threw its support behind Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo had him arrested, and the founder of the Katipunan and his brother Procopio were brought to trial before a military court supervised by their now-sworn enemies.

The two were quickly found guilty of sedition and treason. On May 10, 1897, the Bonifacio brothers were executed in the woods of Mt. Buntis. The Supremo’s widow, Gregoria de Jesus, evaded capture and returned to Manila, where she married Julio Nakpil, a Katipunan of ficer loyal to Bonifacio and active in the revolution against Spain. She resumed revolutionary activities, principally deciphering messages sent in code by members of the Katipunan in the field. She also knew how to ride and use firearms, and took part in a number of encounters. The leadership was now firmly in the hands of propertied men, members of the principalia, rather than the working-class for ces that Bonifacio had represented. Would this change the direction of the armed struggle against Spain? Not in the short term, but as the drive for in dependence from a Spain determined to hold on to the vestiges of its once grand empire proved to be complicated, it finally did veer to wards compromise. As Renato Constantino puts it in his A Past Revisited, “There was only one logical outcome of the triumph of the elite. Leading the Revolution meant leading it to suit the desires of those who had in terests to defend. Such a leadership could of fer only a vacillating at titude to wards the enemy.” One Revolution, Two Wars Undisputed as the leader of the revolution, Aguinaldo and his for ces retreated south to Batangas Province, as the Spanish counter-at tacks reclaimed territory. They then moved to Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan Province, north of Manila, where a constitution, based on the Cuban Constitution of Jimaguayu, was drawn up on November 2, 1897, for the republic that had been founded earlier that April, in Cavite province. A little more than a month after, however, through the mediation of Pedro Paterno (author of Sampaguita and Ninay ), both sides in the conflict negotiated to try to end the conflict. By December 15, 1897, the Treaty of Biak-na-Bato was signed between the Spanish colonial government and Aguinaldo. Under the Treaty, Aguinaldo and his cabinet agreed to go into exile upon being in demnified $400,000: $200,000 to the revolutionary army, and $200,000 more when the surrendered arms reached an agreed-upon to tal. An additional $900,000 would be used to compensate non-combatant Filipino families who had suffered losses during the fighting. Aguinaldo and several of his closest associates sailed for Hong Kong on December 27, 1897, where the in demnity was deposited in banks. According to some sources, the general’s in tent was to use the funds to purchase war materiel and continue the fight against Spain. But his detractors held that time and the odds favored the revolutionary for ces, creating considerable suspicion that the treaty was essentially a sell-out. Be that as it may, it was an illusory peace, as the Spanish barely complied with the treaty’s terms, nor did the revolutionary for ces lay down their arms. Besides, the revolution could no longer be bound by the policies of Aguinaldo and his Cabinet. The genie had been let out of the bottle. Now there was a near- universal desire to be rid of Spanish rule. The fighting continued in Central and Northern Luzon, and in parts of the Visayas. But events moved fast. On February 15, 1898, the USS Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana. In a feverish exercise of yellow journalism, the U. S. press stoked public outrage, and the United States used the Maine as a pretext to declare war on Spain in April. And so the stage was set for the rise of the United States as a global power and the beginning of what is of ten referred to as the American Century."

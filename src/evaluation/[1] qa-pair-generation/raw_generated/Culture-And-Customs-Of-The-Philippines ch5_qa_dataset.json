      "context": "Page 99 5 Cuisine and Fashion THE PHILIPPINES’ long colonial history under two Western nations, as well as frequent contact with many Asian neighbors, has made this island nation a unique case study of cultural adoption. Most properly said, Philippine culture is syncretic in that it adopts external in fluences and reshapes them to fit local conditions and preferences. This syncretic process is most clearly seen in the nation’s widely varied cuisine that combines in fluences from many other cultures and creates new dishes and tastes that are truly Filipino. The same is less true for fashion, since Filipinos are very conscious of contemporary in ternational fashion trends that many emulate. But even here, the choices of clothing styles are still culturally molded, and some traditional dress has been maintained, at least for special occasions, out of a sense of cultural pride and assertion. ENVIRONMENTAL FOUNDATIONS OF PHILIPPINE CUISINE What is in digenous about Philippine cuisine? This basic question is addressed first so the process of in tegrating later for eign cuisines can be appreciated. Of all the factors enabling or limiting a culture’s cuisine, the most basic is the physical environment. The Philippine’s location in tropical Southeast Asia ensures warm year­round temperatures and abundant rainfall, resulting in a near continuous growing season. While some areas of the country receive more rainfall than others, the monsoon rains of summer support an extensive rice culture; rice, then, is the foundation of the country’s cuisine. Rice is the most important part of every meal and serves as the bed upon which all other foods lie. In the Filipino diet, rice fulfills the role of the Page 100 necessary cereal of substance for the country’s farmers and manual laborers who demand lots of the grain at every meal and who equate cereal in take with good nutrition"

In the Filipino diet, rice fulfills the role of the Page 100 necessary cereal of substance for the country’s farmers and manual laborers who demand lots of the grain at every meal and who equate cereal in take with good nutrition. Rural and urban workers know about the nutritional value of other foods, but the lack of meat, vegetables, and fruit does not leave them feeling hungry nor would it limit their ability to work as does the absence of rice. Therefore, to the average Filipino, rice is the primary building block of nutritional health.1 Rice is also made into other foods such as porridge (goto) or a gruel that serves as a base for recipes like arroz caldo that contains chicken and is flavored with ginger. Rice is also ground into flour and made into the popular bihon noodle or baked into a wide variety of cakes, such as puto and many others, that are consumed at midday breaks and ceremonial occasions. As well, sticky, or glutinous, varieties of rice are the basis of a number of desserts, in cluding suman, which is wrapped in a tightly bound coconut leaf. Young rice is pounded into flat flakes to become pinipig and used as a dessert with coconut milk or as a to pping to chocolate.2 Rice can also be made into wine, but except for the mountain people of the central Cordillera, the culture of rice wine is not as strong in the Philippines as other Asian nations. Rice is not just the basic food of lunch and dinner but is an important part of breakfast. At daybreak, leftover rice from the evening meal is moistened, crumpled up, and heated in a skillet with cooking oil and two or three cloves of garlic plus salt and pepper. Sometimes on ions, and vegetables, such as peppers, or shreds of fried egg are added if available"

At daybreak, leftover rice from the evening meal is moistened, crumpled up, and heated in a skillet with cooking oil and two or three cloves of garlic plus salt and pepper. Sometimes on ions, and vegetables, such as peppers, or shreds of fried egg are added if available. Whether supplemented with extras or not, the fried rice accompanies a fried egg, sausage, salted anchovies, dried beef stick, or leftovers from the night before. Another clear in dication of the essential nature of rice comes from the culture’s linguistic base. The word for cooked rice is kanin and is the root of the whole nomenclature of eating: kain is to eat; pagkain is food; kumain is to take a meal; nagpapakain is to feed people; nakakain means that something is fit to consume; pang­kain is money set aside for food. In contrast, the word ulam, which is a generic term for victuals of meat, fish, or vegetables, has only that one application, and the word papak is to eat with out rice, meaning between meals. A second prominent geographic feature shaping the Philippine’s cuisine is the proximity to water. Composed of over 7,000 islands, much of the country’s population lives near saltwater oceans and seas. In addition, most islands are dissected by numerous rivers, and there are a few large lakes on Luzon and Mindanao islands that provide still more freshwater resources. Even the rice paddies are water reserves that have a dietary impact beyond the production of the rice grain. This relationship between people and water accounts for the primacy of fish in the diet of many Filipinos.

Most fishing is done at night with kerosene lanterns to at tract fish to the surface. Because the country’s in terior waters are relatively shallow, there are numerous coral reefs that support a large fish population. Filipinos, the refore, enjoy a wide variety of fish and shellfish. People on the island of Samar catch small and medium­size sharks to be eaten as pulutan (finger food consumed while drinking) or for a meal’s main course, although most Filipinos find shark a little too exotic for their taste. In some saltwater areas, where the water is particularly shallow and calm, and in freshwater, corrals are used to trap the fish. In rivers and streams, handheld bamboo traps are used to catch extra protein for the family’s evening meal. Rivers, lakes, and rice paddies contain frogs, crayfish, eels, snails, and clams. Fish and shrimp are also preserved as fish sauce (patis) and as fish or shrimp paste (bagoong) and used in many recipes and as a flavoring condiment that appears on many Filipino tables. Sometimes bagoong is mixed directly into rice for a poor man’s viand. Both patis and bagoong are also found in the cuisines of neighboring states of Southeast Asia under a variety of local names.3 Filipinos make extensive use of their land’s bounty to supplement their diet with a variety of root crops, in cluding sweet potatoes, taro roots, and yams, such as the purple­colored ube root. There are also a number of vegetables, tendrils, leaves, some flowers, and even common weeds, such as saluyot and the swamp growth kangkong, that makes for a robust greenery to add flavor and considerable nutritional value to a meal"

The Philippine climate produces an abundance of fruits that are eaten directly or, in the case of some sour fruits, used as a souring agent in dishes. The most versatile fruit may be the coconut, the sap of which is fermented into an alcoholic drink, the water in side the nut is drunk, while the flesh of the young coconut is eaten directly or cooked with meats. Meanwhile, the white meat of older coconuts is added directly to recipes, mixed with water and squeezed for coconut milk, or grated and used as a to pping on cakes and desserts. As well, there are a variety of local spices and a range of chilis and peppers.4 Finally, one cannot ignore the animals that are a part of the Filipino diet. The pig and chicken, especially losing fighting cocks, have long been staples just as have the water buffalo (carabao), ducks, deer, and wild boar. Though Westerners might be off­put, since Filipinos live close to their environment, they make use of virtually any and all animals that might be edible, in cluding field rats, dogs, in sects such as beetles and locusts, bats, snakes, woodworms, and even ant eggs. Page 102 COOKING STYLES AND REGIONAL VARIATIONS Methods of preparing Filipino cuisine are relatively simple and direct, and freshness is prized. Foods are either roasted, fried, steamed, or boiled/stewed soon after being obtained, since traditionally, there was no refrigeration, and food had to be prepared before spoilage in the tropical heat set in. As well, cooking methods had to act as a preservative in case the food could not be consumed immediately or if there was more than could be eaten in a single meal. This is accomplished by salting meat and fish or marinating food in vinegar and spices to be eaten raw"

This is accomplished by salting meat and fish or marinating food in vinegar and spices to be eaten raw. Two well­known Filipino dishes, adobo and sinigang, are prepared by stewing. Since the name of the for mer is similar to a dish in Mexico and a relish in Spain, some people assume this dish was imported. In fact, the first Spaniards noticed how similar this local dish was to their own and called it the adobo de los naturales, the adobo of the native peoples.5 The meat, which is usually either chicken or pork or a combination of the two, is stewed in vinegar and spices such as garlic and peppercorns. In the Philippines, there are a number of regional variations for adobo, for example, in Manila soy sauce is added, while the cooks of neighboring Cavite add mashed pork liver. Cooks of Laguna have a yellowish tinge to their adobo thanks to the addition of turmeric. In the far south of Muslim Zambonga, the local adobo is made especially rich and delicious with the addition of coconut cream to the sauce.6 As well known as adobo is to many for eign visitors and as widespread are its regional recipes, it is sinigang that is, perhaps, more representative of Philippine cuisine. Sinigang has been referred to as the “pride” of native cuisine and a genuine Filipino concoction.

What makes the recipe is its sour taste, which comes from the in clusion of acidic fruits such as tamarind, green mango, guava, or to matoes.7 Because a sour broth has the effect of cooling the body, this dish is especially welcome in tropical climates and the flexibility of in gredients make it a natural choice for busy housewives. Although a quick cooking method, roasting can be difficult since meat or fish becomes dry if over done, so Philippine roasting methods at tempt to retain natural juices as long as possible. This is certainly true for lechon (pig roasted on a spit), which is well timed so the frequently basted skin becomes a hard crunchy shell keeping the meat in side soft and juicy.8 Foods that are more difficult to monitor, such as fish, are first marinated to in crease their chances for emerging succulent from the roasting process. Banana leaves Page 103 are a frequently used cooking tool for steam cooking, since they can wrap and protect delicate foods so they will retain their full flavor and juices. Pinais, for example, is the term for fish or shrimp wrapped in banana leaves and steamed with on ions, to matoes, and young coconut. Fish that cannot be consumed immediately is salted to prevent spoilage. The lowly anchovy is salted and appears as a crunchy breakfast food that is consumed in a manner similar to bacon. Larger fish are split down the back, salted, and then sun dried.

Philippine cuisine also has a practice of using sauces (sawsawan) that in creases taste variety and allows the diner to adjust the flavor. In addition to patis and bagoong, use is made of almost any food, spice, or liquid that can enhance flavor. Filipinos have a wide array of sauce combinations that are either spread on food or used as a dip. A sauce can be as simple as vinegar and garlic or a more complex medley of lime (kalamansi) juice, soy sauce, patis, and garlic.

The poor soil and harsh climate along the northwestern coast of Luzon has made the Ilocanos a hardy and frugal people. Their environment has also affected their local cuisine, which is low in meat and high in vegetables and rice. Their best known dish, pinakbet, is a stewed combination of vegetables flavored with bagoong and a bitter melon called ampalaya.

Mean­ Page 104 while, the Bicol region of Luzon is well noted for the use of hot chilies, coconut milk, and pili nuts. Especially popular is their pinangat, a spicy dish of taro leaves stuffed with meat and hot chilies. The central Visayan Islands are known for raising kinilaw to an art by the use of marinades of palm­wine vinegar, lime juice, chilies, and coconut milk. The regional cuisine of Mindanao and its smaller neighboring islands shows the frequency of contact with Malaysia and Indonesia in its abundant use of coconut milk, chilies, pimento, lemongrass, and, especially, curry.

These merchants undoubtedly brought some food with them for the trip and when in the Philippines they probably had occasion to share a meal with their Filipino trading partners. These contacts took place over an extended period, but it is likely that the process of adopting elements of Chinese cuisine moved slowly until the establishment of the Spanish colonial presence in Manila. Previously, Filipino centers of power and commerce were numerous, small, and spread over an extensive geographic area so Chinese traders had no reason to linger in any one place. However, the Page 105 concentration of mercantile activity in Manila, where Chinese traders were allowed to establish a residential area, plus the promulgation of laws limiting travel around the country greatly facilitated the in tegration of the two cuisines. The process was further accelerated as Chinese merchants began to marry local women and make a permanent life in the Spanish colony. This process of cultural adoption and in digenization is clearly seen in the noodle dish pancit, which like the other noodles in Philippine cuisine, in cluding the rice noodle bihon, plus miki, miswa, and sotanghon, all came from China. Once the noodle dish came to the Philippines, it was subject to the process of local adoption. So, for example, in coastal communities, fish, shrimp, and even squid were added, while in in tensive rice­growing areas, crumbled rice cakes were in cluded, and in still other areas, local vegetables or sausages appeared in the recipe.

Additionally, these dishes could be adopted easily because climatic and soil conditions in southern China were not that different from those in the Philippines, so the basic in gredients or acceptable substitutes were at hand and affordable.11 Spanish recipes entered the local cuisine, too, but not to the same degree as Chinese dishes, since many of their in gredients, such as olives, cannot be grown in the Philippines and because of the greater use of meat, especially beef.

Other Iberian dishes that have entered the Filipino diet in clude meat balls, the sausage longaniza, the breakfast roll pan de sal (bread of salt), the popular dessert made of egg and condensed milk, leche flan, and the rich egg yoke candy yemas. Yet even these foods, while not reserved exclusively for upscale restaurants and fiestas, are, nevertheless, on the tables of upper­ and middle­class Filipinos and are rarely seen in the homes of the country’s lower classes and peasants as are foods that or iginated in China.12 Mexico had an impact on the Philippines that is not of ten recognized.

There were fewer in troductions of Mexican dishes, but the dish menudo and mole sauce can be found in the Philippines along with local tamales that are considered a snack food rather than a real meal. Most Mexican foods are used as flavoring supplements to pre­existing recipes or, in the case of the fruits, simply added to the Filipino table and have been completely in corporated into the cuisine. Still, tamales are another case in point, illustrating how a for eign dish becomes in digenized. Now tamales are no longer wrapped in cornhusks but in banana leaves and its spicy flavor has become so sweet that in some areas of the country it is a dessert.13 When it came to food, the American turn­of­the­century imperial thrust took on the reform ethic of the Progressive era and sought to change Filipino ways of doing things. The new conquerors were appalled when they saw the “dirty” Filipino kitchens, and through their new educational system, they sought to uplift the island’s cuisine. In the Philippine Normal School, new courses in “domestic science” taught dish washing, care of kitchen utensils; nutrition; ways of cooking new recipes, such as cakes, fricassee, and sandwiches; menu planning; and food costs. The graduates were then sent out to transform society. These efforts were supported by articles in magazines such as the Ladies’ Home Journal and Good Housekeeping, showing elite Philippine households what was “modern” and sophisticated. The buzz words of the day were scientific and sanitary. Over time, some technological changes began to make over the Filipino kitchen, as gas and electric stoves, refrigerators, various food processing machines, and, more recently, microwave ovens and rice cookers have streamlined the task of food preparation"

The actual food preparation begins days in advance and in volves the voluntary labor of a host of relatives and household helpers who bring generations of skill and recipes to the collective task. The backyard is filled with preparation tables and cooking fires over which large vats of food are cooked and animals roasted. The centerpiece of a proper fiesta table is a roasted pig (lechon) surrounded by such Spanish dishes as the meat rolls embutido and marcon and rellenong manok, a deboned and rolled chicken stuffed with pork sausage and egg. Also on the table are richly enhanced versions of the Chinese foods pancit and lumpia and perhaps one or two in digenous dishes such as adobo and karikari, a beef dish using a rich sauce thickened by ground peanuts and rice. Beside the main table is another for the desserts, which shows an even greater Spanish in fluence, since desserts do not play a significant role in either Chinese or in digenous Philippine cuisine.

Guests are treated to levels of hospitality and positioning at the table depending on social rank with priests and government of ficials given priority and then other people of status and family rank. The host must repeatedly urge guests to eat, since it is seen as bad manners to appear to accept the in vitation too readily. The host cannot spend a great deal of time with each guest but usually devotes most of his at tention to guests of greatest status. At the end of a visit, the departing guest is given a small package of food, a pabaon, to take home as a reminder of the feast or as a gift to someone unable to at tend the fiesta meal.16 The fiesta table and hospitality of less prosperous town residents mirrors that of the wealthy host with some significant adjustments.

The meal is eaten after midnight mass (absolutely never before), and it is a time when Filipinos are only with those close to them. Generally, a meat or fish dish is eaten with rice, but the predominant tendency of this meal is to ward lighter foods, such as pancit, roasted chicken, and rice cakes such as puto. As well, there may be delicacies like ham slices, cheeses, American­style sandwiches, and sweet desserts made of glutinous or sticky rice. The social significance of this meal is its communion of close family loved ones through the sharing of food immediately after at tending the special midnight mass celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. SOCIAL­ECONOMIC CHANGE AND CUISINE One change that has directly affected contemporary Philippine cuisine is the development of hybrid rice strains by the International Rice Research Institute in Los Banos, Laguna. These high­yield varieties have doubled harvests and have the reby improved the supply of this important staple, helped Page 109 maintain nutritional standards, and lessened the extent to which valuable for eign exchange is spent on imported rice. On the other hand, the in creased use of fertilizers and in secticides necessary to get the seed’s full potential has killed off many fish, frogs, and other edible creatures that lived in the rice paddies. The farmer has, the refore, lost a free source of protein. As well, since modern agricultural chemicals are costly, the price of rice has risen sharply. Finally, with the downturn of the Philippine economy as part of the 1997 Asian economic crisis, food costs have become an even greater part of the average family’s budget. As a result of these developments, many families are making greater use of food extenders such as patis, bagoong, chilies, and soy sauce"

A few drinks define the Philippine drinking tradition. The basic fermented drink is tuba, which is obtained from the nipa palm and the coconut. The juices from these sources can be drunk fresh but are of ten allowed to ferment. Tuba is itself a popular drink, but it is also the basis for stronger drinks. In coconut­growing regions, tuba is distilled through a boiling process, and the steam’s condensation is collected and becomes lambanog, which eventually has a potency of 80 proof and easily ignites when to uched by a match. A similar distillation process for nipa tuba produces a drink called laksoy, which is then aged and tempered by the addition of fruits. Ilocano speakers are known for the sugar cane alcohol drink basi, which is made by boiling the cane juice and fermenting it in a jar after adding yeast, leaves, and bark. A good basi is thus aged anywhere from two to ten years, depending on the quality desired and the patience of the brewer.21 In addition to homemade brews, the Philippines is also home of San Miguel beer, which is well known throughout Asia. There are other smaller beer manufacturers, but the or iginal nineteenth century German beer manufacturing process has kept the Filipino loyal to the San Miguel brand name"

San Miguel also makes gin that, along with rum, are the drinks of the urban Page 112 poor, who do not have access to provincial home brews and who cannot afford beer. As with food, there is a culture surrounding the act of drinking. Filipinos are extremely social, and this characteristic extends to sharing drink and pulutan (finger food). The purpose of drinking is to socialize. While there is always plenty of drinking, Filipinos do not respect the drunkard, since that person has lost control of him or herself. The objective of drinking is to consume alcohol to feel good and enjoy each other’s company. Simply getting drunk is considered boorish and in dicative of a flawed character. Furthermore, there are communal customs that must be adhered to when drinking. So, for example, when drinking lambanog, the host customarily throws the first shot on the ground and drinks the next. He then refills the shot glass for the next drinker. Only one glass is used, and each person must empty the glass before the next person can drink. In many areas, there is no discrimination against women who drink especially with other women, although mixed company drinking is not considered unusual. It is always an in sult to refuse a drink, although one is not obliged to remain with a drinking group for a long period if there are competing demands. In most drinking sessions, pulutan is consumed and may consist of anything from peanuts and eggs to meat and fish but usually not fruit or vegetables.

In the twentieth century, this trend continued and the in fluence of modern in ternational fashion has greatly affected the traditional for mal Philippine woman’s dress, called the terno. In something of a contrast, the barong tagalog, a loose­fitting shirt of sheer cloth that is frequently adorned with varying amounts of embroidery, continues to enjoy popularity and has kept a place for itself in the man’s wardrobe thanks to the creative adaptation of the shirt’s style to contemporary lifestyle demands.

The cloth is of ten decorated with in tricate embroidery but can also be adorned with hand­painted flowers or other embellishments that in clude pearls, teardrops, beads, sequins, and rhinestones. Most characteristic of all, is the terno’s dramatic “but terfly” sleeves that clearly differentiate it from Western evening wear. Though unique to the Philippines, the present dress is markedly different from its much more elaborate predecessors. The contemporary terno evolved from a much older union of the European­style skirt, the saya, that was combined with a pre­Hispanic sarongstyle dress, the tapis, which was used as an overlapping at tachment similar to an apron. It should be noted that upper­class mestizo women of Spanish and Filipino parentage would of ten shun the tapis because of its visual association with a work apron. Meanwhile, the upper body was covered by a blouse (camisa or baro) that was to pped with an embroidered kerchieflike drape (the panuelo) that was worn around the bodice to preserve a woman’s modesty. This Spanish­era fashion development culminated with the Maria Clara dress, named after the hapless heroine of Jose Rizal’s novel, Noli Me Tangere (1887). This dress combined the camisa and panuelo with a unique saya of numerous vertical panels of heavy satin in contrasting colors. The gown of the mestiza quickly evolved into the terno during the American period, as the camisa and the saya became matched in material and color, and the tapis was replaced by a smaller, sheer embroidered wraparound piece called the sobrefalda"

During her lengthy term as first lady, Imelda Marcos championed the terno and supported the work of many designers and craftsmen. Because of her efforts, the terno gained an in ternational stature, but it also became so closely associated Page 115 with the first lady that a reaction against the dress set in immediately after the Marcos couple fled the country in 1986. Only gradually has the dress regained its stature as harsh feelings against the Marcos regime have moderated. The Barong Tagalog Just as women quickly adopted Western dress styles, Filipino men switched from loincloths to loose­fitting trousers. The Muslim men of the southern islands adopted tight­fitting breeches and open jackets with tight fitting sleeves and in tegrated them into their customary fashion along with a kerchief. By the mid­eighteenth century, Christian Filipinos had taken to trousers that reached slightly below the knee and wore loose shirts of short sleeves called the baro, which over time became decorated with embroidery. Other than the native hat, the salakot, there were very few other clothing items, and male clothing styles did not change markedly for a long period. By the early nineteenth century, however, upper­class Filipinos began a wholesale adoption of the Spanish style of dress, which even in cluded walking canes, as a way of in tegrating the mselves into the colonial power structure. In the face of this native imitation, a regulation was passed in the 1830 s requiring natives to wear their shirts outside of their trousers—the practice of tucking in one’s shirt was a privileged manner of dress reserved for Spaniards. This discriminatory dress code soon made the lowly baro a symbol of nationalism"

This discriminatory dress code soon made the lowly baro a symbol of nationalism. Faced with colonial snobbery and derision, the nationalist sought to embrace what his oppressor rejected. It was not long before the baro became to day’s barong tagalog, the physical embodiment of things Filipino and of national pride. In its process of transformation, the baro gained a collar and was made in long and short­sleeve versions. The for merly plain shirt also became colorful with differently dyed cloth, design patterns, and elaborate embroidery. No matter what the color, decoration, or peculiar cut of the in dividual shirt, the baro was always made of a sheer native cloth, which made them especially well adapted to the country’s tropical climate—certainly more so than the heavy layering of thick fabric required of dressing in a European fashion.24 Quite ironically, the barong tagalog virtually disappeared during the revolt against Spain and during the entire American colonial era. It could only be imagined that the stigma of in feriority at tached to the barong was so strong that the shirt was shed immediately as young revolutionaries sought to establish an in dependent nation, and during the relatively benign American period there was a desire to emulate the “modern” ways that the coat and tie Page 116 represented.

Quezon wore a specially designed barong with embroidered American and Philippine flags, did the shirt enjoy a brief flicker of popularity"

Quezon wore a specially designed barong with embroidered American and Philippine flags, did the shirt enjoy a brief flicker of popularity. It was not until the post–World War II era that the barong tagalog truly came into its own, thanks in no small part to the movie in dustry that sought to contribute to the development of values fitting the newly in dependent nation. The barong tagalog was chosen as the visual representation of humility and in tegrity. The hero always appeared in a barong, while the city­slicker villains were impeccably dressed in Western cloths. The popular 1950 s movie star Leopoldo Salcedo, pioneered a Valentino­style of barong tagalog, and soon the shirt became fashionable again. The reputation and status of the shirt was affirmed as all Philippine presidents wore the shirt on state occasions and as designers for Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior used the barong and redesigned it for high culture fashions.25 With the addition of pockets at waist level and short sleeves, the polo barong became an acceptable work shirt for of fice workers and managers thus assuring its in clusion in a typical male wardrobe even as the women’s terno became limited to for mal occasions only. In fact, elements of the barong’s cut and its typical embroidery patterns have appeared on more casual women’s dresses. Minority peoples had their own traditional woven cloths for men and women. These cloths ranged in quality and artistic sophistication from hill dwelling Aetas, who remained clad in little more than loincloths until recent times, to the Mandaya and other ethnic groups on Mindanao island, whose dress is colorful and elaborate. Even these latter folks have, for the most part, adopted Western clothes for everyday use and only retain their traditional costumes for ceremonial occasions"

Most lowland Christian Filipinos wear Western clothes for most daily activities and for casual wear as they have since the American period when all the latest fashions for both men and women made their appearance in the country. Nevertheless, there are preferences for Western clothes that allow for the greatest comfort in tropical climates as witnessed by the popularity of the men’s “shirtjak,” a short­sleeve shirt cut square at the midriff, which popular in the 1960 s and 1970 s because it was not tucked into the pants, and its loose fit allowed for maximum air circulation. That Philippine culture has in digenized a variety of for eign culinary in fluences on the one hand but largely in corporated Western clothing styles is a provocative study in contrasts. The explanation may lie in the environmental and climatic basis for Philippine cuisine which lends resilience to adapting foods to native taste. However, specific clothing styles are not as fundamental to daily existence as is food nor were pre­Hispanic forms of dress as fit for the needs of the modern world as were the clothes in troduced by Westerners. Page 117 Only the barong tagalog has made the transition to contemporary use thanks to selective adoption, bolstered by pride in the shirt as a national costume. NOTES 1.

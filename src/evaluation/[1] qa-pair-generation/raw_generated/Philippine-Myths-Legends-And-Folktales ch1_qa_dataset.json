      "context": "How People Were Created ALONG TIME AGO, according to the Bagobos of Southern Mindanao, there was not a single man or woman in the | whole wide world. There lived only Tuglay and Tuglibon, the two mighty beings who had created the world. One day Tuglay spoke to Tuglibon and said: “Wife, perhaps it would be better if there were people in the world.” “It would be far better in deed,” replied Tuglibon. “There should be people who will enjoy the beautiful new world we have made. Let us create a man and a woman who will love the blue sky and the wide sea. Let us create people who will love the flowers in the valleys and the clouds on the mountains.” So Tuglay took some corn meal in his hands, mois- tened it, and shaped it into human figures. Then he covered the figures with scales and gave them life. | When the creatures stood up, however, they looked very wooden, for Tuglay had for gotten to make joints in their bones. Their arms and legs were very stiff and they of ten stumbled to the ground when they walked., More- over, their eyes were very small, their ears were half hidden, and their noses could hardly be seen. But worst of all, they could not hold anything with their stiff fingers, and because their bodies were covered with scales, they looked more like reptiles than human beings. 3 “I am not pleased with the people you made,” said Tuglibon. “Better try again.” But Tuglay felt satisfied with them. “I think they will do,” he said., The more Tuglibon looked at them, however, the more she disliked them. “How will the world look when it’s full of these ugly creatures?” she said. “I want people who can move about gracefully and who are not covered with scales as if they were serpents.”, “These two are good enough for me,” Tuglay replied coldly. “I will not change them.” Tuglibon spoke no more about the matter, but she felt very uneasy thinking of the ill-shaped creatures"

At last, when she could think of no better thing to do, she threw a handful of corn meal into her husband’s eyes. “Now he will not see me work,” she told herself. Quickly she moistened the rest of the corn meal and shaped it into human figures. She made joints in their bones. She gave them bright eyes for seeing, well-shaped ears for hearing, larger noses for smelling, and pretty mouths for eating and speaking. She gave them smooth skins for feeling, putting scales only at the tips of their toes and fingers. Finally, after she had given them each a big heart for loving, she put life into them. Then she made them stand up, and they were beautiful to look at. When her work was finished, Tuglibon washed the corn meal out of Tuglay’s eyes. Tuglay was very angry for what she had done to him, but upon seeing the man and woman, he was convinced that they were in deed better- looking than those he had made. “I am glad you made them,” he said. “They and their children will be the rulers of the world.” “They will love only the beautiful and shun the ugly,” Tuglibon said. “They will enjoy the songs of the birds, and they will wash their bodies in the cool springs and rivers. They will love each other, and watching the sun by day and the moon and stars by night, they will love us who created them.” So saying, Tuglay and Tuglibon smiled at the first man and woman who became the ancestors of the people now living on earth.

As for the scaly creatures that Tuglay made, nothing more was heard of them. Why the Sun Is Brighter than the Moon BATHALA, the creator of the world, had a son named Apolaki and a daughter named Mayari. The light that shone upon the world and enabled the people, the beasts, the birds, and the fish to see came from the bright eyes of Apolaki and Mayari. So all the creatures loved them dearly. Bathala himself was very fond of his children, and he watched over them as they wandered across the meadows of heaven. Since the eyes of Apolaki and Mayari shone continuously, it was always day on the earth. In time Bathala grew feeble with age and died. Then Apolaki and Mayari had a quarrel, for each wanted to rule the world alone. “I am the man and I will succeed my father to the throne,” said Apolaki. “I am going to rule the world, whether you like it or not.” Mayari’s eyes flashed with anger and she said, “I am no less my father’s child than you. I will succeed him to his throne, whether you like it or not!” The quarrel grew from bad to worse, and finally words could not express their furious rage. So they picked up wooden clubs and fell upon each other with fierce blows. Back and forth they fought until at last Apolaki struck Mayari in the face and she became blind in one eye. When he saw his sister stricken, Apolaki took pity on her and said, “Let us fight no more, my sister. Let us 6 share our father’s kingdom equally between us. Let us reign by turns and be friends.” Mayari agreed, and from then on, Apolaki, whom we know to day as the Sun, has ruled the world half the time. Mayari, whom we now know as the Moon, has taken turns with her brother in ruling the world"

NG & wi Hii y /; he 4 s vad The Coleto and the Crow IF YOU WANT TO KNOW why the crow is black and why the coleto has no feathers on top of his head, this Tagalog legend will tell you: Once upon a time the crow was a white bird. The coleto, a bird as small as a maya, was as black as he is to day, but he was not bald-headed then. There was a thick crest of feathers on top of his head. One cool day the crow was up in a tree practicing his voice. “Wak! Wak! Wak!” he said. Along came the coleto and said in his musical voice: “What a sweet song you have! I wish I were deaf. Then I would not hear your voice.” This remark annoyed the crow, for he knew that his voice was unpleasant and that he needed much singing practice. “If my voice is not sweet,” said he, “neither am I as tiny as you are.” “It’s true that Iam tiny!” said the coleto, suddenly getting angry because he was very sensitive about his size. “Yet I can fly much higher than any other bird in the whole world. I can outfly the eagle himself.” “You must be mad to say that,” said the crow. “How can you race the king of the birds? You cannot even race me ” The coleto laughed scornfully. “Would you like to have a test of wings with me?” said he. “Would you like to fly a race?” “Better go home, Son,” replied the crow. “Go home and eat more rice, drink more water, and breathe in more air"

Wait till your wings are wider before you challenge me to a flying race.” “You for get that the smallest pepper is the hottest,” said the coleto. “In the same way, a person’s ability cannot be told by his size. You are no doubt bigger than I, but you are heavier and slower, too.” “If you want to fly a race, then let’s fly a race and stop this talk,” said the crow crossly. “Would you like the race to begin now?” 10 “Yes!” The coleto counted three, and the race was on. Up and up, up and up they flew side by side, racing each other until they came to a dark cloud and lost sight of each other. So they flew on separately. At last the coleto had flown so. high that he knocked his head against the floor of the sky, and the skin on top of his head was scraped off. On the other hand, the crow flew so near the sun that his white feathers were burned. They were both very much frightened by the experi- ence, and when they returned to earth they for got all about the race.

But once, in the olden days, there appeared a frightful dragon on the highest mountain in the island. The monster had seven ugly heads, and its dark green body was a full kilometer long.

The monster had seven ugly heads, and its dark green body was a full kilometer long. It snorted out hot smoke from its fourteen nostrils. From its seven cavernous mouths it belched to rrents of death-dealing fire. The smoke from its nostrils and the fire from its mouths ruined the crops in the fields, burned down whole to wns, and killed hundreds of men, women, and children. So the people were in constant dread of the dragon. They sought all sorts of ways to appease it, but its wrath did not abate. At last it was found that if a beautiful maiden was of fered to the dragon, it would not molest the people for a whole year. So at the beginning of each year the priests chose the fairest maiden in the kingdom. They dressed her in a black robe and took her to the slopes of the moun- tain. There a religious ceremony followed and then she was left alone on the mountain. She was never heard of again, but the people knew that the dragon had devoured her, and for twelve moons no fire or smoke would de- scend upon the valleys. This went on year after year. But soon no maiden 12 could be found beautiful enough to be acceptable to the dragon. Every father had learned to make ugly marks on the face of his daughter when she was still a baby. In this way he would not run the risk of losing her when she grew up into a young woman. At last only the king’s daughter remained. She was beautiful beyond words. No one had had the heart to mutilate her lovely face. All felt sure she would become queen after her father’s death, and of course the people knew that to be ruled by a queen with an ugly face would be hard in deed. The priests sought everywhere for another maiden whom the dragon might accept as a sacrifice, but all the virgins they found had ugly faces. “What shall we do?” the king asked, raising his hands in despair"

Ominous bursts of smoke and fierce to ngues of flame had begun to appear at the top of the dragon’s mountain. “Indeed, what shall we do?” asked the people. Nothing else could be done, so it was at last decided to sacrifice the king’s daughter rather than feel the dragon’s wrath again. Just then there appeared in the kingdom a handsome young stranger at tired in the robes of a great prince from 13, ——e a ~ “AE India. He walked to the palace, stood before the king, and said: “T heard about your troubles and have come to see what I can do to help.” “Thank you in deed,” said the king. “Slay the dragon or even just drive it away and you shall be rewarded with all the gold you can carry, and my daughter shall be yours.” The stranger left with out another word. He climbed up the slopes of the mountain and saw ants crawling on the ground, bees sipping nectar from the flowers, and eagles soaring among the clouds high up overhead. Now the stranger was really the great god Laon. He was skilled in talking with the birds, the beasts, and the in sects in their own language. He now spoke to one of the ants and said: “Tam your Lord Laon. Hurry to your king and tell him it is my command that he march with all his warriors to the top of this mountain. He must help fight the dragon.” “Yes, Khan Laon,” replied the ant and scurried off with a courteous bow. Likewise the great god Laon spoke to one of the bees 14 and said: “I am your Lord Laon.

There he saw the dragon’s immense body sprawled over the rocks and crags. With its fierce green eyes the monster saw him and began snorting out hot smoke from its fourteen nostrils and belching deadly fire from its seven mouths. Then the people in the valleys grew alarmed and began to blame the king. “The stranger has aroused the dragon’s wrath!” said they. “Why did our king allow him to wake up the sleeping monster?” The king himself sat worried on his throne. And the princess, who had seen the stranger when he first arrived and had fallen in love with him, fretted in her chamber. “He will get killed, he will get killed!” she moaned to herself.

At the same time its fearful claws stabbed the air and its vast body coiled and uncoiled on the rocks and boulders.

The dragon threw out clouds of stifling smoke and floods of fire. It slashed the air blindly with its terrible claws. But the great god chopped off its heads one by one.

The dog was old and had lost all his teeth, but he knew all the paths in the town. The cat was still young, but she could not run long errands because she did not know the way. She was afraid to wander far from her master’s house. One day the man said to his pets, “You two, go to the next town and give this ring to my daughter. You cat,” he added, “because you are very careful about things you carry, I shall let you hold the ring. And you dog, show the cat which way to go, and do not let anyone steal the ring.” The cat and the dog promised to do as they were told, and they set out on their journey. Now a swift river lay in their path. There was no bridge across the river and so they tried to look for a boat. They found no boat, however, but they did not give up their journey, for in those days cats loved to swim as much as dogs and people did, although to be sure cats could not swim so well. Now the dog became worried about the ring. As they were about to cross the river, he turned to the cat and said, “Let me hold the ring while we are in the water. Iam afraid you will drop the ring.” “No, no!” replied the cat. “Our master told me to hold the ring. I will not give you the ring.” 17 “Better give it to me,” the dog in sisted. “I am sure I can hold it better than you.” “T will not give you the ring!” repeated the cat, her eyes glowing with wrath. The dog grew angry, too, and said, “Will you give me the ring or not?” He approached the cat and prepared to take the ring by force. The cat was frightened and gave the ring to him. “If you lose it, 1 am not to blame,” she said. Then they started to swim across. The river was so swift that they soon grew tired.

So he called all the other dogs in the town and told them to hunt for the culprit. “Bring him back and I will give you much gold,” said he.

Meanwhile, the cat was so frightened by her experi- ence in the water that she has never dared swim again. 20 The Origin of Bananas WOULD YOU LIKE to know how bananas came into the world? Then stop pulling one another’s hair and I shall tell you. Once, in Lanao, there was a kingdom of green fields, clear streams, and blue hills. A princess ruled the beauti- ful kingdom, and she was so kind, so beautiful, and so wise that her subjects did everything they could to make her happy. “Let us raise enough food in our fields,” said the men. “Then our queen will be happy.” “Let us keep our to wns clean and our homes neat,” said the women. “Then our queen will feel proud of us all.” “Let us be obedient and good,” said the children. “Then the queen and our parents will always love us.” And you may not believe it but what they promised to do they did. The men burned down the cockpits and gambling houses and worked on their farms all day"

The men burned down the cockpits and gambling houses and worked on their farms all day. The women kept their homes as clean and shiny as your uncle’s bald head. And the children became so good that their parents threw away their whips and their teachers thought less of how to make them learn their lessons and more of what lessons to teach them. But one person in the kingdom was not at all happy. She was a wicked cousin of the queen’s. She wanted to rule in place of the queen and thought of ways to rob the queen of her throne. The years went by and the queen ruled alone. From many for eign lands kings and princes came begging her for her love. But the queen said: “If I take one of you the others will be angry. Then there will be war. I would rather remain single and have peace in my kingdom than take a husband and cause trouble.” Now the wicked cousin of the queen’s secretly loved one of the suitors. She thought of a plan and took this suitor aside. Then she whispered in his ear: “Why do you waste time? My cousin the queen loves you. But she cannot accept your love because she is afraid that if she does, the other suitors will make war on her kingdom. Bring your army here, the refore, and slay your rivals and the queen’s guards. Then enter the city, and the queen and her kingdom will be yours.” _The suitor believed her and left for his native land. Then he gathered his able st soldiers and hurried back to the queen’s realm. In the meantime, a brightly colored magic bird, the Nori, had heard the wicked woman plotting with the P 22 suitor. The Nori flew to the queen’s window, fluttered its wings, and said, “Listen, O queen! I wish to speak with you.” “Speak on,” replied the queen. “Know that one of your suitors plans to kill his rivals and your guards"

But that is not the end of the matter. Your cousin wants your crown and will not rest until she has slain you and won your husband’s love.”. Having spoken, the magic bird flew away, and the queen was greatly troubled. “Alas,” she sighed, “I have tried to rule my kingdom wisely and well. I have tried to please my people the best way Ican. But my own cousin wants to betray me!” Her heart was heavy with sorrow. She wept bitterly as though her heart would break, but she showed her grief to no one. When night came she asked everyone in the palace— the servants, the courtiers, and the guards—to go outside the palace walls. The people wondered why the queen made such a strange request, but they thought she must have good reasons because she had never done anything unwise before. _ When they were gone, the queen locked up herself in her chamber and set the room on fire. The fire quickly spread into the other rooms. The people saw the flames and tried to rush in to put out the fire. But the queen had locked the palace gates, too, and with the entire palace she perished in the flames. The people mourned deeply over the death of their queen and built a beautiful fence around her ashes. “We must honor her who loved us so well,” they said. One morning, not long after, a strange plant appeared on the pile of ashes. It had long, wide leaves and a straight white trunk. There were no thorns on the trunk of the tree, and it fluttered its leaves gracefully in the wind. The plant came to be known as the banana. “It is our _ queen,” said the people to one another"

Slender fruit came from the flower. The fruit ripened, and the people, tasting it, said: “It is delicious! It is our queen’s gift to us!” So they ate the fruit, and all agreed that their queen’s gift was as sweet as she had always been. As for the queen’s wicked cousin, God turned her into a monkey. She found the queen’s gift very delicious and she has liked the banana more than any other fruit."

      "context": "Death and Datu Omar THERE ONCE LIVED, upon a time, a poor man named Omar. He was a rich man’s servant, but no matter how hard he worked and how honestly he served, he remained poor. At last he felt discouraged and decided that to die would be better than to go on living. Since the laws of his people, the Maranaos, did not allow a man to kill himself, he walked to the house of the village chief, stood before the men gathered there, and said: “I want to die rather than go on living. Let one of you draw his kris and slay me.” The chief and his men heard him and replied, “The laws of our land for bid a man to kill his neighbor. If you want to die, the river is brown with crocodiles, and they are hun- gry.” Omar walked to the river and found scores of crocodiles sunning the mselves in the water and waiting for prey to come along. He went to the place where they lay thickest, leaped into the water with a big splash, and waited to be devoured. — But the beasts kept still, and not one of them moved to eat him. Omar waited impatiently and then swam to the largest of the crocodiles. But they all fled when he came near, and they hid in their caves, leaving him alone in the water. 96 Omar returned to the village and told the men what happened. “Show me how I might kill myself,” he pleaded. “A furious typhoon is coming,” said the men. “It will uproot many trees. Go to the for est and you will be crushed to death.” Omar hurried to the woods and stood under a dead tree which he knew would fall at the first gust of wind. Soon the typhoon descended and knocked down all the trees about him. But his tree remained standing. He saw a big tree about to crash to the ground, and he ran and stood under it. As soon as he got there the tree he had just left fell with a loud crash, but the tree over his head stopped in its fall and remained leaning halfway to the ground"

As soon as he got there the tree he had just left fell with a loud crash, but the tree over his head stopped in its fall and remained leaning halfway to the ground. Soon the typhoon blew over, and in desperation Omar ran about, knocking his head against the fallen trees, trying to kill himself. At last, cold and exhausted but still alive, he fell to the ground and fainted. Then to him there appeared a stranger in yellow robes who said, “What made you lie down here, Omar? It is wet and cold.” “I have come here seeking death,” replied Omar. “For to me death would be much sweeter than life.” “It’s not your time to die,” said the stranger. “You are young and strong. Rise, pick up your to ols, and be a tiller 97 of the soil. When it is your time, death will come for you. Rise, and live on.” So saying, the stranger walked off and then Omar awoke. To his surprise, when he opened his eyes he found at his side a plow and other farm to ols, none of which had been there before. He picked them up, walked back to the village, and became a farmer. It did not take long before he grew wealthy. He became the datu of the village, owned much land, and had a large and happy family. No one in that community had more in- fluence than Datu Omar, and none had more honor than he. One night; years later, while Datu Omar lay asleep in his room, there appeared an old man who beckoned to him and said: “Omar, your hour has come.” “My hour?” said Datu Omar. “I do not know of what you speak.” “Your hour has come,” repeated the stranger. “Rise and come with me.” Datu Omar jumped out of bed, pointed to the door, and shouted, “Leave this house! I do not know you!” “Omar, arise and come with me,” repeated the stranger firmly. “The hour of your death has come.” “Leave!” yelled Datu Omar"

Please let me live just a month longer.” The stranger granted his request and left. “I shall come for you when the month is over,” said he. The following morning Datu Omar gathered his tenants to gether and or dered them to erect a high to wer. The men labored in much hurry, and before the month was out, the to wer stood high up above the coconut trees. “Let Malakal- maut come,” he said. “He cannot climb up so high.” But when the month ended, while Datu Omar lay asleep in his room at the top of the to wer, he was awakened 98 by a voice in the middle of the night. He opened his eyes and saw Malakalmaut standing over him. “Your month is up,” said Death. But still Datu Omar did not want to go with Malakal- maut. First by means of threats and then by pleading, he tried to send Death away, but Death did not heed him. Finally Datu Omar begged, “Give me another week. I am not yet ready to leave this pleasant world of men.” Death granted him his second request, and Datu Omar spent the week putting up bars in the windows of his to wer. When the week was about to end, he double-barred the doors, fastened the windows, posted heavy guards at the gate, and said: “Death cannot enter now.” But promptly at midnight, when the week was over, Death appeared in his room and said, “Your time is up, Omar. Come with me.” In terror Datu Omar jumped out of bed, bolted out of the room, and fled from the to wer"

I know a cave where he will never find me.” He ran into the for est, taking devious ways, concealing himself behind rocks and trees. But when he entered the cave, there stood Malakalmaut waiting for him. So Datu Omar fled again, but every time he stopped and felt that he had finally shaken off Death, there Death stood, sternly facing him. He ran to this place and to that, like a man who had lost his mind, until he met a woman wearing white mourning clothes. “Whom do you mourn, my friend?” asked Datu Omar, for he recognized her as his neighbor. “I mourn the chief of my village,” she replied. “Datu Omar was such a good neighbor!” Hearing this, Datu Omar became more alarmed than ever and ran on. Soon he met a woman carrying a jar of water. “Iam very tired and thirsty,” said he, begging her for a drink. | “You may have a little of this water,” she said. “I need it to wash a dead man’s body.” 99 “Tell me who is dead,” he said, for he recognized her, too, as a woman of his village. “You have not heard of Datu Omar's death?” asked she “Datu Omar was a good man,” This frightened Datu Omar still more, and he ran again trying to flee from Death. Before long he came to some men digging in the ground. “Why do you men dig in such a hurry?” he asked them. “Indeed, why do we dig his grave?” the men asked the mselves. “Why do we bury our chief, who was such a good man?” Then the men started to weep, At this Datu Omar ran again, and soon he came upon some carpenters making a long wooden box"

He had four rice granaries but he was not content to stay at home looking after his property. He loved nothing so much as a good hunt, so one day before sunrise he took two of his best hunting dogs and headed for the for est to hunt. From early morning till the leaves of the for est were wet with dew he hunted, but he did not have much luck that day. Night fell before he knew it and he found that he had lost his way deep in the woods. So he called for his dogs. The dogs did not come, however, and since there was no one to guide him home, he sat down under a tree, built a fire, cooked supper, and ate. One of the dogs arrived after a while and sat by the fire. “Wait till I finish supper and then you will lead me home,” said Bang-gilit to the dog as if it could understand human speech. After he finished his supper he held his dog in leash and let it trot ahead of him. By and by the dog perked up its ears and yapped several times. His other dog answered with another yap- ping from the distance, and the first dog led Bang-gilit to where the second had barked, but they did not find the other dog. 101 They walked on and on until they reached the edge of the for est and came to a strange, brightly lighted town"

There Bang-gilit’s second dog sat waiting for them. “I wonder what town this is?” thought Bang-gilit. “I do not remember ever having been here before, and I have been to many places.” Many people were about, walking or talking among the mselves, and Bang-gilit stood looking on with his dogs. The streets v-ere wide and brightly lighted and the houses were large and airy. Some veople gathered around Bang-gilit and said to one another: “Perhaps this man has just arrived in our town. We have never seen him before.” Then they turned to him and said: “Where were you hit? Who speared you?” “I was not speared at all,” said Bang-gilit, shaking his head. “Iam a peaceful man and have never been in battle.” “How did you meet your death then?” they asked. “T did not die,” replied Bang-gilit. “Iam a peaceful citizen from the land of the Ifugaos, and my name is Bang- gilit.” “Then why are you in this town?” they asked. “Only the dead come here.” “IT was hunting in the woods and night fell before I could find my way home,” he explained. “My dogs were missing and I cooked supper and ate. One of my dogs returned while I was eating. I fed it and then took it in leash and we followed a footpath. By and by my other dog barked in the distance. We went after it but did not find it till we arrived here. The dog sat waiting for us at the edge of your town.” “But, man, only the souls of the dead reach this town,” said they. “This is the Sky-World.

I should like to return to my people after four days.” “Do you mean four Sky-World days or four Earth- World days?” they asked. Bang-gilit was puzzled at this question and asked what they meant. “Are there two kinds of days?” he asked. “You see,” they explained, “a day in the Sky-World is as long as a year in the Earth-World. Four Sky-World days would be quite a long time to people in the Earth-World.” “Tt is hard to believe what you say,” said Bang-gilit, shaking his head and smiling in disbelief. “But however it may be, I will stay here only four days.” “You will find out what we mean when you go back to your people,” said they. Bang-gilit remained four days in the Sky-World. He visited other to wns there and found them all quiet and clean and peaceful.

With his dogs he slid down the tree, reached the ground, and heard the cocks crowing and saw the village folk just waking up from sleep.

Their farm was so small and the soil so poor that the beans, to matoes, and eggplants they raised were barely enough for their daily needs. To make it worse for them, one day the husband be- came ill. So the wife had to do the work all by herself. She would leave the house early after breakfast and be out working in the field all day. She was weeding the plants one morning when she found a copper coin in the grass. She weeded some more and found another copper coin. Then she found still an- other. This went on until she had a hundred copper coins in all. On her way home in the evening, she bought some rice with the money. She did not tell her husband about what she found. “He might think I stole the money,” she thought. “If I keep quiet about it there will be no trouble.” In the field next day she found a silver piece among the weeds. She weeded some more, and upon reaching the edge of the field where bamboos and large trees grew, she heard a voice say: “Do not breathe a word to anyone about your good for tune and you will find more treasure.” The woman walked home, buried the silver piece in a hole, and put a stone over it so that she would remember 105 where it was. She found another piece in the field next day and another the next, and this went on until she had a handful of silver pieces. She hid them all with the first one"

She returned to the field on the seventh day and found nothing more. At noon she walked to the edge of the field where large trees grew. There she gathered three stones, made a stove with them, and built a fire. Over the fire she placed a pot of rice to cook. Before the rice started to boil, she heard the voice again, and it said: “Never mind boiling the rice. Dig right under the fire and you will find all the gold you need. But be sure to say not a single word about it to anyone.” The woman took the pot from the stove, scattered the burning faggots, and began digging in the ground where the fire had been. It did not take long before she struck something hard, and digging carefully some more, she uncovered a very old clay jar as large around as she could encircle with her arms. She was full of excitement. She took off the lid from the jar and saw that it was filled with shining pieces of gold. “What good for tune I have!” she whispered to herself. She reached down to the bottom of the jar and found that it contained nothing but gold. She did not know what to do with so much wealth. She took only two pieces, covered the jar with earth and dry leaves, and hurried home. She was a faithful wife, and the longer she kept the secret from her husband, the more it troubled her. She would lie awake in bed at night thinking how she might continue to keep the secret from him with out feeling that she had been unfaithful. At last, after he got well again, she could keep the secret no longer.

In the dead of night, when no one was stirring, they hurried to the edge of the field to dig up the jar of gold. But to their dismay, the jar had vanished. Likewise the gold she had taken home and the coins she had hidden were gone. So the farmer and his wife became as poor as they had always been. They felt bitter, too, for they knew they could have been very prosperous if the wife had only known how to keep a harmless secret. 107 The Tale of Magbatloto THERE ONCE LIVED, deep in the mountains, a man named Magbaloto. Going to the brook one morning, he came upon three beautiful women bathing. He saw their wings on the grassy bank and then he knew that they were elves. He crept to the bank when they were not looking and stole the pair of wings belonging to Makaya, the youngest elf. Soon they finished bathing and looked for their wings. Makaya could not find her wings and began to weep. Her sisters helped her look for them but they were nowhere to be found. “We have to leave you,” said they, putting on their wings.

Now Magbaloto, having hidden the wings safely, walked to Makaya and said, “Why do you weep, fair maiden?” “Ask me no questions if you will not help me,” she replied. “How shall I help you unless you tell me what your trouble is?” he asked. Makaya told him that she and her sisters had come to bathe in the stream and she had lost her wings. “My sisters have flown home,” she sobbed, “and I cannot fly.” Then Magbaloto lied to her and said, “I am sorry but I know nothing about your wings. I am just a mortal, and what you cannot find, much less can I. But I have my home 108 not far from here,” he added, “and if you come and live with me, I shall be most happy to take you.” Makaya thought it over, and knowing that she could do nothing else, she said, “Thank you. I shall be glad to go with you.” So the elf and the mortal were married. Before another year came, they had a baby, and it was fair like its immortal mother, so that Magbaloto was very happy. One day, while Magbaloto was harvesting rice and Makaya was rocking her baby to sleep, she saw a bundle half hidden in the thatched roof. She reached up for the bundle and opened it, and she found her missing wings there. Hastily she put them on and, leaving the baby, she flew away to rejoin her people. Magbaloto returned and found Makaya gone. She did not reply when he called her and he found that her wings were gone, too. “Alas, Makaya has left me and our baby!” he lamented bitterly. He determined to find her, and leaving the baby with a cousin, he set out to look for his wife. He walked and walked until at last he met the North Wind. “Why do you weep, Son?” asked the North Wind"

Fervently they begged Allah to give them children, but the years fol- lowed one another and no child came. Finally the wife said to her husband, “I don’t think there is such a thing as Allah.” “Of course there is no real Allah,” replied the husband. “We have long asked Allah for children, and what has he given us? Only poverty and old age!” But very early next morning the wife called to her husband, saying: “Husband, husband, come here this minute! Iam having a baby!” “What in sanity has taken hold of you?” he said. “Only last night you were complaining that you were childless. Now you say you are having a baby!” But the woman yelled for help so earnestly that the man went to her, and sure enough, she soon gave birth to a baby boy. “This baby’s birth is a miracle!” said the husband. “What ‘this baby’s birth’ are you talking about?” said his wife. “Help, for here comes another!” And this time she had a baby girl. “Marvelous, marvelous!” the husband said. “Wife, you are really marvelous to give me twins—and at your age!” 115 “What ‘twins’ are you talking about?” she replied. “Help!

I have lost count of our babies.” “All right then,” she replied. “Now see how many there are in all.” With great difficulty the man counted the babies, and he found that his wife had given birth to 102 children, everyone of them a boy except one girl. Soon the babies started crying, and the man and his wife began to worry about how they were going to feed so many babies. By and by the man picked up his kris. “I think,” said he, “that we have too many babies. We must get rid of some of them.” “Stop!” the woman shouted. “Why kill them? Take them to the roadside. There people will pick them up and raise them.” “All right,” said the man. He picked up five of the babies and carried them off. But he did not leave them at the roadside. He walked to the edge of an abyss and threw the babies in. Then he returned home, picked up the next five babies, and threw them into the abyss, too. He did with the rest of the babies what he had done with the first until only the girl remained. When he picked her up, too, his wife exclaimed: “Don’t throw the girl away! We must keep her.” But the man paid her no heed, and he threw the girl into the pit. When he looked into the bottom of the pit, however, he found everyone of the 102 children all alive and walking about. He was much surprised at this and he pitied them.

To begin, what name will you give me?” “Rajah Bagaram!” the others said, and so Rajah Baga- ram he was named. Then to their only sister Rajah Bagaram gave the name Putri Intantiaya.

I beg you to leave before it is too late. Iam his prisoner.” Rajah Bagaram refused to leave and promised to save her. While he was yet speaking, a loud noise was heard, and soon the Ta-awi, a monster most fearful to see, en- tered. “Ah, this is good,” said the Ta-awi. “I thought I would have nothing for supper, but here is a delicious-looking young man. And he is good-looking, too! I shall eat him before I go to bed,” he added, turning to seize Rajah Bagaram.

I did not want you to marry, so I told you to marry only a girl who had gold-tipped hair. But now I will see what can be done to win her for you.” So saying, the sultan or dered seven of his most trusted men to find out where the girl with a gold-tipped hair lived. The men followed the course of the river. They ar- rived at Ingud a Bulawan after passing seven hills and seven mountains. There they came to a palace where they found the beautiful woman of the gold-tipped hair, but they discovered that she was married.

Meanwhile, Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya, while asleep, dreamed that seven men entered the palace, poisoned her husband, and carried her off. She rose greatly troubled and told Rajah Bagaram, her husband, about her dream. She was sore afraid and wrapped her husband in a long skirt, tied both ends of the skirt, and put the bundle ina room. Then she shut and barred the palace doors and waited. 120 By and by the seven men from Banjarmasir arrived. They tried to enter the palace but found all the doors barred. So they taunted Rajah Bagaram, saying: “You cowardly prince! If you are not an effeminate datu, come out of your hiding place and fight!” These words stung Rajah Bagaram’s pride.

The Flying Litter Soon the ninety-nine brothers found the mselves on the playgrounds of the Sultan of Banjarmasir. There the sultan’s subjects were gathered to hear the sultan speak. The sultan told his people that he would give two-thirds of his kingdom to whoever could do two things: make the princess from Ingud a Bulawan speak and stop a mysteri- ous fire from coming between her and his son whenever the latter tried to get near her. 121 But before proceeding with our story, we should tell that when Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya was brought to Banjarmasir, she was very much grieved over her husband’s death. She wept day and night and refused to speak with anyone. And whenever Sumusong sa Alon- gan, the prince, tried to speak to her, a mysterious fire sprang up in full blaze between them.

Feeding strangers is one of the rules of hospitality.” The sultan heard her speak, was delighted, and or- dered that food be served the ninety-nine strangers. Then Sumusong sa Alongan, the sultan’s son, tried to sit beside Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya, but in stantly the mysterious fire blazed forth and stood between him and the princess. So the sultan turned to Maongagen, the Wise, whom he saw was the leader of the strangers, and asked him: “When one of your men made the princess talk, you performed half of the job. Now stop the fire from appear- ing between her and my son, and as your reward I will give you two-thirds of my kingdom.” Maongagen went aside with three of his brothers— with Paririmar, the Diviner; with Barakat, the Worker of Miracles; and with Mabagur, the Strong. Then, having reached an agreement with them, he turned to the sultan and said: “Have a litter built that can hold a thousand people. Then on the litter let the groom and the bride, to gether with your seven most trusted men and your ten 122 best poisoners, be carried around the palace three times. After that the wedding can proceed.” The sultan little suspected the plot and or dered a gigantic litter built. Then he had Sumusong sa Alongan and Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya carried aboard the litter. The seven men who had poisoned Rajah Bagaram and stolen Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya he also sent aboard, and after them the ten men whose poison had killed Rajah Bagaram.

Without difficulty Mabagur raised the litter, in cluding all the people it contained, and the sultan danced with joy. The sultan’s joy, however, was short-lived. For in stead of carrying the litter around the palace, Mabagur gave a sign to Barakat, the Miracle-Worker, who 123 used his magic power to raise the litter to a height of ten rooftops from the ground and make the litter remain afloat there. As the litter rose, Mabagur clambered onto it and stood protectingly over Towan-Putri Malano-tiaya. Then the sultan was seized with terror. “That’s too high, that’s too high!” he cried out. “Now bring down the litter and carry it around the palace so that my son may marry the princess.” But Maongagen turned to the sultan and said: “Sultan of Banjarmasir, it is now the time for speaking.

The men of the village were fond of going out to hunt deer and wild hogs, and one day Sog-sogot went with them. They entered the woods with their dogs and hunted long and patiently but found no game. At last Sog-sogot grew weary with walking. He went off to an open space in the woods and sat down to rest. By and by the sky darkened and Sog-sogot looked up to see a giant bird swooping down to ward him. It was a ban-og, and it was so gigantic that it covered the sun. Sog-sogot ran to ward the trees to hide, but the ban-og pounced on him and seized him in its powerful talons. Then it rose into the air and flew off with him. So terrified was Sog-sogot that he did not know what to do. And there was not much he could do, for the bird had risen high up to the clouds. Sog-sogot knew that if he should loosen himself from the bird’s grasp, he would fall to the ground and get killed. The ban-og flew on and on until it came to a very large tree that stood taller than its neighbors. It circled once or twice and then alighted on the tree. A large nest lay at the top of the tree and two baby ban-og sat in the nest. The mother ban-og dropped Sog- sogot in the nest and flew away. 126 Sog-sogot then knew that the ban-og had brought him there to feed him to its fledglings. As soon as the ban-og had flown away he sought a way to escape. But so high was the nest and so large the trunk of the tree that he could not climb down. There were no branches by which he might descend and no clinging vines which he might hold on to. So he hid in the nest"

Sog-sogot cut off a leg of the deer and ate all he wanted. Then he fed the baby birds with the pigs and what remained of the deer. After they had eaten, the fledglings closed their mouths and fell asleep. Then Sog-sogot hid under the nest and wondered how he might escape. By and by the mother bird came home with more deer and wild pigs. It dropped them in the nest and flew away to hunt for more. He cut off part of the deer open and ate his dinner.

All of our master’s cattle will die, and there will be a lot to eat. Then if we are hungry, we shall enjoy our feast better.” “How do you know all this?” “I just know,” said the cat. The man heard every word and thought out a plan to cheat Death. He did not want to lose his cattle with out getting anything in return. So he drove his cattle to town and sold them all. “I am glad I learned what was about to happen,” he thought, counting his money. “If I had not been warned I would have lost all my cattle.” From then on, whenever he was at the table, he lis- tened closely to his dog and his cat"

Our master gave the food for us to share with each other, and now you want to eat everything.” “Iam very sorry,” replied the dog, “but I have to eat all I can. Hard days are ahead for me. I will share you just enough food to satisfy your hunger.” “And you will eat all the rest?” “Yes, but don’t you worry,” said the dog. “Tonight you will have all the food you want, and I shall have nothing.” “But if I will have food to eat, you will get some, too,” said the cat. “I will give you plenty of food to night if you are not too greedy now.” “There’s no use,” the dog replied. “I will have no time to eat to night. I’ll have a lot of work to do.” “Why?” “Listen closely and I'll tell you,” said the dog—and the man leaned down and listened closely, too. “Our poor master is going to die to night,” continued the dog. “His wife will cook plenty of food for those who will come and see his body. You will be under this table alone and eat all the scraps they throw to you. But I will be under the house keeping away the dogs who will try to steal the food.” When the dog had told his story, the cat said, “I am sorry for you, my dear friend. You may have all the food then.” The rich man heard every word and smiled to himself. “Tam glad I learned about my fate,” he said. “Last time, when I heard that my cows and carabaos were going to die, I sold them ahead of time and cheated Death. Now I will cheat Death too.” 138 So saying, he went to a wise man and told him his story. “Tell me what I should do to cheat Death,” said he"

I must cheat Death as I cheated him when he wanted to get my cattle.” The wise man shook his head again. “That was a big mistake,” he said. “You should not have sold your cattle. You should have allowed Death to get them.” “But I did not want Death to get my property,” said the other man. “If they had died, I would have nothing now.” “I know, but you were wrong to try to cheat Death,” said the wise man. “If you had not sold your cattle, Death would have been satisfied with them.

He was at his prayers one morning when he beheld a vision of Inigambar, a maiden known far and wide for her great beauty. She was so lovely that Diwata fell in love with her and vowed to go and find her no matter where she might be. With the help of his two younger brothers he built a big boat and loaded it with provisions for a long voyage. Then they put out to sea, and for many days and nights they sailed over the water. Diwata felt sleepy one morning and said, “I want to go to sleep. If anything unusual happens, be sure to wake me up.” His brothers promised to do so and steered the boat while Diwata lay asleep. Day followed night and night followed day, but Diwata slept on, and his brothers wondered what strange sleep had taken hold of him. Then they saw the sky darken. They knew that a typhoon was coming, and they tried to wake Diwata up. They splashed water on his face and stood him on his feet, but Diwata remained asleep. Then the typhoon fell upon the boat in all its fury and the vessel broke to pieces. The two brothers were washed 140 upon the shore of a wild, uninhabited island, and nothing more was heard of them. Still fast asleep, Diwata floated this way and that, unmindful of what happened. Time passed and seaweeds and shells grew on his body. His skin hardened, too, and after some years he looked like a log floating about on the sea. Finally, ina storm, he was washed ashore. A man and his wife went out fishing in the sea one day and came upon Diwata’s body. “This log will be good for firewood when it is dried,” said the husband and pulled it home, little knowing what the log really was. “Let us leave it in the yard to dry,” said his wife, and so they did"

They asked Diwata to tell them how it happened that he became a log, and Diwata told them he had fallen asleep on a boat but did not know what happened after that. “Be our son, for we are childless,” said the couple. Diwata thanked them and said he would be very happy to be their son. Diwata Seeks Inigambar One day Diwata was walking in the woods when he heard a great commotion. He asked what the noise was about and was told that the Sultan’s lovely daughter, Inigambar, who had been missing for many years, was being sought in the woods by the sultan’s men. Diwata wondered if this could be the same beautiful young woman whose image he had seen in his vision back in his native land. He asked his foster parents to let him go and look for her, but they shook their heads. “You might meet with some misadventure,” said they. But Diwata pleaded so earnestly that they let him go.

There he found no grass or tree. He only found bones scattered about. “This must be the home of a monster,” he told himself. He looked cautiously about and found a cave. He entered the cave and came upon a magnificent dwelling. Walking in, he saw a beautiful table of solid gold. A golden chair stood on one side of the table and a silver chair on the other. He sat down on one of the chairs, and to his sur- prise two betel-nut boxes—one of gold and the other of silver—floated into the hall and placed the mselves on the table. Diwata understood this to be a sign of welcome, so he took some betel nut and chewed it. Looking around, he saw an in ner room. He entered and found a maiden sound asleep. He walked softly to 142 her side and looked into her face, and great was his joy to discover that she was Inigambar, the woman whom he had come so far to seek. Before long she woke up. She saw him and was delighted. “At last my prayers have been answered said. “My deliverer has come.” She explained that she had prayed earnestly and long for one to come and rescue her. In turn he told her that it was at his prayers that he first saw her in a vision. “Then the Lord must have willed that you come and deliver me,” she said. “From whom shall I deliver you?” asked Diwata. “Have you not heard about the winged monster Garuda?” she asked... “When he flies, his wings sound like ten thunderstorms.

He can carry six men in his talons, and I shudder to think what will happen if he finds you here.” Even as he spoke, Diwata heard a fearful noise from the distance. “That’s the Garuda now!” exclaimed Inigambar. “I must save you!” So saying, she used her magic power and transformed him into a louse and hid him in her hair. Soon the Garuda entered, and the floor shook under his weight. He dropped to the floor the bodies of several beasts and men he had brought home. “Where are you, girl?” he thundered. Inigambar tried to be as calm as she could and met him in the hall. But with his keen scent, the Garuda detected Diwata. “I smell a man!” he said, sniffing about. “You just brought in some dead men, Father,” said Inigambar...“It is they you smell. What living man would be so bold as to enter your palace? Your power is so well known that the world does not ment ion your name above a whisper.” “It is so in deed. But now I want to clean your hair,” said the Garuda. This frightened Inigambar but she did not show her fright. “First let me go in my room and undo my hair- 17 she 144 knot, Father,” she said. She hastened into her room, hid Diwata beneath one of her fingernails, and loosened her hair. Then she went back into the hall.

But now I know you better, and my fear and‘hatred are gone.

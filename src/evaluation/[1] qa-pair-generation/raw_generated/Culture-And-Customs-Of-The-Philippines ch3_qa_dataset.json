      "context": "Page 49 3 Art and Literature PHILIPPINE ART is an amalgamation of in digenous traditions, adopted Western forms, and a vibrant contemporary folk art. The older artistic forms still exist among the country’s many minority peoples, although these traditions are disappearing at an in creasing rate. Western­in fluenced art can be found at two cultural levels. At the high end of culture, artists produce sophisticated works comparable with any others on the in ternational modern art scene. A number of these artists have used their imagination and skill to produce works on the mes of national identity and social commentary. More broadly, Filipinos delight in bright colors and artistic exuberance that enlivens everyday life. This art at the mass or folk level of Philippine culture is seen in resplendent decorations for religious occasions and festivals, in urban popular art, and on the brightly decorated jeepneys (mass transit passenger vehicles first made from post­World War II U. S. army surplus) that ply the nation’s roadways. INDIGENOUS TRADITIONS Pre­colonial Filipinos used art to represent religious notions of the hereafter and their relationship with their physical environment. Archeological evidence from burial jars in dicates an elementary level of technical sophistication in the construction of pottery, with the frequent representation of figures in a boat, suggesting the need to cross a body of water to reach the afterlife. Decorative patterns for other types of pottery used geometric designs and nature motifs. Pottery for everyday use was made in a variety of functional styles, occasionally in the shapes of animal and human figures. In Page 50 addition to domestic manufactures, Filipinos also used Chinese and Vietnamese pottery that was of higher quality and artistic design. Chinese pottery was copied and continues to be made in Vigan, Ilocos Sur province. Also surviving are woodcarvings of grainary gods and human figures"

Chinese pottery was copied and continues to be made in Vigan, Ilocos Sur province. Also surviving are woodcarvings of grainary gods and human figures. Most of these wooden representations have been found either in the northern mountains of Luzon island or among the Muslim peoples of the south. In the latter case, since Islam discourages the artistic reproduction of the human form, the stylized naga serpent; the okir curvilinear design; a variety of vine and leaf patterns; and the stylized sculpture of the sarimanok, a legendary bird with a fish in its beak, were produced in stead.1 Personal adornment was also an outlet for in digenous Philippine artistic in genuity. A few pieces of clothing from cave site explorations reveal that many pre­colonial patterns are still echoed in the patterns woven by to day’s minority peoples. Natural materials from simple barkcloth to fibers made of pineapple, abaca (a hemp), and other plants were used for clothing, while in digo and other natural agents, in cluding ginger, colored woods, and mud with high iron content, were used to dye the material in a range of subtle colors and shadings. To supplement clothing, many early Filipinos made extensive use of tattooing. Sometimes a tattoo was added as a mark of a man’s ability as a warrior, but among lowland Filipinos tattoos were adopted simply as beautification. This latter practice was especially true of the in habitants of the islands of the Visayas who decorated the mselves with a wide variety of geometric and floral designs. This practice led the early Spaniards to refer to Filipinos as los pintados, or the painted ones. Hats, meanwhile, were either made of gourds or were woven of rattan or certain substantial leaves"

This practice led the early Spaniards to refer to Filipinos as los pintados, or the painted ones. Hats, meanwhile, were either made of gourds or were woven of rattan or certain substantial leaves. Woven cloth, as well as mats and baskets, were decorated with floral designs and imaginative multicolored geometric patterns, some of which created optical illusions. It appears that jewelry was first adopted for use as amulets and charms to ward off evil spirits and later assumed an or namental role. Multicolored beads, tusks, and water buffalo horn were combined with brass chains and bells to make necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and anklets and were sometimes worn in conjunction with elaborate tattoos as part of one’s permanent body design. In some areas of northern Luzon and Mindanao, gold and silver were fashioned into disk neckpieces. Other metal pieces were made into forms of stylized animal figures, and precious metals were supplemented by brass and coiled copper wiring. Local metalworking was adopted by the residents of Luzon’s Central Cordillera and the Muslims of the south to make brass gongs. Meanwhile, a few groups developed a lost­wax technique of sculpture to create a mold of wax that was melted away by molten brass to create human figurines. The most ambitious metalwork was reserved for Page 51 weaponry, such as the tips of spears carried by warriors of the Central Cordillera region and the or nately decorated iron kris, a wave shaped sword, carried by the Muslim men of the south.

THE HISPANIC ARTISTIC TRADITION The arrival of Spanish colonizers in troduced a strong tradition of religious art that persisted until the nineteenth century.2 This religious emphasis was not entirely alien to the Filipino, but the new European artistic mediums were different and revolutionary in their impact. Filipinos soon learned engraving, sculpture, oil painting, and architecture because their skills were needed to build and decorate churches and produce religious publications. Meanwhile, traditional skills in woodcarving were pressed into service to produce figures of saints and decorate altars and floats for religious processions. While hints of pre­existing native sculptural styles in corporating spirits such as the anito occasionally appeared in the works of native craftsmen, their labor was usually supervised quite closely and displayed little in dividuality or in novation. Metalwork advanced since all churches needed bells and the Spanish military needed cannons, while fancy grillwork was used for the windows on the ground floor of prestigious homes. Finer metalwork was reserved for crucifixes and various religious pendants that served as amulets of the Christian faith just as earlier amulets protected pre­Christian Filipinos. Gold and silver from the galleon trade that was not transshipped to China was of ten made into fine women’s jewelry and for the adornment of religious images.

Whatever medium employed, Filipino artistry advanced very little until the nineteenth century because of the strict for mulaic religious constraints set by the Iberian tradition. By the latter period, a wealthy clientele of Spanish and Chinese mestizo elite customers began to patronize secular art for the construction and adornment of their new masonry homes, and this elite group was not as constrained in their artistic traditions. The one basic requirement for homes in the Spanish Philippines was furniture for storage, since houses were not designed with closets. Just as large finely carved cabinets, or aparadores, kept the priest’s vestments safe and clean, so, too, were a variety of cabinets required for the cloths, table linens, bedding materials, and tableware in the homes of wealthy mestizos. As the mestizos in creased their wealth, simple crude benches were replaced by more elaborately designed ones and finely crafted chairs, of which the most prestigious was the but aca, or planter’s chair, with its woven rattan mesh cradle Page 52 for the sitter and flat armrests extending far beyond the chair for use as a foot and leg rest. Gradually, too, beds replaced mats that had for merly been spread on bamboo floors. The graceful Mariposa (but terfly)­style rattan sofa appeared in the living rooms of the better homes, and the European­style high table for dining surrounded by sets of simple straight­back chairs made their appearance in more and more homes.

Whether small wooden statues or oil paintings, these tipos del pais (types of the place) were purchased by nineteenth­century visitors to the colony, who had come on business and were in terested in taking home a souvenir. Also of in creased popularity among the new mestizo wealthy were portraits that could be hung in their homes and displayed their wealth and social status. This in creased demand for something other than for mulaic religious art supported the most famous artist of the period, Damian Domingo, whose paintings and lithograph reprints still command high prices.3 In 1821, Domingo opened the country’s first art school, and it was eventually under the in fluence of this school that Philippine painting turned even more to landscapes and everyday scenes. By the second half of the century, a few Filipino artists went to Europe to study, and some even won high praise. In 1884, Juan Luna won a gold medal at Spain’s national arts festival held in Madrid for his massive painting Spoliarium. Interestingly, this work, depicting the body of a Roman gladiator being dragged off a stone floor of combat, was actually a subtle critique of the colonial experience, revealing the artist’s true feelings. In Luna, the colonial subject had absorbed and even perfected the artistic culture of the master well enough to win fame even while using his art to critique the Iberian master.

TWENTIETH­CENTURY ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENTS Art in the early American period was dominated by two men, the painter Fernando Amorsolo and sculptor Guillermo Tolentino. Amorsolo’s rustic landscapes of bountiful harvests, contented farmers, and smiling young women framed in warm tropical sunlight speaks of a nation at peace and enjoying life. His work set the tone and the standard of the pre­World War II era. Quite different was the sculpture of Tolentino that was based on the restrained classical forms he mastered as a student in Rome, but whose energy seems ready to burst forth in emotion. Among his most important works is Page 53 the monument to assassinated revolutionary hero Andres Bonifacio, which is a landmark in the Manila suburb of Caloocan City, where the Katipunan leader first assembled his followers to rise up against Spain. Tolentino also sculpted the Oblation, a naked male figure looking into the sun with outstretched arms, which serves as the symbol for the University of the Philippines.4 Even during the American period, but especially after World War II, the dominance of Amorsolo’s school of painting was challenged by a group of modernists led by Victorio Edades, who believed that the subject of art should in clude the ugliness of life as well as the beautifully idyllic. What he and his fellow artists in troduced were some of the major trends then being developed in the United States and Europe. Edades sought to in troduce a full range of feelings and passion to the canvas as well as modern styles of art such as cubism, abstraction, and figurative expressionism.5 Especially after the trauma of Japan’s wartime occupation, Edades’s modernist school reigned supreme, and two of its members, Vicente Manansala and its lone woman member Anita Magsaysay­Ho, became prominent"

In Angono town, the folk tradition was first developed by modernist Carlos Francisco and has since been kept alive by Jose Blanco and his talented children, whose realist genre of large paintings featuring the actual residents of their town brings national and in ternational praise. The 1960 s witnessed a further turn to ward social realism in art, especially during the two elected presidencies of Ferdinand Marcos. The young artist Ben Cabrera represented the new style of artist, using a number of mediums, such as painting, printmaking, and etching as well as the mixed media of photography and painting to present his social statements most effectively.

Each jeepney is specially painted and further in dividualized with additional lights; mirrors and reflectors; plastic streamers hung from antennae; hood decorations, such as standing chrome horses; letterings of favorite song titles; paintings of rural scenes or women in erotic poses; extra decals and chrome strips everywhere; the name of the manufacturer (usually Sarao Motors); and the proud nickname of the driver, “Lover Boy,” “Jeepney King,” “Action Kid,” etc. In addition to its customizing, the jeepney will also display a license plate on the front bumper and a signboard across the top of the windshield giving the jeep’s route for potential passengers to see. The jeepney’s in terior is like no other vehicle on the planet. Curtains are hung along the open sides of the passenger compartment, the ceiling of which Page 58 A jeepney.

In the front, the driver will frequently have a small shrine that in cludes a plastic icon of a saint, most of ten St. Christopher or Our Lady of Perpetual Help, upon which might be hung a sacrificial garland of the strong sweet smelling sampaguita flowers.

Somewhere among the driver’s collection of icons and personal amenities are the actual gauges for the vehicle, but these of ten do not work and are irrelevant. The passengers and driver enter into a communal relationship during a trip, with passengers helping each other on the jeep, passing fares up to the driver and repeating a request for a stop in case the driver did not hear the passenger who asked to get off. Thus, in microcosm the jeepney displays the communal nature of Philippine society. Unfortunately, the jeepney is a communal form of transportation in decline. At its height in the early 1980 s, there were almost 30,000 jeepneys in Manila, but the need to conserve fuel and space on crowded city streets has led to a sharp restriction of jeepneys in favor of larger, more fuel efficient buses, especially those that feature air Page 59 conditioning.

In these areas, as in other aspects of Philippine culture, such as music and film, the adaptive process works to the benefit of the whole. LITERARY TRADITION Unlike music and other forms of art and culture, Philippine literature remained relatively free of colonial in fluence until the nineteenth century, which allowed it to retain its in digenous character as an oral tradition for a relatively long time. Philippine literature, especially poetry, was relatively unaffected by Spanish colonial in fluence because the Spaniards were not in terested in passing along their language to Filipinos. Spaniards in the Philippines did not in struct the natives in their language, unlike their policy in South America, but, rather, kept knowledge of the language from the natives to limit their ability to challenge colonial authority.

Thus, Filipino literature remained largely an oral tradition relatively unaffected by Iberian culture until the nineteenth century when changes in the in ternational economy saw the emergence of a class of native and mestizo elites who gained access to the colonizer’s language. Once Filipinos gained a working knowledge of Spanish, in digenous oral traditions were modified by Iberian and European cultural in fusions. In effect, Spanish finally became the unifying lingua franca for the archipelago, which otherwise has a large number of dialects. Use of the colonizer’s language permitted a cross­fertilization of knowledge and accelerated the breakdown of regional differences. The somewhat ironic result of this linguistic adoption was that by the latter decades of the nineteenth century, Spanish, rather than an in digenous national language, became the language of Filipino nationalism. The national hero Jose Rizal was a medical doctor, essayist, poet, and amateur folklorist, but he is best known for his novels, which were written in Spanish and criticized the ruling Spaniards and their native syco­ Page 60 phants. Philippine literature in Spanish was thus the single most powerful weapon in the nationalists’ arsenal. Although the literary tradition of writing in Spanish continued during the American period, the new North American colonial ruler actively promoted public education and the English language. The short­term impact of this American education and language policy was dramatic, and its long­term in fluence cannot be overestimated.

In literature, too, as generations of Filipinos passed through the country’s school system, the nation’s novels, short stories, poetry, and literary criticism gradually became molded by American sources. As a result, Filipino literature and poetry written in English appeared relatively early and continues as a strong tradition to day. At the same time, however, the country’s major dialects did not disappear and actually grew in strength thanks to the spread of basic literacy and benign American policies to ward the media.

In addition, the of ten overlooked, but important, phenomenon of the Pilipino Komik should not be for gotten in a literature survey. For many Filipinos, the lowly komik has served as a powerful medium of entertainment and as a bellweather for social values and societal change. While komik books have been stigmatized as escapist reading for the uneducated lower class, the komik has a general popularity, especially among teenagers and housewives, that is akin to the popularity of comics in Japan. Finally, beginning in the American colonial period, the deliberate non­use of English became a mark of in tegrity for some writers who developed the national language and local dialects. Many of these vernacular writers selected to pics of social concern and nationalism for their writings and became leading social critics and ac­ Page 61 tivists. In retrospect many of these socially conscious writers produced some of the best pieces of Filipino literature in the 1930 s and 1940 s even though their English­ writing colleagues were winning all of the accolades. More recently, the Philippines has seen a strong in crease in the use of Pilipino among the country’s writers, poets, and literary critics.

Pre­Spanish Oral Traditions Riddles, proverbs, and aphorisms were the basis of the Philippine’s oral literary tradition, and collectively they served as the foundation of native poetry.11 These forms were created in villages and were either spoken around a fire after an evening meal or put into song for entertainment. Most of this oral tradition spoke of daily life, such as working in the fields, fishing, and hunting, as well as love, marriage, sickness, and death. Much of the oral tradition also in cluded folk stories about amusing characters whose tales imparted lessons of behavior for young and old. Some of these stories, such as the popular Tagalog folktales about Juan Tamad, live on in contemporary popular culture. Sometimes these oral recitations in cluded verbal jousts between friends and young lovers and provided a means of education and entertainment. Even on present­day Philippine radio and television programs, the balagtasan, or contests in verse or prose, are a popular means to debate a variety of facets of daily life and personal relationships. Other tales in volved animals, such as the mythological bird, the Sarimanok, and the story of “The Tortoise and the Monkey,” a pedagogical story popularized by Jose Rizal.

As is true of many other cultures in Southeast Asia, these epics told stories of heroes and gods whose exploits and foibles serve as models of behavior and cherished values, and their tales were carefully crafted by gifted storytellers. Undoubtedly, these stories shifted over time to address, in allegorical form, matters of concern to the community. While many of the epic stories, such as the tale of the first Filipino man and woman, Malakas at Maganda (The Strong and the Beautiful) are nationally known, others such as the Ilocano story Biag ni Lam­ang (The Life of Lam­ang) are specific to an ethnic group.

They also provide the basic framework for more than a few contemporary stories, modern dance productions, plays, and poetry that continue to enrich Philippine life. As such, the pre­Hispanic oral tradition is a genuine literary expression of the people and has grown to suit the needs of the nation.

In addition to dictionaries and grammar books that were beneficial to the missionary effort, the religious presses also printed catechisms, prayer books, confessional manuals, and hymnals. As part of their missionary efforts, Spanish priests used local traditions and adapted them, so the native song, the dalit, for example, quickly became a form of religious lyric poetry. In fact, poetry and songs from the pre­colonial oral tradition were the earliest Philippine literary forms to be printed.12 The most complex and important of the lyric poetry was the Pasyon, or the story of the life and death of Jesus Christ. The earliest version of the pasyon was published in 1704 by Gaspar Aquino de Belen but that was later eclipsed by another version in 1814. Both versions were written in Tagalog and became the basis for the practice of public recitations called pabasa, which are performed during the Lenten season, while a staged version of the pasyon, the sinakulo, is performed throughout Holy Week. The popularity of the Tagalog pasyon soon spread throughout the colony and was translated into other Philippine dialects.13 While the dominant social values of humility and submission to authority were clear in all versions of the pasyon, in fact, other social values such as honor and goodness are also present in the story"

A prominent historian of the Philippines, Reynaldo Ileto, has argued that the social­religious values widely disseminated through the annual recitations of the pasyon actually for med the ideological message that linked the welleducated elites of the anti­Spanish revolutionaries of the late nineteenth century with the broad base of their uneducated fellow countrymen and women.14 Beyond the Spanish era, the basic storyline of the pasyon continues to lend itself to modern use when adopted by creative writers. In 1935, Pascual Poblete wrote Patnubay ng Binyagan (Guide for the Baptized )a pasyon for Page 63 the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI), a nationalist Filipino church created by a nationwide schism from the Roman Catholic Church in 1902. In this work, Poblete compares the pasyon of Jesus Christ to the struggle of the Philippines to gain in dependence from the United States. Another example from the 1930 s is Lino Dizon’s pasyon, which has Christ as a socialist while peasants are crucified by the vicious hacienda system. A more recent social revolutionary portrayal of Christ is Francisco Rodrigo’s 1970 Pasyon Si Kristo ay Rebelde (Christ Is a Rebel), which critiqued the pre­martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos.

At first this secular poetry was set to the musical forms of the awit and the korido (romance songs of love and adventure) and consisted of little more than Filipino versions of European stories of kings, queens, and courtly love and were consistently from the perspective of the Spanish colonizer. However, by mid­century as native frustration with Spanish excesses accumulated, this new secular literature began to find a political use. Francisco Baltazar was especially proficient in this new use of literature and writing. Under the pen name of “Balagtas,” his 1838 narrative poem Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Cahariang Albania (An Account of the Life of Florante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania) became the first entry in a literature of protest. In this narrative poem, the oppressive nature of the kingdom of Albania is a clear metaphor for the excesses of the Spanish regime in the Philippines, and the pure­of­heart lovers Florante and Laura must overcome the evil designs of King Adolfo.16 A significant break with the literary past occurred in the latter decades of the nineteenth century as the colony became drawn into the world’s economic system.

Page 64 Jose Rizal best epitomized the young Ilustrado group, and it was he who brought the literary efforts to the greatest height. Although a masterful essayist and poet, Rizal’s best known works are his novels Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not, 1887) and El Filibusterismo (The Subversive, 1891), both of which use realism rather than religious or folk allegory.17 In the first novel, the young hero Crisostomo Ibarra returns home from Europe filled with hope of serving his people as a school teacher and using education to liberate his native land from the hand of colonial oppression.

It remained for other nationalists such as Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Aguinaldo to raise the standard of revolution and free the country from Spanish rule. Meanwhile, Rizal paid dearly for his writings. Arrested and tried on dubious charges, he was executed by a Spanish firing squad on December 30, 1896, even as those who advocated a violent overthrow of the colonial regime were already engaged in battle. The committed nationalistic prose of the pre­revolutionary Propaganda Movement continued during the fight against Spain and then against the United States. The generation of Ilustrados writing in Spanish published a small number of newspapers for the Aguinaldo government and produced essays, manifestos, and poetry denouncing the Yankee imperialists.

One of those essays was Aves de Rapina (Birds of Prey), which was published in the Spanish­language newspaper El Renacimiento in 1908. This satirical essay pilloried American colonial of ficial Dean C. Worcester, who promptly sued the paper for libel. The case was especially important because of the chilling effect it had on the Philippine press that had just been freed from a number of wartime constraints. The case became well known on both sides of the colonial political divide.19 In addition to the writers already ment ioned, it is necessary to cite the nationalist and post­World War II Philippine Senator Claro M.

The use of Pilipino was in timately linked to nationalism, especially in the face of the American cultural on slaught. Even during the American colonial period, publishing in the vernacular in creased markedly as did its appreciative audience. Writers in the vernacular enjoyed the advantage of being able to build upon the culture’s pre­Hispanic oral tradition and were especially accomplished at poetics. Using the chanted verse, many talented Tagalog poets were soon producing a number of volumes. Especially prolific was Jose Corazon de Jesus, who produced a number of poems, balagtasan verses, satirical pieces, and songs, such as the beautiful nationalist hymn Bayan Ko, which is discussed further in Chapter Eight on music. At the same time, the socially committed writer Lope K. Santos wrote verse narrative in addition to his newspaper columns and satirical commentaries. The oral tradition also served as the basis for the short story, and a number of writers around the country soon became known as the fathers and mothers of the literature of their local dialect. Assisting the growth of vernacular literature was the founding of a series of regional magazines, many named after the dialect they were printed in, that carried the fiction of these writers, serializing their novels as well as publishing poetry and short stories. The growth of vernacular literature, especially in Tagalog, was further spurred in the 1930 s as the Philippine film in dustry was established and quickly gained popularity.

The four magazines of the Liwayway chain catered to the nation’s major dialects and had a weekly circulation more than five times greater than the English language The Philippines Free Press. Beyond sheer numbers, these magazines translated novels from one dialect to another to tap additional readers and the reby created a mass market chain that was a powerful in fluence on the emerging national vernacular literary style. The vernacular was given a further boost in the late 1930 s as Filipino political leaders anticipated an eventual break from American rule and the need to develop a national language. In 1937, Commonwealth President Manuel Quezon proclaimed this need and proposed a national language based on Tagalog.25 The in creases made by local literature were further reinforced during the Pacific war when the Japanese occupation government outlawed English language publications, and many writers in Page 68 English began to experiment with their native languages. With the prewar development of a solid base, vernacular literature held its own during the immediate postwar period, when the use of English returned and reached its apex. In the early American period, the most notable contributor of the vernacular writers was Lope K. Santos, the “Father of the Tagalog novel.” Santos not only developed that language’s literature, but he provided a bridge between the romanticism of the Spanish era and the social realism of the American period that has continued to characterize the best of vernacular literature. Building on the Spanish tradition, Santos combined his activism in journalism, labor unions, and socialism with literature to great success in his startling 1905 novel Banaag at Sikat (Glimmer and Light)"

Santos’ pioneering efforts were followed by other socially committed writers, such as the accomplished Faustino Aguilar who also concerned himself with issues of for eign domination and agrarian exploitation. An early work of Aguilar is Pinaglahuan (Eclipsed, 1907), which used a love triangle to deliver a stunning socialist critique of society. This theme was further developed in his 1926 novel Lihim ng Isang Pulo (Secret of an Island). Another socially committed writer of the 1930 s was Lazaro Francisco, whose novels explored Central Luzon’s tenancy system, which sapped the life out of the farmers. Francisco’s in terest in social responsibility helped him produce especially good works after the war with Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig (The World Is Still Beautiful) in 1956 and the sequel Daluyong (Tidal Wave, 1962).26 The socially relevant terrain was dominated in the postwar period by Amado V.

In keeping with its oral and poetic or igins, the contemporary period was in itiated by poets who wrote in Tagalog, but who are equally versatile in English. Additionally, some younger writers began to experiment with Taglish, a hip urban mixing of English and Tagalog that gives the writer additional linguistic complexity to craft double meanings and situations of social satire. One group of these young university educated writers compiled Manlilikha, Mga Piling Tula: 1961–67 (Creator, Selected Poems: 1961–67, 1967) that aspired to an in ternational “modernismo” and was dense in its in tellectualism. Meanwhile, another group of poets emerged from the country’s premier Jesuit university, the Ateneo de Manila, and in cluded Rolando Tinio who used Taglish in Sitsit sa Kuliglig (Calling The Cricket, 1972) and Dunung­Dunungan (Know­It­All, 1975).

Sison. In 1971, a radical writer’s group PAKSA (Panulat para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan or Literature for the Advancement of the People) united many of these writers in discussions of social conditions and explorations of Marxism, especially those developed during China’s Cultural Revolution.28 This early literary experimentation in poetry and the subsequent turn to socially relevant and protest literature had parallels among the nation’s young short story writers and novelists. The early 1960 s saw the development of two mutually exclusive approaches among short story writers, the realists and the existentialists. The for mer group sought alternatives to romantic and escapist literature while their stories sometimes employed a stream of consciousness technique as they described everyday characters who usually lived in contemporary urban settings. At the same time, the Philippine literary scene was heavily in fluenced by European existentialism, the ideas of which allowed writers to break with existing for malism and find shelter from the threatening real world. Western notions of angst and ennui typified the works of many writers who followed this latter philosophy of literature.

Each of the novels is set in Jose’s hometown of Rosales, Pangasinan, and confront issues of national identity and the exploitation of one Filipino by another. Jose’s work is a true saga, taking a family through the turmoil of history such that they are sometimes even torn from each other as even brother exploits brother while fighting oppression and landlordism. Despite the trials the family is put through, there is a theme of social justice as the antidote needed for Philippine society. Jose’s works have at tracted greater in ternational at tention than many other Philippine authors, and his books are available from for eign popular presses.29 Jose’s underlying hope for the future and his faith in the Filipino’s potential was not always shared by his contemporaries.

Under the slogan of “literature from the masses, to the masses,” writers of poetry, short stories, and novels recommitted the mselves to social concerns and examined their use of language in the process of communication. The result of this self­examination process was not simply the in tentional use of the vernacular, but also a search for the most direct and simple words and story lines and a renewed in terest in folk traditions and popular literature and storytelling. Among the leaders of this movement were Clarita Roja (A Comrade Is as Precious as a Rice Seedling, circa 1982), Rogelio Sicat, Ricardo Lee, and Lualhati Bautista. With the imposition of martial law in September 1972, the Marcos government sought to suppress such “committed” writing but could not. Some writers joined the resistance movement in “underground” activities that produced literary works such as Magsasaka: Ang Bayaning Di Kilala (Farmer: The Unknown Hero, circa 1970), an anthology of protest literature. Still other authors remained “above ground” and continued to test the regime’s limits.30 Since the popular movement dubbed “People Power” and the revolt by government rebels that overthrew the Marcos regime in 1986, the nation’s writers have not for gotten the lesson of their activist past.

Like their American counterparts, the Philippine komiks began as entertainment supplements in the vernacular magazines of the pre­World War II period. After the war, these became in dependent publications and by the 1980 s had blossomed into approximately fifty titles that had a combined circulation of over two million with a huge diffusion rate as friends and neighbors passed and traded the komiks between the mselves. Since the komiks are very in expensive, this was a very affordable form of literature, and they are readily available at almost any magazine stall and even corner stores (sari­sari stores). The komik for mat is also used to mold opinion by a variety of agencies, such as government agriculture programs and private fertilizer companies seeking to disseminate the latest planting in structions to farmers. Page 73 By far the most frequent use of the komiks is for entertainment. The use of detailed graphics and simple dialogue in captions and dialogue balloons allows even those with a minimal reading ability to follow the stories of their heroes. Even when a part of other magazines, such as Liwayway, the komiks developed their own stable of stock characters and situations. Sometimes these were modeled on American models, but they also in cluded the barrio doctor and the local Chinese merchant. These komiks were in tended only for humor, but when the komik became an in dependent publication, they became a vehicle to present short stories and serialize novels"

These komiks were in tended only for humor, but when the komik became an in dependent publication, they became a vehicle to present short stories and serialize novels. The or iginal humorous function of the medium remained but was supplemented by soap opera­style romances, adventures, supernatural tales, and stories based in the Filipino folk tradition. It was through this development of the medium that the komik became linked to more “highbrow” Philippine literary developments, and writers such as Clodualdo del Mundo began to write for this literature along with his writing of standard prose for print journals. Female characters are represented rather strongly in the komiks, but these women are of ten associated with the supernatural, such as Darna, the simple barrio girl who happens to possess supernatural powers (a Philippine­style Wonder Woman), and the lovely siren Dyesebel. The for mer became especially popular and was featured in a whole series of Tagalog movies in the 1960 s. Male hero figures predictably right wrongs against seemingly in surmountable odds thanks to their in credible powers, and they always emerge triumphant whether the setting is urban or rural. Women are also the center of the extremely popular love story komiks as they rise above tyrannical lovers, unreasonable family demands, and exacting parents, in cluding cruel mothersin­law. These stories, especially, deliver powerful messages of esteemed social values and behavior that are not lost on the komik’s reading public. Beyond geographic setting and the cultural emphasis of various universal human the mes that are present in the romance stories, the komiks also utilize Filipino folk sensibilities and myths"

This Philippine folk tradition in corporates such elements as supernatural tales of monsters, vampires, talismans, and enchanted for ests in its reinforcement of cultural beliefs and symbols.34 As is true of other aspects of Philippine culture, the Filipino people have in corporated various forms of for eign literature and the languages of Spanish and English while retaining elements of their own culture that are refracted through the use of these new mediums. Philippine reality, values, perceptions, traditions, and social­ political concerns are evident in the nation’s literary genres propagated in a variety of language and dialects.

Next, the or igins and development of Philippine the ater is explored, in cluding its in digenous forms and the for eign in fluences that have deepened this medium to become a vibrant expression of Filipino values and a mirror of the social changes and political concerns of the modern nation. Moving on to a more technologically developed cultural product, the Philippine film in dustry, one of the most productive in the world, is examined. Despite the ubiquitous presence of Hollywood films and in roads made by VCRs, the local movie in dustry remains extremely popular and reflects cultural values and social concerns as few other aspects of Philippine culture can. Closely connected with the film in dustry, the nation’s newspaper, radio, and television in dustries perform many of the same functions. How these in dustries grew and their present state will be looked at briefly before turning to sport and games. Here, the Filipino’s fascination with basketball and cockfighting is highlighted, since they, as well as a number of children’s games, illustrate the passions of the common folk for competition and social celebration.

The celebration of holidays usually has significance at deeper levels that in cludes agricultural life, religious devotion, societal values, and familial bonds. As well, the country’s festivals gave birth to significant forms of the Philippine’s the at rical tradition, some of its music, and even aspects of its literature and art. The first­time visitor to the Philippines is immediately aware that most of the country’s celebrations are religious or are at least heavily in fused with religious meaning and symbolism that reflects the sincere religiosity of the people. Clearly, the dominance of Roman Catholicism is not limited simply to its having the largest number of adherents. Its cultural impact is deep and long­lasting and is apparent during celebrations. The social importance of these festivals is, perhaps, less noticeable but it is just as important as the religious aspect. Festivals serve as opportunities for the wealthy to display the mselves and for the reaffirmation of commonly held societal values and the central importance of the family. Festivals are also central to the lives of the country’s non­Christian ethnic minorities, such as the people in the Central Cordillera Mountains of the main island of Luzon and the Islamic peoples of the far southern islands. As well, celebrations associated with the Philippine’s national existence serve to in still pride in the country and in the united Filipino people.

All of these festivals and holidays play a role in for ming a Philippine cultural identity. The Town Fiesta The festival combining the most cultural and religious elements is the annual fiesta honoring a town’s patron saint. The fiesta is directly linked with the Roman Catholic church, but the fiesta’s relationship with the municipality is a secular dimension to the celebration that is less obvious but also important and rooted in the nation’s history. During the Spanish colonial period, the creation of an in dependent parish for a specific community was an important step in the process of its becoming an autonomous municipality. Since the colonial government in Manila wanted each town to be under the administration of a priest, only those communities would rise to full municipal status. Communities that only rated a visiting priest were virtually doomed to remain dependent barrios under the sway of an established municipal government. Thus, the celebration of the feast day of the patron saint is also the celebration of the town’s existence and identity. Today, long after the presence of a parish priest has been dropped as a requirement for the creation of new municipal governments, the importance of the fiesta remains for all to wns. Just as the fiesta is a merger of the religious and the secular, the actual celebration is also the product of a combined effort.

Membership on these committees and one’s position in the or ganizational hierarchy is a clear in dication of social status and, more practically, how much money one is contributing to the event. The annual fiesta is unique, since the religious and secular halves in the planning must closely coordinate, which is not always the case in other celebrations. During celebrations that are strictly religious, such as Holy Week, there are no additional secular festivities and, conversely, secular events such as Independence Day do not have a religious component. Since the fiesta has a strong link to the community, to wns compete with each other as a matter of pride to see who can put on the best fiesta, and some to wns are locally famous for the quality of their celebration, so there is a tremendous pressure on all of the town’s citizens to participate and contribute, even non­Christians and in dividuals not known for their religiosity.

In fact, care must be taken to visit friends and social and political allies during the fiesta and to have at least a little something to eat as not to give of fense by appearing to snub a friend. Yet, the Philippine fiesta’s most important and basic social function is an opportunity for families to reunite and maintain their tight bonds, this sometimes in cludes distant relatives as well as members of the nuclear family. Filipinos will make extraordinary efforts to return to their hometown for fiesta. This behavior is true even for Filipinos who may have migrated to a far distant city many years or even decades ago and whose lives now have little connection to their extended family’s rural past. Even though it might be more convenient to visit the old ancestral home on other occasions, the pull of the town fiesta is usually overwhelming.1 Major Christian Religious Festivals As a historically Christian country, the Philippine’s religious holidays are similar to those celebrated in many other countries. There are, however, some in teresting variations on the actual celebration of common Christian holidays Page 142 and some particular holidays are emphasized more in the Philippines than other places.

Christmas is certainly a central feature of religious devotion and is celebrated in the Philippines as elsewhere with Santa Claus, caroling, manger scenes, the Christmas tree, and gift giving. In addition, many Filipinos have a star­shaped lantern, or parol, made of bamboo sticks and colored paper hanging in their window symbolizing the star that guided the Magi to the Christ child. San Fernando, the capital of Pampanga province, is even noted for its Christmas lantern festival. All churches hold early morning (about 4 A. M.) masses, the misas de gallo, for nine days before Christmas to build anticipation. In some communities, the celebrations extend until January 6 with the Feast of the Three Kings, during which special pageants and plays are held. Another extremely important holiday is the extended period of Lent that is celebrated as elsewhere, but with some markedly different variations. For example, on Palm Sunday, artistically wrought palms are brought to the church for the priest to bless after mass. They are then taken home and hung over doorways and windows in the belief that they will protect the occupants from evil spirits. As well, it is of ten customary during the holiday for town residents to gather nightly for a pabasa, where they sing and recite the story of Christ’s passion. Many to wns additionally stage religious plays, sinakulo, where various in cidents in the Passion are acted out.

The beating continues until their backs are pieces of bleeding raw flesh and then vinegar is rubbed into the wounds. Some of the more fanatical believers will actually have the mselves nailed to wooden crosses that are then raised for a short time with the faithful flagellant hanging in imitation of Christ. In some to wns, Easter Sunday services are also combined with a ceremony called the salubong, or encounter, in which two entourages, one being the image of the risen Christ and other that of the mourning Virgin Mother, are taken on separate routes from the church until they encounter each other at a specially constructed platform in the town plaza. One especially artistic Lenten festival variation is the Morion, or mask, festival held on the island of Marinduque. This festival is based on the legend of Longinus the Roman centurion, who was blind in his left eye and who pierced Christ’s side with a spear. As Longinus drew the blade out, a drop of blood landed in his eye, restoring his sight. The centurion immediately Page 143 converted to Christianity but was put to death by his fellow Romans as a result.

Unlike the playful American Halloween, All Saints Day is a serious national holiday during which public transportation is in extremely short supply as entire cities seem to leave for the provinces, and highways are jammed with vehicles. Other Religious Festivals Filipinos celebrate a number of other religious holidays, some of which are within the Roman Catholic tradition while others combine pre­Christian elements with Catholicism. Among the more traditional are the numerous Marian festivals honoring the Virgin Mary. For example, there is one Marian festival held in thanksgiving for the defeat of at tacking Dutch ships by the Spanish navy in the mid­seventeenth century (the La Naval de Manila), a celebration that continues to the present day. Numerous, other Marian festivals in parishes around the country or iginated because of a miraculous event or apparition associated with a carved image of Mary. There are also a number of festivals associated with the worship of the Holy Child. Principle among these is the veneration of the image of the Christ child, the Santo Nino, or iginally brought to the island of Cebu by Ferdinand Magellan. The image was found almost fifty years later by a soldier in Don Miguel Lopez de Legazpi’s expedition, when the Spaniards returned to establish a colony, and is to day the centerpiece of a massive festival in Cebu City.

In the days of perilous sea travel when so many ships were lost to storms and pirates and when disease took even more lives, many people would visit the Virgin to ask her protection before starting on their journey. The idea of travel by water and the importance of rivers in Philippine life is accented by a number of special fluvial celebrations that have pre Christian or igins.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHILIPPINE THEATER Theater in the Philippines enjoyed its audience peak in the pre­electronic era of the late Spanish and early American colonial periods. In the nation’s capital and numerous provincial to wns, the population was entertained by a variety of productions ranging from the religious sinakulo to the comedic romantic farces of the sarsuela. During the unsuccessful fight for in dependence in the early years of this century, the the ater also fulfilled the important function of spreading the nationalist message, of ten under the very noses of the American enemy. Later, while many the at rical troupes folded and the at ers either closed or switched to show the new “moving pictures,” Philippine the ater remained alive simply because it fulfilled the human needs for self­expression and artistic creation. Foreign in fluences continued to enter during the American regime and in the modern era so that to day’s Philippine the ater can truly be said to have a sophisticated in ternational connection rare for an Asian nation. In addition, the social and political edge or iginally seen in the anti­American “seditious plays” of the turn­of­the­century continued to reverberate in socially conscious the ater during the years of Ferdinand Marcos, and this spirit still enlivens contemporary the at rical productions"

Most of these plays celebrated holidays such as Christmas, Lent, or Easter and they are still staged in to wns across the archipelago. A popular form of play is the komedya, also known as the moromoro plays, that in variably feature battles between Christian and Muslim adversaries in medieval Europe. The moro­moro frequently in cludes narrations about the lives of patron saints and has magical events that come to the rescue of besieged Christians. These plays conclude with the mass conversion of the defeated Muslim enemies thus ensuring a warm and appreciative reception by the audience.8 The most frequently staged religious play is the sinakulo, also known as the pasyon, which begins with creation but focuses its at tention on the life and death of Jesus Christ. The pasyon is performed during Lent and for eight nights during Holy Week. The quality of productions range from relatively simple recitations to elaborately staged affairs supported by prominent members of local communities as an aspect of their devotional duties. In this particular gift­giving activity, the donors do not expect any immediate social return, but their generosity does underscore their social­economic position in the community. The importance of the pasyon cannot be overemphasized because it is still popular among the faithful across the country and because Page 150 it is within the context of the annual performance through which religious and community values are transmitted and reaffirmed. Scripts for the pasyon were also an early form of Philippine literature with the first written in 1703 by Gaspar de Belen. The story was later adapted to the country’s numerous regional dialects. Since the pasyon is so pervasive, its message has had an impact that extends far beyond the strict confines of religion"

While the Spanish friars sought to use this vehicle for their own purposes, moral teachings, like ideas, cannot easily be controlled. Philippine historian Reynaldo Ileto has convincingly argued that the moral lessons of the pasyon as staged annually in community after community became the ethical framework that guided commoner Filipinos during the revolution against Spain and the resistance to American domination.9 In addition to the komedya and the sinakulo, there are a number of other religious plays performed during specific holidays and events, such as the Tatlong Hari (Three Kings) seen during Christmas and a large number of productions for other important religious days, especially Easter. One of the more colorful of these latter plays has become a festival event in and of itself.

The in strument for a new the ater came through the teaching of English in the new American system of universal public education.

This state of the in dustry resulted from the traditional the at rical base from which Filipino films first developed; the dominance of American films in the Philippine market, which denied the domestic in dustry a critical and demanding audience; and the propensity of the in dustry to ape American genres and fads. Despite the odds, however, some Philippine films have always emerged from the pack to equal those produced anywhere else in the world. This was certainly true from the early 1970 s through the late 1980 s when a number of young directors, writers, and actors came on the film scene after the demise of a stultifying studio system. Many of this younger generation have since been lost to tragic deaths and early retirements, which have affected the in dustry. Still, some quality films are made every year, and Philippine films continue to entertain the fans and reflect contemporary reality on the big screen.

Later, when U. S. troops arrived in 1898, they brought along a cameraman to make a film record of the “glorious” expansion of the new American empire. Private American companies were also quick to enter the new colony; in cluding the Biograph Company that sent Raymond Ackerman to make films from 1898 to 1902.15 But, it was not until 1909 that the first short film was actually made in the Philippines and even then it was made by an American resident, Albert Yearsley. Three other Americans, the most prominent of whom was Edward Gross, also founded the first film company, Rizalina Photoplay Company, in 1912. Interestingly, all of the ex­patriots produced films that gave a sympathetic representation of the Philippine revolution, which occasionally caused them trouble with American military censors, who were anxious to dampen the fires of nationalism. For in stance, in 1912, Yearsley’s film version of Walang Sugat, the sarsuela by Severino Reyes, had to be with drawn after eleven days of screening. Censors also demanded that scenes be cut from Los Tres Martires (The Three Martyrs), the story of the three Filipino priests executed by the Spanish colonial government in 1872.16 The pioneer of the domestic Philippine film in dustry was Jose Nepomuceno, who purchased the failing Rizalina Company’s equipment in 1919 and made the first truly Filipino film, Dalagang Bukid (Country Maid) based on a sarsuela script. In the 1920 s, a few young Filipinos were at tracted to the glamorous world of Hollywood where they learned the techniques of the craft.

Soon, he and Nepomuceno churned out an ever­in creasing number of silent films, and in 1932, they and other newcomers produced 23 feature films. Though impressive, this limited output was not able to satisfy the country’s demand for motion pictures. In 1926, American companies controlled 95 percent of Philippine motion picture distribution, and this dominance of the in dustry was still 90 percent in 1937.17 Just as the fledgling film in dustry was getting established, however, it was confronted with the need to adopt the new technology of sound motion pictures. Because Philippine filmmakers operated on very limited budgets, they were hard enough pressed to purchase the expensive new equipment and could hardly afford to make the additional in vestment of constructing a modern sound stage. So, after making some in itial progress, it appeared likely that the nascent domestic in dustry might not be able to keep pace with modern in novations and would be swamped Page 158 by the imported American “talkies” that were drawing the crowds away from the silent Filipino films. American in vestors came to the rescue of a moribund Filipino film in dustry in the form of George Harris and Eddie Tait, who decided to in vest in a production studio in Manila as part of their plan to make films for the budding Asian market. Their in vestment capital and equipment; the founding of their company, Filippine Films, in 1933; and a business alliance with Nepomuceno brought the needed technology to the Philippines to make motion pictures with sound.

The success of the American company and the collapse of the or iginal Filipino film in dustry pushed Philippine filmmakers to form studio companies of their own in cooperation with local moneyed in vestors. In a short while, the Philippines had a number of studios that slowly lifted the in dustry back to life.

As well, Hollywood films at tracted the country’s in telligentsia, because English was the language of status. Since Filipinos had linguistic access to films made in the United States, the door was open to the idealized world of the American Dream. As the educated members of society were effectively lost to local companies they, in turn, had Page 159 to cater to the less educated poor Filipinos who made fewer artistic demands. This demographic reality stigmatized the audience and reinforced genre trends in the films produced. It is said that the derogatory term bakya (Pilipino for the wooden clog slippers worn by the poor) for the patrons of Filipino films was coined in the 1950 s by a movie director who was in sulted that local audiences could not appreciate his artistry.19 Since its beginnings, the film in dustry has followed for mats first developed in the country’s the ater, such as the sarsuela plots of Walang Sugat and Dalagang Bukid.

Meanwhile, the in fluence of American vaudeville was seen in the popularity of musicals and slapstick comedies. A frequent theme in many films was the need for the hero and/or heroine to overcome odds dealt by an unjust society controlled by the rich. In both pre­ and post­war Filipino melodramas, a common plot motif is the love triangle in volving either young lovers or married couples, which is of ten complicated by class differences, family in terference, and sometimes by contrasts between urban and rural lifestyles. In films a standard character is the long­suffering and faithful woman and/or mother, such as Ang Luha ng Ina (A Mother’s Tears), and occasionally the abused and suffering child such as Roberta (1951). In many cases, the in fluence of the kontrabida (the anti­hero), usually an actor who is well known for playing that particular role, is overcome after an extremely traumatic event and an extended tearful reconciliation in volving all the parties. Since all melodramas had a common for mat with simple variations, they clearly catered to their bakya audience. Occasionally, however, some of these films rose above the milieu, such as 1954’s Malvarosa, staring Charito Solis as the long­suffering Rosa who sacrifices herself to the care of her five shiftless brothers and is almost raped by her scheming wealthy employer.

However, in this case, one reviewer pointed out that the film’s strength is due to its “restraint” and the absence of “long­winded dialogue” and “long weeping scenes or extended dying scenes” so typical of most local films.20 One important criticism of the Filipino melodrama is that because they all seem to end on a hopeful note with even the most evil of oppressors and villains having a miraculous change of heart defying logic and reality, they effectively uphold the status quo by conditioning the poor to accept their status in life. Page 160 Philippine films also have a bevy of “stars” who enjoy the adulation of their fans. Some actors play clearly identified roles, such as the kontrabida (anti­hero) or the bida (hero) in the melodrama and action genres, and it remains a common practice to match up young stars in romantic duos in tended to heighten the in terest of their fans who see them in film after film. Even for mer Philippine president Joseph Estrada was a major movie star long before entering politics. In his films, he played the honest avenging policeman safeguarding the poor and downtrodden. It is little wonder that when he first became vice president, Estrada volunteered to lead a national war on crime, which continued his movie role persona and further in creased his popularity with the electorate.

Despite the weight of the standard genres, the late 1940 s through the early 1960 s witnessed two important and fundamental changes. The most immediate change was the appearance of some films in which disillusion over post­war Philippine political corruption and social conflict was clearly portrayed. One such film was Backpay (1947) where for mer anti­Japanese guerrillas openly talk of joining Communist rebels because of the government’s failure to in stitute land reform and give them backpay for their wartime service. Another of these films was the powerful Anak Dalita (The Ruins, 1956), which featured Tony Santos and Rosa Rosal as a couple who have to live in the post­war ruins of the old Spanish section of the city. Adding to the pathos is the fact that Santos’s character is a Korean War hero who must become a smuggler in or der to live.

Page 161 The second major development of the era was the decline and eventual demise of the major studios. This situation was prompted by labor problems in the early 1960 s, which led to a number of major stars leaving the studios. The decline was accelerated by the deaths of some major studio heads, and eventually the only remaining major studio was Sampaguita Pictures. The way was clear for smaller in dependent companies to capture a bigger portion of the market and for fresh talent to emerge.

The True Golden Age The 1970 s and 1980 s saw the rise of a new generation of directors who helped redefine Filipino film, making it an effective vehicle for social commentary and the artistic equal of any other national film in dustry. Their efforts were also in tune with the period’s in creased activism and nationalistic awakening, which led people to reconsider their prejudices against locally produced films as something only worthy of the bakya crowd. As well, various governments began to take active measures to support the local in dustry. As early as 1966, the city of Manila sponsored its first film festival, stipulating that for ten days only Filipino films could be shown in the city’s the at ers.

Charo Santos Concio, a prominent TV and film producer with Regal Films, which produced a good number of the pictures made by the outstanding directors, has since lamented the resulting lack of passion in the in dustry.21 The low point was reached in 1996, when two actors and their agent made a pathetically in ept at tempt to manipulate the winners in a nationally televised award ceremony. During the 1998 centennial celebrations, film enthusiasts had to content the mselves with the retrospective showing of forty of the Philippine’s best films. In defiance of this discouraging trend, screenwriters Ricky Lee, Jose Lacaba, and others still produce first­rate scripts, and some directors, such as Marilou Diaz­ Abaya, continue to make quality films, in cluding Milagros (1997) and her 1998 of fering Sa Pugod ng Dagat (In the Navel of the Sea), which was shown at the Berlin Film Festival and then went on an extended in ternational tour before its opening in Manila.

PHILIPPINE MASS MEDIA Since the overthrow of the oppressive Marcos regime in 1986, the Philippines has regained its reputation for having the freest mass media in Asia.

As a consequence, the young Filipino nationalists of the nineteenth century could not use the power of the press until they at tended universities in Europe. There, they soon established the newspaper La Solidaridad that was smuggled back home, where it was considered subversive by authorities. During its brief existence, the in dependent Aguinaldo government established a series of newspapers, but these were suppressed by U. S. for ces. Also in 1898, new papers were started by recently arrived Americans, while some Spanish newspapers remained in business for the newspaper reading elite, who were educated in the Castilian language. A few nationalistic Filipino papers appeared during the early American period, but they had to be very cautious with their editorial commentary, since the new government had a series of laws in place to limit dissent.

Although English­language newspapers are still the preferred reading of the movers and shakers of society, more Filipinos than ever before are getting their news from Pilipino newspapers. A 1995 survey of twenty Manila dailies, ten each in English and Pilipino, revealed that the vernacular papers now have a substantially greater readership.26 Since the end of the Marcos regime, there have also been many technical advances by the electronic media, especially television, which uses digital technology and satellite and microwave transmissions to create a national grid. Despite its post­1986 resurgence, the Philippine broadcast media has not developed qualitatively, and some fundamental problems remain. Principle among its problems is the continued preponderance of American in fluence and the use of English. While Filipino musicians enjoy greater access to the airwaves, many radio stations still broadcast Top 40 hits straight from the United States and the use of English by announcers remains commonplace.

Common to all soaps is a centering on tragic women characters who are portrayed sympathetically as the repositories of all that is good and moral.

The answer is that every town, and even many barrios, have a central public plaza with a cement surface for drying rice during harvest time and for playing basketball throughout the rest of the year. As well, the only real cost of the sport is for the ball, unless to urnament participation also requires a uniform, and there is no great need for or ganization as a pick­up game can always be had readily.

      "context": "7. QUO VADIS, PHILIPPINES “The AFP remains in a state of almost to tal denial … of its need to respond effectively and authentically to the significant number of killings which have been convincingly at tributed to them. The President needs to persuade the military that its reputation and effectiveness will be enhanced rather than undermined by acknowledging the facts and taking genuine steps to in vestigate. When the Chief of the AFP contents himself with telephoning Maj-Gen Palparan three times in or der to satisfy himself that the persistent and extensive allegations against the General were entirely unfounded, rather than launching a thorough in ternal in vestigation, it is clear that there is still a very long way to go.” —From a press statement by Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions; Manila, February 21, 2007 S TEADY E DDIE A GRADUATE OF W EST P OINT AND A CAREER MILITARY MAN, President Fidel V. Ramos (1992-98) had seen combat as a platoon leader during the Korean War and from 1966 to 1968 headed the non-combat Philippine Civic Action Group in Vietnam. Steady Eddie, as he was called by many for his seemingly unflappable disposition particularly during the tumultuous years of his predecessor as president, was from Pangasinan Province in northern Luzon and was on his mother’s side second cousin to Marcos. In 1972, Marcos appointed Ramos to head the Philippine Constabulary, the agency primarily entrusted with enforcing martial law and many of whose units were blamed for the profligate abuse of human rights committed while Marcos ruled as a dictator. Though Ramos must have at the very least known of such abuses, he somehow avoided the taint of criminalization. Whatever taint there may have been was washed away by his helping to lead (along with Enrile and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement) the successful People Power uprising against the regime. In his capacity as Corazon Aquino’s chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and later on, as the secretary of national defense, he helped save her administration from seven coup at tempts. No one was surprised then that she endorsed him to succeed her as president. Aquino herself had steadfastly refused to run and continue on as president, even though the one-term limit set by the 1987 constitution did not apply to her since she ascended to power in 1986. Whatever the shortcomings of her administration, and there were many, she herself was held in high public regard. A political ingénue at the outset and a reluctant ruler, Aquino possessed an in nate decency and modesty, shunning the extravagance that had been the signature of the Marcoses, especially Imelda, choosing, for in stance, to live in the presidential guest house rather than Malacañang proper, to symbolize the difference between her and her immediate predecessors. She had a calm demeanor, underneath which lay a steely resolve that stood her well during the tumultuous years of her presidency. With no allegations of personal corruption— though the same could not be said of her family—she was a saint in the eyes of the public. Her endorsement of Ramos thus carried considerable weight. Not only were there presidential elections in 1992, there were elections for every government position in the country, in cluding municipal councilors. Congress had decided the previous year that both local and national elections were to be held at the same time, on the same day. An astonishing eighty thousand candidates vied for more than 17,000 seats. Twenty-three years after the last freely held presidential elections, Filipinos trooped to the polls. Ramos, a Protestant, won, in spite of the Catholic Church hierarchy coming out against him, and with barely a quarter of the vote but enough to edge out the six other candidates, in cluding Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco, one of Marcos’s closest cronies and Cory Aquino’s estranged cousin, who had returned quietly in 1989. Senator Joseph Estrada, from another party, for mer movie action star and an unabashed Marcos loyalist, secured the vice-presidency by a wide margin, positioning himself as likely the next president once Ramos’s term was up. The 1992 elections reflected the rather stark fact that the glory days of the two-party system were over. Before martial law, one belonged either to the Nacionalistas or the Liberals, with affiliation based more on political convenience than on party platforms. True, the Nacionalistas and the Liberals participated in these elections—Vice President Salvador Laurel for the for mer and Senator Jovito Salonga for the latter—but they fared poorly. There were other parties now, such as Marcos’s Kilusan Bagong Lipunan (New Society Movement), Lakas ng Tao (People Power), Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Hope for a Democratic Philippines), National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD), and the People’s Reformed Party. Ramos had for med Lakas ng Tao, and allied it with the NUCD as well as with an obscure party, the United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines. These post-Marcos political parties were however no more distinct from each other as the Liberals had been from the Nacionalistas, the or iginal Tweedledum and Tweedledee of Philippine politics. Philippines 2000 As all presidents before him, Ramos promised change. Marcos had his New Society; Ramos came up with “Philippines 2000.” By the millennium, he wanted the country to join the ranks of the newly in dustrialized countries and thus be an Asian tiger as well or, at the very least, a cub. He envisioned a strong state, as he put it in his 1993 State of the Nation speech, “that can assert our country’s strategic in terests because it has relative autonomy over the in fluence of oligarchic groups…. We have had a political system that has been too responsive to groups possessing wealth and power enough to bend the State to their will. Such a political system has distorted our economy and rendered government in effectual.” Under Ramos, the manufacturing of export goods was accelerated and the economy further deregulated to at tract more for eign capital. Civil aviation, shipping, telecommunications, and the oil in dustry, for example, were subjected to deregulation. Export-processing zones were established in designated strategic areas, where for eign firms could set up shop with less stringent government controls, create thousands of new jobs, and stimulate the local economies of the region they were located in, whether in Metro Manila, Baguio City in northern Luzon, or Cebu—the latter the business hub of the Visayas, where the surge in the economy, accompanied by an accelerated real estate development, came to be known as “Ceboom.” The Ramos administration continued the dismantling began by the Aquino government of both state-owned enterprises and monopolies"

One of its biggest success stories was in facilitating the availability of telephone lines to consumers. Telecommunications had long been dominated by the Cojuangco- owned Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. It wasn’t uncommon for a family to wait years before a line could be had, and even then it might be shared with another family—referred to commonly as “party line”—leading either to frostiness on both ends or a live-and-let-live accommodation. With deregulation, competition markedly in creased so that, by 1996, at least thirteen companies provided service and at favorable rates. Ramos also hastened decentralization began under Aquino, decreasing state bureaucratic power in favor of stronger local governments, with a corresponding in crease in their share of government revenues. But Ramos’s Philippines 2000 was conditioned on economic development models largely used by the affluent West but that would not necessarily translate well in a developing Third World country. In a sense, it was a one-size-fits-all plan that came at the expense of agriculture—the traditional base of the economy and source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos—and burgeoning in dustries that concentrated on self-sufficiency, one that disregarded in digenous culture and traditions. The free-market export-or iented approach was encouraged by in ternational lending in stitutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank—and opposed by nationalists, hard-line Marxists, and various nongovernmental or ganizations, especially those that provided social services to the poor in lieu of failed or nonexistent government programs. Too, the Western model favored by technocrats had arisen ironically due to historical factors such as colonialism and the corresponding systematic exploitation by the colonizers of the colonies’ natural wealth and resources. The native comprador class and the elites benefited hugely, the concentration of wealth among their ranks a major reason why a vigorous middle class never emerged. To follow such a model blindly then would in effect make the country a party to its own continuing exploitation. Government corruption however proved to be as deeply rooted and as in tractable as before. As much as 45 percent of pork-barrel funds for lawmakers wound up in their personal accounts. President Ramos himself conceded that at least twenty percent of the government budget was siphoned off due to corruption. This was, for in stance, glaringly evident in the shoddy state of in frastructure in many provinces, where stretches of paved road alternated with barely passable ones and where bridges damaged by typhoons of ten took an in or dinate amount of time to repair. Age-old hurdles remained the same: too many people lived at poverty level, and lacked access to safe water, basic health care, and decent housing. Government economic policies were conditioned on the classic trickle-down premise, the idea that a rising tide lifted all boats. Unfortunately, the rising tide of ten swamped smaller, rickety boats. Triggered by speculation, a severe economic crisis afflicted Asia in 1997 and threatened to lead to a global one. Sudden devaluations undermined several Asian currencies, particularly those of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, and Indonesia, and led to a subsequent in crease in for eign-debt ratio to GDP. While the Philippine economy was hurt—growth in 1998 was near zero—it wasn’t as hard hit as its neighbors, being that the country still hadn’t been that well in tegrated into global financial markets. Efforts by the Ramos government to stabilize the peso by unloading as much as $4.5 billion depleted for eign reserves but did prevent the peso from a drastic free fall. Domestic enterprises that relied on imports cut back and laid off workers, causing a surge in unemployment. On the other hand, depreciation of the peso helped boost exports, which narrowed the trade deficit. And the remittances of the overseas workers, amounting to almost $6 billion, provided a much-needed financial cushion. Thus, the country emerged from the 1997 crisis a bit bloody but unbowed. In 1999, the economy rebounded and grew by more than 3 percent. Contributing to President Ramos’s growing reputation as a capable manager was his handling of the energy crisis and the in efficient water supply system that had long plagued Metro Manila. Power outages, known as brownouts and sometimes lasting as long as twelve hours in smaller cities, were so regular during Aquino’s term that they were a national embarrassment. Energy shortfalls averaged 1,000 megawatts daily. Demand had far outstripped supply; the nation’s power plants were too few and antiquated. The need for businesses to purchase generators added considerable expense to their overhead. Such deficiencies in the power in frastructure discouraged potential for eign in vestors. In response, the Ramos government, granted emergency powers by Congress, issued licenses to in dependent contractors to construct power plants, with the proviso that these were to be up and running within 24 months. By 1994, the power crisis had been almost completely resolved. Only one problem remained: power was available but the rates were the second highest in the region, with Japan taking the lead. Japan, however, was the world’s second-largest economy. Similarly, Ramos moved to deregulate the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System, the government body charged with providing potable water to Metro Manila’s ever-expanding population. By 1992, the National Capital Region (Metro Manila’s of ficial designation) had close to 10 million residents"

Similarly, Ramos moved to deregulate the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System, the government body charged with providing potable water to Metro Manila’s ever-expanding population. By 1992, the National Capital Region (Metro Manila’s of ficial designation) had close to 10 million residents. The system in place had been built during the American colonial era, suffered extensive damage during World War II, and had never really been repaired fully, let alone upgraded. Through financing arranged through the World Bank, four firms—two for eign and two local—committed $7 billion to improving and modernizing the system. The New Heroes Despite improvements in the economy, the exodus of workers for employment overseas continued unabated. In 1996, for example, over a six-month period, according to the Philippine government’s National Statistics Office, the number of registered workers going abroad for employment, or Overseas Filipino Workers, was 900,000. By 1999, that figure had reached 1,043,000. According to a 2007 cover story by Jason De Parle in The New York Times Magazine, in 2006 the exodus was enough to fill six 747 planes daily. Of the population of 92 million, approximately 10 percent live abroad, with Filipino workers scattered throughout 170 countries. The article noted, “There are a million O. F. W. s in Saudi Arabia alone, followed by Japan, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan.” The largest segment of the diaspora was and continues to be in the United States, where close to 4 million Filipinos live. Abuse of overseas Filipino workers, especially of domestic workers, has been a recurring problem. Two cases made the front pages and dramatically illustrated how life abroad for these women (for most if not all domestic workers were women) was fraught with not only alienation and loneliness, but physical danger as well. Later, the stories were to form the basis of two critically acclaimed Philippine feature films. The first case in volved Flor Contemplacion, a middle-aged domestic worker in Singapore who was accused of murdering another Filipina domestic and drowning the child in the victim’s care in 1991. Contemplacion was eventually convicted of the murders in 1995 and sentenced to die by hanging. However, two Filipina witnesses came for ward with evidence purporting to show that Contemplacion had been framed for the murders. According to them, the child had in advertently drowned in a bathtub and the father had been so in censed by his son’s death that he killed the nanny and then framed Contemplacion. The Singapore courts considered the evidence proffered but decided to let the conviction stand. Contemplacion was hanged despite President Ramos’s plea for clemency. Her death became a cause célèbre, with the city-state’s punitive act sparking numerous demonstrations against Singapore in Manila and other Philippine cities. The Philippine for eign Secretary resigned and the ambassador to Singapore was recalled, with Ramos suspending diplomatic relations between the two countries. Ramos had referred to Contemplacion as a Bagong Bayani, or a “New Hero,” an unambiguous recognition that the monies sent to the Philippines by OFWs were essential in keeping the economy afloat. The term became part of standard government rhetoric when referring to overseas workers. Such rhetoric aimed to defuse public wrath at Malacañang’s perceived in eptitude and powerlesness when it came to protecting its own citizens abroad. (From time to time, the government honors the returning overseas workers with a red-carpet reception at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and a chance to win cash prizes.) The Contemplacion case speeded up the enactment later that year of the Migrant Workers Act by Congress, in tended to recognize overseas workers’ rights and outlining specific steps to protect these rights. A few months after the hanging of Contemplacion, in September 1995, another Filipina domestic worker, this time in the United Arab Emirates, was convicted of stabbing her employer thirty-four times and killing him. Sarah Balabagan, a fifteen-year-old Muslim Filipina, claimed self-defense as the man, having raped her once, was at tempting to do so again. After two trials, she was found guilty of premeditated murder, with the second court ruling that there was no evidence of rape. After a plea from the UAE’s ruling sheikh, the late employer’s family agreed to accept payment of blood money—donated by a wealthy Filipino businessman—a year’s imprisonment, and one hundred strokes of a cane. According to Balabagan, the dead man’s family cheered at each stroke of the cane. In 1996, the young woman was deported to the Philippines. That year alone saw 14,000 complaints of abuse filed with the government’s Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. Contributing to the ever-pressing need for jobs, with the resultant unceasing exodus for greener pastures overseas, was the high rate of population growth. One major reason top Catholic prelates in the country had stood against Ramos was not simply because he was a Protestant, but that he might promulgate government policies aimed at lowering the country’s birth rate. In contrast, the convent-bred President Cory Aquino, known in for mally as a Catolica cerrada (literally, a closed Catholic), devout and deeply conservative, had essentially ignored the population problem. During her term, annual population in crease was 2.35 percent. (It had declined to 2.04 percent by 2007—still one of the highest growth rates globally. By 2050 the population is expected to exceed 150 million.) Aquino’s conservatism reflected the local Catholic hierarchy’s own. In 2003, Cardinal Sin’s responded flippantly when queried by The New York Times about the fast-growing population: “The more the merrier.” The church steadfastly opposed curbing the population growth through condoms and other artificial contraceptives, which it condemned as immoral, favoring in stead the rhythm method or abstinence"

To show that he was serious about family planning, Ramos appointed Dr. Juan Flavier, also a Protestant, as secretary of health. The doctor had been the president of the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction as well as the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement and had acquired a no-nonsense reputation when he worked as a doctor among the poor barrios of Cavite and Nueva Ecija provinces, witnessing the difficulties of a subsistence life, compounded by the lack of family planning. He proved to be a colorful, plain- speaking physician who had no qualms about shaking up the Catholic hierarchy’s obstinate refusal to consider contraceptives as morally legitimate to ols for dealing with unwanted pregnancies. Flavier would himself of ten distribute condoms to popularize the need for reducing the country’s population growth. At the end of Ramos’s term, the annual population in crease of 2.35 percent under Aquino was lowered closer to 2 percent. The Post-U. S. Bases Era The bases treaty had been rejected in the last year of Cory Aquino’s term. Five months after Ramos took of fice, on November 24, 1992, Subic Bay Naval Base ceased to be American territory. (Clark Air Force Base, as noted in the previous chapter, had been effectively shut down even before the Senate vote, due to Mt. Pinatubo’s cataclysmic eruption and the subsequent heavy damage Clark suffered.) A contingent of U. S. Marines prepared to depart as the Stars and Stripes was lowered, permanently drawing the curtains on U. S. occupation of the base that began in 1899. As President Ramos remarked, “There has been no day that for eign troops were not based on our soil,” with for eign military presence finally ending after more than four hundred years. Part of the Ramos administration’s ambitious plan for modernization in volved converting the for mer Subic Bay Naval Base into a free port, a regional hub where for eign corporations could take advantage of the facilities left behind by the United States. These in cluded in dustrial warehouses, power plants, residential housing, a 9,000-foot runway, and even a golf course. Within the vast complex were a 5,000-acre watershed area and a 10,000-acre rain for est, whose resident in digenous tribe had for decades taught jungle survival skills to U. S. soldiers. The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) was created in 1992, after the U. S. with drawal, to oversee development and to make sure that the looting, of ten in collusion with local military units, that had stripped Clark Air Base bare would not be repeated. President Ramos appointed the mayor of Olongapo, Richard Gordon, as the SBMA head. The with drawal of the U. S. troops had adversely affected the region’s economy; Gordon had actively campaigned for the retention of the bases. Now he proved up to the challenge of recasting the baselands as the major component of a revitalized economy. Security was tightened, volunteers from Olongapo City were in itially recruited to help maintain the site, and the rain for est and watershed areas protected from poachers and illegal logging. The centerpiece of the redevelopment was the Subic Special Economic and Free Zone, slated to in clude in dustrial parks, a ship and maritime center, to urism, a financial center, and private businesses. By 1996, Gordon and his staff were able to convince more than 200 companies to in vest over $1.2 billion in Subic. Among these companies were Federal Express, Enron, Acer (a Taiwanese computer firm), and Hutchinson Whampoa, a Hong Kong shipping company. Gordon would later parlay his success and win a Senate seat in 2004, the reby positioning himself for a future presidential run. One thing the SBMA and the United States military did little or nothing about was the environmental pollution at Subic. Over the decades, the United States military personnel produced tons of hazardous and to xic wastes, absorbed into the ground, dumped into the bay, dispersed through the air, and buried within landfills. These to xic wastes posed very real dangers to base workers and the mostly poor villagers who lived along the base’s perimeter—dangers that in cluded exposure to asbestos, low-level radiation in the waters due to nuclear- powered vessels (a threat to marine ecosystems), and unexploded or dnance—this last has caused some deaths and severe in juries among scrap metal scavengers. Of five million gallons of wastewater emptied into Subic Bay daily, only a quarter was treated, with lead and other heavy metals drained from ship-repair facilities directly into the bay. A 1992 U. S. General Accounting Office study of environmental problems at Subic listed three major health hazards: PCB contamination, to xic lead and other hazardous substances, and fuel and chemical leakage into the soil and groundwater. The report also ment ioned the presence of the lethal poison pentachlorophenol and the to xic metal lithium. The GAO report noted that “at the time of our review, the Air Force and the Navy had no plans to clean up at these sites.” Nor did the 1988 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two countries of fer any legal recourse. On the contrary, it absolved the United States of any responsibility. It stated: “The United States is not obligated to turn over the bases to the Philippines at the expiration of this agreement or the earlier relinquishment of any bases in the condition in which they were at the time of their occupation.” There were social costs as well"

Olongapo and Angeles cities were well- known rest-and-recreation havens, particularly during the Vietnam War, when approximately a million servicemen passed through. The brothels, bars, massage parlors, and other related businesses took in $135 million a year. Out of the countless liaisons between the men and the bar girls, an estimated 50,000 mixed- race childen were born. Most were abandoned by the fathers, their care and upbringing left to their impoverished mothers and a few social agencies. Dealing with the Army During Ramos’s six years in power, the military was quiescent. Its restive elements, such as RAM, could hardly complain now that one of their own was at the helm. Ramos was a career of ficer, a veteran, and one of the principals behind the ouster of Marcos. Though he stood firmly by Aquino’s side while his brothers in uniform tried to oust her, he never came down unduly hard on the miscreants. To further demonstrate his fraternal solidarity, in 1995 Ramos granted blanket amnesty to military rebels in volved in various coup at tempts. (The amnesty may have backfired. One of those pardoned was Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan, one of the founders of RAM, who was in volved in the various coup at tempts against Aquino. In 2003, Honasan, already a senator—he had won in 1995 and 2001—was once again a prime suspect in a failed coup at tempt on July 27 against the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Implicated by the mutineers, the senator vowed to clear his name. He was implicated yet again in another at tempt in 2006, for which he was arrested and held at a military camp. In early 2007, a regional trial court cleared him of any in volvement with these failed coups. He ran for reelection in May of 2007 and won.) But if military malcontents ceased to plot against civil government under Ramos, nevertheless the army and the Philippine National Police (the result of a merger between the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police in 1991), along with the auxiliarly militia Citizen Armed Force Geographic Units (CAFGU), continued to be accused of perpetrating human-rights abuses against labor activists, religious personnel, journalists, community or ganizers, and their supporters in both city and countryside. Often, those arrested were framed for crimes they did not commit; being in jail as a common criminal rather than a political detainee posed considerable difficulties for human rights or ganizations working on their behalf. One type of genuine criminal activity that did see an upsurge between 1993 and 1997 was kidnapping, with wealthy Chinese Filipinos the favored target. The abductions were usually carried out with military precision. Not surprising, as the perpetrators were more of ten than not for mer and active military personnel, crooked cops, guerrillas from both the Communist and Moro in surgencies; in short, professionals with and trained in the use of guns. Wealthy families responded by sending their children to study abroad and beefing up their own private security details. The lure of illicit lucre even led to bizarre cases of preemptive kidnappings that targeted middle-in come professionals. A potential victim would be for ewarned by a kidnap gang to pay a stated amount of cash, on threat of carrying out the kidnapping. To combat the crime wave, Ramos appointed Vice President Estrada to be his anti-crime czar. Unfor tunately, Estrada’s silver-screen macho prowess as a crime fighter did little to discourage criminals. And his seeming preference for frontier-style justice led to charges by human-rights or ganizations that the government anti-crime units were too quick on the draw, with suspects of ten killed before any judicial proceedings could begin. The most brazen outfit to engage in kidnappings was the Mindanao-based Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), supposedly a militant Islamic renegade branch of the MNLF and founded in 1991 by Abdurajak Janjalani, who had trained and fought as a mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Russians. The ASG’s for mal name is Al Harakatul al Islamiya, or the United Islamic Movement. Abu Sayyaf (meaning, in Arabic, “Father of the Sword”) was said to be one of many “lost command” groups—a term that refers to a smaller breakaway faction that supposedly had cut off ties with its for mer parent group but in reality still worked clandestinely with the larger outfit. This tactic enabled, for in stance, both the MNLF and the MILF to disavow the ASG while benefiting from the fact that the latter was tying down military units hot on their pursuit. A thorn in the military’s side since the early 1990 s, with bombings and at tacks on poor Christian villages, the ASG purported to be fighting for an in dependent Islamic homeland in the southern Philippines and was believed to obtain some funding from Al Qaeda, through one of Osama bin Laden’s brothers-in-law, Mustapha Jammal Khalifa, who had married a Muslim Filipina and set up a charity in Mindanao. Upon the death of Janjalani in 1998, and under the leadership of his twenty-three-year-old brother Khaddafy Janjalani—who would himself be killed in a 2006 gunbattle with the police—the ASG reverted to kidnappings and assassinations that seemed motivated by financial gain rather than any ideological or religious motives—the main reason why its support among local Muslim populations was low. In one year alone, the ASG was reported to have received more than $10 million in ransom monies. The ASG used some of its loot to buy off both local politicians, so they would turn a blind eye to their presence, and army commanders to not pursue the gang so earnestly. In its modus operandi, the ASG was nothing if not bold. Among the many criminal acts it carried out was the abducting of 21 to urists and workers from a Sipadan, Malaysia, resort in 2000, and twenty vacationers from a Palawan resort in late 2001"

In 2002, of the twenty vacationers, three hostages remained in the hands of the ASG (the others having been ransomed or killed earlier, with one victim, Guillermo Sobero from California, beheaded): a missionary couple, Martin and Gracia Burnham, and Ediborah Yap, a Filipina nurse. A rescue operation mounted by U. S.-trained Philippine Rangers that same year resulted in the deaths of Martin and Ediborah and the rescue of Gracia. The Insurgencies Continue In 1996, the Ramos administration concluded an agreement with Nur Misuari and the Moro National Liberation Front. The five provinces that had voted for autonomy—Basilan, Tawi-Tawi, Sulu, Lanao del Sur, and Maguindanao—would make up the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), to be governed by a Misuari-led administration. A precedent, somewhat, had been set when President Aquino in 1987 had by executive fiat authorized the creation of the landlocked Cordillera Admini strative Region (CAR), in northern Luzon— home to the Igorot in digenous peoples—consisting of six provinces and the city of Baguio. The designation was to be a step to wards an autonomous region but in a plebiscite in 1998, the regional in habitants rejected the idea, preferring in stead the current setup, which provided for in stance for more local consultation with to wns and villages, but not as much authority as would have been legislated under an autonomous framework. The agreement may have meant the end of hostilities between Manila and the MNLF, by then a pale version of its 1970 s self, but not the cessation of armed conflict in Mindanao. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the breakaway faction led by Hashim Salamat (noted in an earlier chapter), was still at violent odds with the central government and the or etically with the MNLF, though the two groups steered clear of each other. Neither side wanted to fight brother Muslims. And if the MILF could gain concessions from the Ramos government, then the MNLF conceivably would benefit as well. Islamic fundamentalism, hinted at by the MILF’s more or thodox views on Islam, first reared its ugly head in the country in 1995, when a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul VI, due to visit Manila once more (the first visit had been in 1981) was discovered in advertently. The plotters were a Middle Eastern group led by a Pakistani militant Abdul Hakim Murad and Kuwait-born Ramzi Youssef. The apartment the men had rented was in Ermita, a to urist district of Manila, only 200 yards away from the Vatican embassy. The place caught fire and in the subsequent search of the place the police discovered papers and computer disks that revealed not just the plot to kill the pope but to plant bombs on U. S. airlines flying out of Manila and other Asian cities and have them detonate in mid-flight. Youssef, it turned out, had been one of the planners of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, when a van packed with explosives detonated in one of the to wers’ underground parking lots. In 1995, he was arrested in Islamabad in Pakistan, tried and convicted in Manhattan’s federal courts, and sentenced to 240 years in prison. The plot, code-named Project Bojinka (which means “loud explosion” in Arabic) in cluded hijacking airliners and crashing them into key structures in the U. S. Among those identified were the World Trade Center, the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the Sears Tower in Chicago. A trial run had in fact been conducted when Youssef boarded a 1994 Tokyo-bound Philippine Airlines flight out of Manila, hid a small bomb underneath a passenger seat, then deplaned at a stopover in Cebu. En route to Tokyo, the bomb exploded, killing a Japanese to urist, and for cing the plane to land in Okinawa. Murad, subsequent in vestigations determined, had taken flying lessons in aviation schools in the United States, earning a commercial pilot certificate in 1992. He was convicted for his part in Operation Bojinka. Philippine authorities passed this in for mation on to the U. S. Embassy in Manila and to the U. S. Joint Task force on Terrorism. Instead of envisioning a similar scenario playing out at domestic U. S. airports and tightening security that might conceivably have foiled the September 11, 2001 tragedy, U. S. authorities in stead demanded extra security precautions at Asian cities where U. S.-bound flights or iginated. On that grim morning, four passenger jets on U. S. domestic flights were hijacked by terrorists from the Islamic fundamentalist group, Al Qaeda: kamikaze-style, two were crashed into the World Trade Center to wers, collapsing them and taking close to 3,000 lives; one jet was flown into the Pentagon, seriously damaging it; and the fourth airliner crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers put up a fight. As for the CPP and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, though the guerrilla force had dwindled to approximately 6,000 fighters by the time Aquino’s term had ended, it experienced a resurgence in the mid 1990 s, the ranks estimated to have grown to 12,000 fighters by the beginning of the second millennium. Patricio Abinales and Donna Amoroso in State and Society in the Philippines at tribute the resurgence to “deepening rural poverty and in creased migration of poor lowlanders to mountainous areas.” They point out another reason: the Philippine military assigning a majority of its fighting units to Mindanao, to engage the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf Group, thus leaving fewer troops to deal with the NPA.

Undoubtedly, the U. S. emphasis on combating Islamic fundamentalism, combined with its traditional role as patron, in fluenced the overall strategy. Dancing the Cha-Cha Energized by his supporters and by a business community that viewed approvingly the political stability and sustained economic recovery, with the in evitable comparison with Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew, to wards the end of his six-year term, Ramos sought to change the one-term limit as mandated by the Constitution. A movement was quickly created, the People’s Initiative for Reform, Modern ization, and Action, or PIRMA, its acronym a clever play on the Tagalog word meaning “to sign.” The aim was to get enough signatures for a referendum on a constitutional convention. Ramos’s move for charter change through such a convention was quickly dubbed “Cha-Cha.” Powerful elements reacted quickly. Top Catholic bishops came out with a pastoral letter voicing their opposition. And ex-president Cory Aquino spoke impassionedly to a crowd of 200,000 at a rally meant to signal Ramos that the public wouldn’t stand for any extension of his or anyone’s term. With the memory of Marcos’s disastrous at tempts to perpetuate himself in power still fresh in the collective memory, the move by Ramos supporters for constitutional change fizzled out. Chastened, President Ramos pledged not to endeavor amending the constitution and to ensure a peaceful transfer of power in 1998, when the next round of national elections were to be held. Ramos and the governing party Lakas ng Tao, or People Power, backed House Speaker José de Venecia for the presidency and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the daughter of the for mer president Diosdado Macapagal, for the vice presidency. The opposition candidates were Ramos’s vice president Joseph Estrada; Senator Raul Roco; Secretary of Defense Renato de Villa; Juan Ponce Enrile; Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago; and Imelda Marcos. (In 1993, given permission by the Ramos government, the dictator’s widow had flown back from Honolulu with the body of her late husband, who had finally succumbed to the ravages of his long-term illness in September of 1989. To prevent a loyalist mob scene in Manila, the government or dered the plane to fly directly to Laoag City, in the heavily pro-Marcos Ilocos region in northern Luzon.) Once again, elections were held for all 17,200 elective positions in May of 1998. This time, the number of candidates exceeded 100,000—an average of almost six people competing for every position. For the highest of fice in the land, eighty-three in dividuals in itially filed for certification from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), in cluding a certain Mario Legazpi, who declared that he had descended from heaven to assume the presidency. The Commission weeded out all those unqualified, reducing the presidential field to seven candidates, in cluding Vice President Estrada and Imelda Marcos. Presumably, Legazpi ascended to his ethereal home, sorely disappointed at the less than worshipful reception he had gotten on Earth. But Ferdinand’s widow was for ced to drop out due to a conviction on charges of graft, which she was appealing, and which was subsequently overturned in 1998, after the elections. * Her loyalist bloc swung their votes in favor of Estrada, and Marcos-era cronies such as Eduardo Cojuangco and the to bacco tycoon Lucio Tan, both of whom had deep pockets, endorsed him. Estrada managed to garner limited support from the left, as he had voted against the ratification of the bases’ treaty in 1991—and had even produced and starred in an anti-bases film. He won with forty percent of the vote, with his nearest rival de Venecia garnering only 15 percent—the largest margin of victory in free Philippine elections. Estrada had been propelled to of fice by the urban poor and the disenfranchised, whose imagination he had captured by picturing himself as their savior. T HE B IGGEST R OLE OF H IS C AREER He was—and is—known to the public as Erap (from the Tagalog word pare, or buddy, spelled backwards). “Erap para sa Mahirap” (“Erap for the Poor”) was the catchy slogan President Joseph Estrada (1998-2000) used during his successful campaign, building on the cinematic portrait of himself as a death- defying proletarian action-star who always won in his crusade against evildoers, the main reason President Ramos had appointed him his crime czar. His campaign brilliantly capitalized on his well-known tendency to fracture English and commit linguistic malapropisms to stress his common-man qualities, releasing a collection of his unintentionally humorous use of English, Eraptions: How to Speak English Without Really Trial. (Sample: annoyed on one occasion by the fact that his listener couldn’t understand his English, Estrada was said to have remarked: “From now on, I will speak in the binocular!”) It made it easier for the common tao to identify with him; he was the sort of fellow folks would love to have a beer with. The fact that he had been a movie star gave him a tremendous advantage at the in numerable de rigueur campaign rallies all over the archipelago. Not only did he speak the earthy language of the masa (or masses), he could at tract top-drawer names from the entertainment world to wow the crowds. None had more star power than a close friend of his, Fernando Poe, Jr., the king of action cinema and an even bigger star than Estrada. As expected, he endorsed Estrada. He himself would run unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2004"

He himself would run unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2004. In fact, Estrada may have had pedestrian tastes but was decidedly un- proletarian, being from a solidly bourgeois family from San Juan, a relatively affluent municipality that was part of Metro Manila and where the shots that ignited the brutal 1899 Philippine-American War had been fired. He had at tended private schools, in cluding the exclusive all-male Ateneo de Manila High School, from which he was expelled for fighting. Later, he dropped out from the college where he had enrolled for an engineering degree, to pursue a career in film and quickly became a star, one who combined the derring-do of James Bond with a social conscience. Once he retired from the movies, he served as mayor of his hometown for seventeen years, before winning a Senate seat in 1987, and the vice-presidency in 1992. New Political Groupings By 1998, the political landscape had changed significantly. Along with Estrada, for the first time, following the mandate of the 1987 Constitution, 13 party-list representatives were elected, out of a potential 52. As briefly discussed in the previous chapter, the idea behind this new elective category, the party-list—a direct outcome of the 1986 People Power uprising—was to allow nongovernmental or ganizations to for mally represent the sectors that they worked with, such as the urban poor, women, and workers, traditionally with little in put in governance. In addition, there had arisen evangelical movements with popular followings among the working class and urban poor: El Shaddai and Jesus Is Lord. Both groups were capable of or ganizing huge rallies and, through endorsements, mobilizing their respective followers to back a particular candidate. These popular movements were well within the grassroots tradition of folk Christianity dating back to the Spanish colonial era—reminiscent of, for in stance, the populist Christianity espoused in mid nineteenth century by Apolinario de la Cruz (discussed in Chapter Three) and his Cofradía, who felt the Church hierarchy was too devoted to the Spanish and pro-Spanish native elite, the reby ignoring the particular circumstances of folk Catholicism as practiced by the majority of Filipinos in less circumscribed and in stitutionalized procedures. The gap between the social elites and the masses were in some ways reflected in the gap between the church hierarchs and affluent congregations on one hand and grassroots clerics and their poorer flocks, on the other hand. Nevertheless, as to be expected, the Catholic Church retained its considerable political clout, as did the Iglesia ni Kristo (INK, or Church of Christ) whose voters among its more than 2 million members vote as a bloc according to guidelines laid down by the church leadership. Hence, the INK, dominated by the Manalo family since its founding in 1914 by family patriarch Felix Manalo, was always courted by the political establishment. In contrast is the older nationalist Independiente Filipina Iglesia (IFI), the Independent Philippine Church, better known as the Aglipayan church, discussed in chapter four. With a majority of its congregation based in the Ilocos region, the IFI retains its nationalist, anti-imperialist leanings, and is in communion with the Episcopalian church as well as with the Old Catholics. Aglipayans are of ten viewed as troublesome anti-government activists. Its Chief Bishop, Alberto Ramento, a vocal critic of the Arroyo government, was killed in 2007 by, it was suspected, a pro-government death squad. Other clear in dications of deep-seated voter dissatisfaction with the trapos, or traditional politicians, were made evident when a number of celebrities from the entertainment, sports, and media worlds, undoubtedly encouraged by Estrada’s success, ran for political of fice, with many winning. Thus, for example, Robert Jaworski, a hugely popular professional basketball star; Ramon Revilla, a silver- screen action hero in the same mold as Estrada though not as popular; and Vic “Tito” Sotto, a well-known television personality, gained seats in the Senate. (A beloved comedian Dolphy was encouraged to run but refused. Asked why, he replied with a straight face, “I might win.”) Grown disenchanted, the voters sought fresh faces. At the same time, the faces had to be familiar ones, of figures who had risen to prominence outside the conventional political processes that had churned out society’s leaders. There were more than enough stars in the movies, sports, and media who met this criterion and only too willing to meet this need. The MILF The Ramos government and the 12,000-strong MNLF having reached an agreement in 1996 to set up ARMM, the AFP turned its at tention to the MILF. The Ramos administration had agreed to a truce with the MILF in 1997, and had set up peace talks. But encounters still took place between the rebels and the army. In early 2000, with President Estrada’s blessing, the army rejected the truce and launched what it termed an “all-out war” on thirteen MILF camps in Mindanao, renewing armed conflict on the island. At the same time, it took over the island of Jolo in its pursuit of the ASG, leading to more encounters. In an event that made newspaper headlines, Estrada flew to the stronghold of the MILF in central Mindanao, Camp Abu Bakar, once it had been overran by the army, and celebrated with the troops by eating roast pig—a deliberate, provocative act that was seen as an in sult to all Muslims. The MILF head Hashim Salamat fled to Malaysia and declared a jihad against the Philippine government. Warrants for his arrest were issued, and a reward for his capture of fered. A ceasefire was agreed to under the new government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and talks were once again resumed in 2001. The warrants were suspended, and Salamat returned to Mindanao.

A ceasefire was agreed to under the new government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and talks were once again resumed in 2001. The warrants were suspended, and Salamat returned to Mindanao. Not surprisingly, the talks stalled the same year. A key demand of the government was for the MILF to renounce terrorism, which Salamat did in mid 2003. Shortly after, the founder of the MILF died in Lanao del Sur Province, with its military commander Al Haj Murad emerging as the new chair. In a move that once again drew the U. S. military into this complicated picture, in 1998, the Estrada government and the United States had drawn up the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which the Senate ratified in 1999. For the first time since the termination of the bases treaty in 1992, U. S. troops were allowed into the country along with vessels and aircraft. Like the old bases treaty, the VFA reserved the right of jurisdiction over U. S military personnel to U. S. military authorities for purported crimes, unless such crimes were deemed to be of special significance to the Philippines. What that meant in practice was that it would still be difficult to prosecute a U. S. serviceman under Philippine law. The VFA provided an opening which would widen considerably in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, when Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had already succeeded Estrada as president. E RAP’S D OWNFALL Erap proved to be less than assiduous in his devotion to the mahirap. For the electorate, it was déjà vu, since corruption during his brief tenure stemmed largely, à la Marcos, from vulnerability to his family and cronies. Relying on friendships built over the years, over nights of carousing and drinking, his friends easily got presidential approval for loans, lucrative deals and government contracts. These friends got to be known as Estrada’s Midnight Cabinet—in truth a reprise of the barkada system, a barkada being a tightly knit circle of close friends who knew each other from their salad days and whose loyalty to one another was almost as strong as family ties. One never said No to either the barkada or the family. Estrada was thus as easily in fluenced by his close-knit barkada as by his kin. Was he in fact the second coming of Marcos? While Estrada used public of fice for enrichment for himself, his family, and his barkada, the cronyism was not as devastating to the economy as it had been under Marcos, when the in dividuals in volved were experienced players in business and in ternational finance, and the sums much larger. Too, Estrada’s time in of fice was short, two and a half years, compared to the two decades that the Marcoses had been in power. No doubt encouraged by her friendship with Estrada and by his style of personal governance—something she could relate to—Imelda Marcos announced to the world that she was determined to recover $12 billion in assets her late husband and she owned. She had dropped this bombshell in response to the on going struggle—began during Aquino’s term—over who actually owned and controlled San Miguel Corporation, the country’s largest business enterprise and responsible for 4 percent of GDP, and 6 percent of tax revenues. She was miffed by supposedly ungrateful cronies who she claimed were given large amounts of money by her late husband to acquire companies on his behalf. Imelda declared, “This was in the 1970 s. Now they want to hold on to wealth they did not own in the first place.” She defiantly told the press, “We own practically everything in the country.” This was in deed a dramatic turnaround from when her defense lawyer proclaimed during her 1990 New York trial that she was really a poor girl who relied on the kindness of strangers. (The 1990 trial was the first time she had publicly and reluctantly allowed that her upbringing was less than privileged.) Knowing that President Estrada was sympathetic to the Marcoses, Imelda also sought to have Ferdinand in terred at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani, or National Heroes Cemetery, the Philippine equivalent of the Arlington National Cemetery. Estrada in dicated that he was of a mind to approve her request but the firestorm of protest that erupted for ced him to back down. Imelda and the Marcos loyalists had to content the mselves with the display of the late dictator’s embalmed corpse in a mausoleum located in Batac, Ilocos Norte, open to the public. But what proved to be fatally damaging to his presidency were revelations made in mid-October 2000 by the governor of Ilocos Sur, Luis “Chavit” Singson, a friend and fellow gambler. Governor Singson had collected more than $20 million in bribes from illegal gambling syndicates that operated a numbers game, popular throughout the country, known as jueteng, bribes that he then claimed to have passed on to the president. Singson said he had made these revelations to protect himself, alleging that the president (or the president’s men) had made not just threats on his life but that in the wee hours of October 9, 2000, policemen had surrounded him and his bodyguards in his bulletproof Chevrolet Suburban. Nothing came of the confrontation and Singson lived to tell tales out of school. Other sordid revelations followed: siphoning money from national lottery funds in tended for charities, and from to bacco taxes. Newspaper accounts provided details of how the money was spent to support the lifestyles of Estrada’s different mistresses and their of fspring, in cluding the construction of expensive residences and the purchase of luxury vehicles. Estrada himself seemed unapologetic for his penchant for high living. During his campaign for the presidency he made no secret of his amorous life; it may even have boosted his popularity"

But what proved to be fatally damaging to his presidency were revelations made in mid-October 2000 by the governor of Ilocos Sur, Luis “Chavit” Singson, a friend and fellow gambler. Governor Singson had collected more than $20 million in bribes from illegal gambling syndicates that operated a numbers game, popular throughout the country, known as jueteng, bribes that he then claimed to have passed on to the president. Singson said he had made these revelations to protect himself, alleging that the president (or the president’s men) had made not just threats on his life but that in the wee hours of October 9, 2000, policemen had surrounded him and his bodyguards in his bulletproof Chevrolet Suburban. Nothing came of the confrontation and Singson lived to tell tales out of school. Other sordid revelations followed: siphoning money from national lottery funds in tended for charities, and from to bacco taxes. Newspaper accounts provided details of how the money was spent to support the lifestyles of Estrada’s different mistresses and their of fspring, in cluding the construction of expensive residences and the purchase of luxury vehicles. Estrada himself seemed unapologetic for his penchant for high living. During his campaign for the presidency he made no secret of his amorous life; it may even have boosted his popularity. Media reports revealed that the president had at least three known mistresses, with each getting a mansion, and only in wealthy neighborhoods such as Forbes Park, the most exclusive enclave in the country. One home cost the equivalent of $4 million. Another palatial residence, a 7,400-square-meter property, was nicknamed “Boracay,” after an island in the south famed for its sugary white beaches. Some of the island’s fine sand had been flown in to create a mini-beach by the residence’s gargantuan swimming pool that came with a wave-making device. The obvious question of course was, where did all the money come from? Investigative reports, principally from the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, portrayed a sordid network of kickbacks, commissions from jueteng, and the use of government funds (principally from Social Security and the Government Service Insurance System) to purchase shares in or acquire private corporations. Impeachment proceedings against President Estrada began on November 13, 2000, when the House of Representatives approved and passed a motion on to the Senate for Estrada’s removal. Less than a month later, on December 7, the Senate opened impeachment hearings against the president, citing a long list of bribery and corruption charges. A turning point was reached on December 20, when an in vestigation began into a particular bank account with the Philippines third-largest bank, Equitable PCI. Apparently, a check for $2.8 million had been issued in the name of José Velarde. Prosecutors alleged that Velarde was a nom de plume of Estrada’s. A bank clerk came for ward to testify that she saw the president sign the check. The bank—itself the merger of two banks or chestrated by Estrada cronies—was believed to be the repository where at least $2.2 billion was alleged by government prosecutors to have been deposited between August 1999 (when the Velarde account was opened) and January 2000. But Estrada partisans had the majority in the Senate. By early January 2001, the televised impeachment trial was stopped in its tracks when the senators voted 11 to 10 not to open bank records that would have allegedly provided the smoking gun and thus in criminate the president. One pro-Estrada senator, Teresa Aquino Oreta (the sister of the slain Ninoy Aquino), was caught on camera doing an impromptu jig, an image that helped to in flame anti-Estrada protests in Metro Manila. The citizenry took to the streets in a reprise of People Power, quickly nicknamed “EDSA Dos,” or EDSA Two, demanding Estrada’s resignation. (EDSA stands for Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, Metro Manila’s major thoroughfare, and the site for the People Power uprising of 1986.) The number of protesters swelled to a million, and on January 19, a chorus of military and church leaders declared their support for Vice President Arroyo to take over as president. The embattled Estrada called out his own followers (a large number of whom were Marcos loyalists) in a counterrally, “EDSA Tres” (EDSA Three), but to no effect. On January 20, 2001, the Armed Forces of the Philippines for mally with drew its backing for Erap. The Supreme Court ruled that the presidency was now vacant, and Macapagal Arroyo was sworn in as president that same day. Charging that it was a coup since he had been constitutionally elected, Estrada and his family were for ced to abandon Malacañang. Arrested and for mally accused of plunder in April of 2001, Estrada was in detention for six years, for most of that period not at any common jail or military stockade but at his rather luxurious vacation home—complete with the ater, gym, and library—in a hilly suburb of Manila. After in numerable procedural delays, and testimony by a variety of witnesses, on September 12, 2007, the for mer president was found guilty of the crime of plunder by an anti-corruption court in Manila, and sentenced to forty years in prison. Estrada was or dered to pay the government $15.6 million and for feit a home he had built for a mistress— presumably funded by ill-gotten money. Prosecutors had charged him with being paid $85 million in kickbacks from to bacco taxes, commissions from both the illegal purchase of shares in private firms with government in surance funds and from jueteng—the various payoffs being deposited at the bank that figured prominently in the failed impeachment trial. A little more than a month after his conviction, on October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo pardoned the disgraced for mer president on condition that he not run again for national of fice.

De Venecia lost but Macapagal Arroyo won. Estrada appointed her secretary of social welfare and development. Since she hadn’t been elected to the presidency, the constitutional one-term limit did not apply to her. Nevertheless, in 2002, Macapagal Arroyo stated that she wouldn’t seek a second term as president, causing a dramatic surge in her approval ratings. Pressured by her advisers and family and friends, it wasn’t too long, however, before she reneged on her word and declared that she would in deed seek a second term come the 2004 elections. Her main rival was Fernando Poe Jr. a close friend of Estrada whom he had endorsed in the last elections, and, as noted, was an even bigger star. It didn’t hurt that his wife was Susan Roces, a for mer movie star herself, the reigning celluloid queen in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s. While the iconic film hero’s immense popularity meant an early lead in the polls, Poe lacked the campaign machinery, the political experience, and media know-how that Macapagal Arroyo had. Amidst protestations of poll irregularities, the in cumbent was declared winner of the 2004 elections. Hello Garci, Goodbye, Gloria—Almost Allegations that GMA had had the electoral tally rigged—or in popular slang, subjected to dagdag, bawas, or additions and subtractions surreptitiously done to in fluence the outcome—gained traction when wiretapped conversations surfaced in mid 2005, between a woman widely presumed to be the president and a man widely believed to be COMELEC Commissioner Virgilio Garcilano. Between May 26, 2004 and June 10, 2004, there were fifteen phone calls altogether. The subject was the electoral count. The exchanges had taken place after the voting was over but before a winner had been declared, and reflected two concerns: one, that the margin of victory be more than 1 million; and two, that the electoral tallies from the of ficial certificates of canvass (a summary of votes from each region) and from the statements of votes from each of a region’s precints, when added up, would not match as they were supposed to. The conversations were promptly dubbed the “Hello Garci” tapes” by the media, and the ring tone that could be heard on the tapes became commercially popular. The caller expressed particular concern about the tallies from southern Mindanao, given that there were reports in the media of irregularities there. A Hadji Abdullah Dalidig, head of NAMFREL in the province of Lanao del Sur, declared, for in stance, that the 2004 elections were “the worst and dirtiest” of the five elections he had monitored in the province. “What was done to the votes at the presidential level, even grade one schoolchildren would know the votes of the other candidates were sabotaged.” In the nearby province of Maguindanao, the governor Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the entrenched political clan, the Ampatuans, and a close political ally of President Macapagal Arroyo, guaranteed that his bailiwick would go for her. He was so good at keeping his word that in two to wns there were zero votes for the movie superstar turned presidential candidate, Fernando Poe, Jr. Both the House and Senate demanded an in vestigation; there were calls for Arroyo’s resignation. A motion for impeachment was filed but got nowhere. The president refused to step down, though she did admit talking to a COMELEC of ficial during the canvassing period. She conceded that it was a “lapse in judgment.” However, she emphasized that the conversations occurred after the votes had been counted. Nor did she name the of ficial in volved. Once the scandal broke, Garcillano dropped from public view; there were sightings of him in various places, even abroad. More than five months later, he surfaced and admitted that he had conversed with President Arroyo during the canvassing period, and, as she had stated, after the votes had been tallied. He denied that the president had asked him to rig the count in her favor. The calls were unseemly, and the probability that Arroyo had in terfered with the 2004 elections led to the resignation in July 2005 of eight cabinet members and two bureau heads— dubbed “the Hyatt 10” for having announced their decision at the Manila Hyatt hotel. The group asked the president to resign, pointing out in a prepared statement that “resignation is a legitimate constitutional option for effecting leadership change.” That call was renewed in 2009, on the fourth anniversary of the group’s mass resignation, with its members now adding the charge that the president was seeking to stay in power beyond the constitutional limit, either by declaring a state of emergency or through charter change—the same possibility that President Ramos had tentatively explored—and that was once again being proposed. Other scandals mainly in volving corruption plagued Arroyo’s administration, with one in particular eroding its credibility further. In April 2007, the Philippine government and a Chinese firm, ZTE, agreed on a $329.5 million contract for a national broadband network. Soon after, allegations were made about kickbacks from ZTE in volving Benjamin Abalos, the new chair of COMELEC, and the president’s husband, Mike Arroyo. The allegations were credible enough for the Supreme Court in September 2007 to issue a temporary restraining or der, freezing the deal. Due to the political brouhaha and threatened in vestigations by Congress, President Arroyo cancelled the contract in October of the same year. Complicating the entire matter was the claim of a mid-level government of ficial, Rodolfo Lozada, who declared in different public fora that in deed the president’s husband and the COMELEC chair were behind the kickback scheme—charges both parties were quick to deny.

Among those demanding her ouster were for mer presidents Aquino and Estrada; in the latter’s case, it was clearly payback for his peremptory removal from of fice, even though Arroyo had pardoned him. People called for the president to step down at public rallies; there were hopes for another massive outpouring of citizens onto the streets—a reprise of the 1986 People Power phenomenon— to force her resignation. None materialized, however. One reason was that Arroyo’s vice president Noli de Castro, for merly a well-known broadcast anchor, was on no one’s list as a plausible alternative. For another, the flamboyant the ater of the streets had ultimately proved to be disappointing as a way of effecting fundamental change —the current president herself being proof of this axiom—and the population had become understandably wary of going this route once more. Q UO V ADIS, P HILIPPINES? The Global War on Terror Since 2001, the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s record on human rights has led critics to compare her government to that of Ferdinand Marcos. A major reason for the deterioration of the state of human rights that had been restored so dramatically during Cory Aquino’s tenure came from the alignment, in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, of Philippine government policies with those of U. S. President George W. Bush that came to be labeled the “Global War on Terror.” Eight days after the collapse of the World Trade Center to wers, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo became the first Asian leader to endorse the Bush administration’s global war on terrorism. By doing so, she in ternationalized her country’s two in surgencies, recasting these as terrorist threats to an ill-defined world or der. None of the in surgencies, past or present, that the AFP had faced since the country regained its in dependence in 1946, were ever viewed by Manila as more than in ternal, albeit serious, threats. However, as detailed in previous chapters, any serious domestic challenge to the Philippine government, such as the Huk in surgency in the 1950 s, was in variably seen by the U. S. as a threat to its own in terests, mainly to its bases in the country, for which Washington extended economic and military aid to Manila and guaranteed U. S. in terference in Philippine affairs. Through the war on terror, the country was thus once again able to tap into U. S. aid, reduced substantially since the closing of the bases in 1992, and facilitated the revival of U. S. proprietary aims on the archipelago. By February 2002, U. S. troops had been deployed in the islands for a series of joint exercises with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), dubbed Balikatan, or Shoulder-to-Shoulder—apparently in violation of the Philippine Constitution, which prohibits the presence of for eign troops in the country but which the government contended was allowed by the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998. At the outset of these joint exercises, the Bush government promised the Philippines $100 million in mostly military aid. For the peace talks between Manila and the MILF, U. S. Congress earmarked $30 million in 2003, while USAID promised $20 million for the following year. Arroyo’s enthusiastic support for Bush’s war, while embarrassing to nationalists, was unsurprising, and was in keeping with how Philippine leaders have traditionally used the country’s strategic location in Southeast Asia as a bargaining chip, extracting economic and military aid from the United States, which has always viewed the Philippines as crucial to maintaining both its regional and global hegemony—and of containing China, a prize sought during the heyday of empire, but now a superpower rival. Two other factors in creased the Philippines’ strategic value: a possible U. S. confrontation with North Korea as it sought to develop nuclear weapons, and the Philippines’ claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines, surrounded by rich fishing grounds, and thought to contain enormous reserves of oil and gas, this desolate stretch of tiny isles and coral reefs is being claimed as well by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Borneo, and Malaysia, either in part or in its entirety. Dispersed over 410,000 square kilometers, this patch of ocean may yet be a flashpoint between China and the U. S., with the Philippines as an American surrogate. For now, there is an uneasy détente, with the rival claimants for swearing the use of force to resolve disputes. U. S. troop presence in Mindanao was of course an iffy proposition, since memories of the campaign to pacify Mindanao during the 1899 Philippine- American War remained vivid, particularly of at rocities committed by American troops, such as the 1906 massacre of 600 largely defenseless Muslim men, women, and children in Bud Dajo. And unlike their Christian counterparts elsewhere in Mindanao and in the country, Moros identified more with the Middle East than with the United States. Nevertheless, its troops were welcomed to the island of Basilan, which had a fairly large Christian community, since the in itial target of this Balikatan exercise was the Abu Sayyaf, and Basilan was a stronghold of the gang. For the U. S., fighting the ASG bolstered its claim to be waging and winning the war against terrorism. It was widely believed that the local military units in pursuit of the Abu Sayyaf were on the gang’s payroll— enabling the ASG to conveniently elude the military just when they were about to close in. If it took U. S. in volvement to rid the island of the ASG scourge, so be it. People were simply sick and tired of the gang"

The tragedy of 9/11 allowed both governments a way of exploiting other ends —one regional and global, the other, local—seeming to play the role of avenging angels while reprising their roles as colonizer and colonized. Under the 2002 Mutual Logistics Supply Agreement (MLSA) between the two governments, the Pentagon could once again use the archipelago as a springboard for in tervention —euphemistically termed “stability operations.” The MLSA granted U. S. for ces access to Philippine military facilities throughout the country, converting the whole archipelago into a virtual base for the Pentagon, with out being tied down to fixed sites, as had been the case with Clark and Subic, that would otherwise leave the U. S. open once again to charges of permanent tenure. The 2002 agreement also allowed storage and stockpiling facilities for U. S. troops, as well as the construction of “temporary” buildings, all of which critics charged was a violation of the 1987 constitution, which requires that the building of “for eign military facilities” in addition to “for eign military troops and bases” be ratified by the Senate. The 1999 VFA and the 2002 MLSA allowed the United States military to broaden the scope of its activities, in cluding U. S. troops accompanying Filipino soldiers into combat or conflict areas. A U. S. embassy spokesman in Manila explained that the troops were “not in volved in any combat roles but will fire back if fired upon…. Our role is to advise and assist the Philippine military.” The danger, of course, was that these advisers could be drawn into combat, and wind up in a Vietnam-style quagmire. The Mindanao Conflict With the establishment in 1996 of ARMM, and Misuari as ARMM governor, the MNLF ceased for the most part to be a threat. But that peace between the AFP and MNLF was disrupted when in November 2001, Misuari engineered an armed uprising against the for mer. Elections to replace him as governor of ARMM were scheduled for later in the month. His followers at tacked the army headquarters in Jolo, the largest of the Sulu islands. The at tack failed, however, and Misuari with some of his aides fled to Malaysia. There, much to his unpleasant surprise and in contrast with the sanctuary he was accorded in the 1970 s during the Marcos regime, he was arrested, extradited to Manila, and imprisoned in a military stockade. In February 2005, supporters loyal to Misuari launched a series of assaults on army troops in Jolo. The trigger for the violence was thought to be the start of a huge military operation against the Abu Sayyaf. While the assaults were repulsed, they sent an unmistakable signal that the deposed ARMM governor and ex-head of the MNLF still had a significant following. Today, the AFP continues to face the NPA nation-wide, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao—and to a lesser extent the Abu Sayyaf Group. Reliable estimates put the strength of each guerrilla army at between 12,000 to 15,000 men under arms, while the ASG is believed to number no more than 400 armed men. The MILF, with more emphasis on its Islamic roots than the MNLF and based in central Mindanao, has broad popular support in rural areas where the historic lack of economic development has encouraged armed dissent. In 2000, as ment ioned earlier in this chapter, the army under then- president Joseph Estrada launched a crackdown on the MILF, leading to a renewal of armed conflict. The two sides signed a peace deal in 2001, but violent in terludes seem to alternate with periods of relative peace. In February 2003, the Philippine military accused the MILF of harboring members of the small but militant Pentagon kidnap gang, yet another “lost command” group accused of abducting for eigners for ransom, and launched a new of fensive. The MILF denied providing sanctuary to Pentagon members. It also denied being behind a bomb blast at Davao City Airport in March 2003, that killed 21 people. Both the U. S. and the Philippine governments also suspected the MILF of having ties with fundamentalist groups such as Jemah Islamiyah in Indonesia, held responsible for deadly bombings on Bali in 2002 and 2005, links the MILF denied having. Still, neither the U. S. nor the Philippine government had branded the group as terrorist—allowing the Philippine government to hold talks with the group in Malaysia, with tacit U. S. support. (In contrast, in 2002, the Bush administration designated the NPA a terrorist group even though everyone acknowledged that it had no ties to any for eign terrorist or ganization.) The truth was somewhere between: given the history shared by MILF and other Southeast Asian mujahideen in fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, and porous southern sea borders between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, ad hoc ties but no for mal arrangements probably existed between the different groups. Shortly before his death from a heart at tack in July 2003, MILF head Salamat Hashim issued a statement renouncing terrorism and underlining the MILF’s commitment to achieving a peace settlement. A ceasefire was agreed upon, and both sides returned to the bargaining table. In mid 2008, the Philippine government and the MILF drafted a potentially significant Memorandum of Agreement concerning the so-called ancestral domain of the Muslims. The lands alluded to were to be made up of the ARMM provinces, plus specified to wns and geographic areas in three other Mindanao provinces.

The lands alluded to were to be made up of the ARMM provinces, plus specified to wns and geographic areas in three other Mindanao provinces. The effect would be to add 712 to wns to the existing Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Subject to a plebiscite, the designated territory, the Bangsamoro Homeland, would not be under the jurisdiction of the central government but would in stead be ruled by the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity. The proposed expansion led to protests among predominantly Christian villages that would have become part of ARMM, resulting in a legal challenge to the proposed agreement. Prior to the for mal signing between the MILF and Philippine government of ficials in Malaysia, the Philippine Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining or der that froze the agreement and led to the cancellation of the signing ceremony. As feared, the setback led to a violent backlash, with MILF and army units clashing in central Mindanao in August 2008, with at least thirty fatalities. Accused of political in sensitivity, the central government stepped back from the proposed deal and said that it would seek a way to accommodate MILF demands through another mechanism. What that mechanism might be was never specified. Nevertheless, another ceasefire was agreed to in late July of 2009, leading to a revival of peace talks. The NPA Rebounds The focus on the MILF obscured the on going, by 2009, forty-year-old conflict with the NPA, even as the guerrilla army stepped up its at tacks on army and police units. From its peak of at least 25,000 armed regulars in the waning years of the Marcos regime, the NPA, as stated previously, had declined by 1994 to 6,000, and at the beginning of the second millennium, had climbed back to more than 12,000 strong. It remained a palpable presence in rural areas, where poverty seemed to be, as it had always been, a permanent feature of the landscape. Too, it and its political base, the Communist Party of the Philippines, were no longer plagued by the in ternecine and bloody struggles of the late 1980 s. Like those with the Muslim in surgents, talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF)—representing the CPP (whose founder, José Maria Sison, has lived in exile at The Hague in the Netherlands since 1987) and the NPA—have occurred in fits and starts since the late 1980 s. Complicating matters was the fact that in August 2002, the U. S. labeled the NPA a terrorist or ganization, with the European Union following suit in 2004, even though Washington never linked the NPA to any for eign group. The NDF broke off the talks and demanded that the label be with drawn. Sison was put on the terrorist list as well, arrested by Dutch police in August 2007, and charged with or dering three assassinations in the Philippines. He was then or dered released by the Dutch courts while in vestigations into the allegations were being pursued. The Arroyo government, for its part, has not labeled the NPA a terrorist group, and even though for mal talks had stalled, engaged the NDF in in for mal sessions. Up until the resumption of for mal talks in the Norwegian capital of Oslo in 2009, the two sides in principle had agreed to certain steps that would move to wards a for mal peace deal. These steps would in clude setting up a joint commission to examine human rights abuses on both sides, and working to gether for the removal of the NPA, and of Sison, from the U. S. and the EU’s list of terrorist or ganizations. In late September of 2009, Sison’s name was struck from the list of terrorists, paving the way for the resumption of peace talks. Keeping the AFP in Line Playing subaltern to the United States in the war on terrorism also enables the Philippine military to push its own agenda to the for efront. Under Marcos, the size of the AFP had in creased dramatically, from 50,000 to 274,000 (in cluding a paramilitary force of 65,000). With the ouster of the dictator and his shoe-loving wife Imelda in 1986, and with the corresponding decline in U. S. military aid once the bases treaty had been rejected by the Philippine Senate in 1992, the AFP’s size was whittled down to 127,000. In 2004 its budget for its army, air force, and navy was less than $1 billion, hardly adequate given the decrepit state of much of its equipment, from aging M-14 and M-16 rifles to outmoded fighter planes. Wages were raised but not nearly enough. Grunts and lower-level of ficers had a litany of complaints, ranging from meager meal allowances to in adequate clothing and faulty weaponry. It seems that it isn’t tactical in telligence or for eign advisers the AFP needs but sweeping reforms. One factor that saps morale above all is that of financial hijinks at the top. A 2001 study of military corruption conducted by the nonprofit Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, found that as much as 30 to 50 percent of military funds goes to kickbacks. Widespread malfeasance in high places was in fact one of the major charges leveled against the government by the group of 350 mutinous soldiers, led by junior-grade of ficers, in the earlier- ment ioned failed coup at tempt of July 27, 2003. Having failed to in spire mass defections from the ranks and an outpouring of civilians onto the streets to protect them, as was the case in the 1986 “people power” uprising against Marcos, the at tempt fizzled, and the of ficers arrested. The of ficers accused their superiors of making money at the expense of the rank and file, by selling government weapons to their enemies and of or chestrating bombings in Mindanao—acts which had been blamed on the MILF but which the MILF refuted—in or der to receive anti-terrorist funds from the U. S. While the putsch was universally condemned, the of ficers’ allegations drew widespread sympathy. Even AFP of ficials admitted to corruption in their ranks"

S. While the putsch was universally condemned, the of ficers’ allegations drew widespread sympathy. Even AFP of ficials admitted to corruption in their ranks. In perhaps the most publicized in stance of corruption in the military, for mer AFP comptroller General Carlos Garcia was found guilty in February of 2009 by a Manila court of perjury in misdeclaring his assets in 2000, which the prosecution contended amounted to more than P 300 million, or approximately $6 million, a princely sum for an of ficer in a service that notoriously underpays its men. In addition, two of his sons were in dicted in the U. S. for smuggling $100,00 in cash into the country in 2003. As one local journalist put it, waging war and getting money from the U. S. “is an in dustry.” In the post-Marcos era, a politicized and demoralized AFP represents a greater threat to the government than either the MILF or the NPA, as shown by the number of coup at tempts since 1986, the last two being the July 2003 coup at tempt and another one in February of 2006, which shook Arroyo, especially as she had assiduously cultivated her relationship with the military—and which led her to declare a weeklong state of emergency. There was a popular outcry against the decree, with critics denouncing it as a Marcos-era ploy, since the last coup at tempt fizzled out apparently even before it could be launched. The War on Terrorism Terrorizes The war on terrorism is as much one of words, centered on the label “terrorist.” It means, as a character in Alice in Wonderland would have it, anything its user chooses it to mean. Marcos always paired “communist” with “subversive,” to tar anyone who opposed his regime. Both the U. S. government and Arroyo, by their wholesale labeling blur the distinction between ideologically driven groups like the NPA and the MILF, with their military targets, and a criminal gang like the Abu Sayyaf, to whom Islam and its alleged association with Al Qaeda is simply a cover for mayhem. What have been the effects of war on terrorism in the Philippines? Rather than improve the lives of those directly affected, it has made them worse. The war itself, especially in Mindanao, with its roots in the Spanish colonial-era conflicts, can be regarded as terroristic. The number of in ternal refugees ebbs and flows, depending on the state of the on going war. Most military encampments lie in civilian areas, putting these residents in danger every time hostilities resume. And the economic costs to both the government and the farmers, workers, and small entrepreneurs have been staggering—from 1975 to 2002, P 5 billion to P 10 billion (roughly $100 to $200 million) were spent annually on the conflict, monies that could have gone to wards social services and in frastructure development in the country’s poorest provinces. A horrifying corollary of Philippine participation in the war on terrorism has been the rise of politically motivated killings in the country since 2001. According to Karapatan, an umbrella group for various Philippine human rights or ganizations, to wards the end of 2009, 1,118 men and women had been summarily executed—“salvaged”—under Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s government. There were 204 cases of desaparecidos, where no body was ever found, and 1,026 cases of to rture. Supposedly in compliance with Bush’s global war on terror, President Arroyo ratcheted up her government’s pressure on the Philippine left, reviving memories of the Marcos dictatorship and its dirty war against the opposition. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights First have criticized the Arroyo government for failing to prevent —and even abetting—such killings. A 2007 report to the UN General Assembly by Special Rapporteur Phillip Alston, based on a fact-finding visit in February of that same year, echoed such criticism. * Alston pointed to two underlying causes for the unchecked murders: the in discriminate labeling of left-wing groups as “front or ganizations” for “armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy,” and a government “counter-in surgency strategy” that encourages “the extrajudicial killings of activists and other ‘enemies’ in certain circumstances.” Even the 2006 government-appointed Melo Commission, created precisely to in vestigate the unexplained killings of activists and journalists, blamed rogue elements in the military for these salvagings, or extrajudicial murders. The Commission took pains to ment ion Major General Jovito Palparan, whom a number of human-rights or ganizations accused of or chestrating the extrajudicial killings of anti-government activists wherever he was stationed. Noted the Melo Commission: “There is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed for ces, in particular General Palparan, as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, to lerating, and even encouraging the killings.” Palparan denied being directly responsible for the killings, though he did state “I just in spired the [triggermen]. We’re not admitting responsibility here, what I’m saying is these are necessary in cidents.” Those assassinated have in cluded pastors, labor leaders, student activists, farmers, workers, and journalists—at least fifty-nine of the latter were killed between 2001 and 2009, because of reasons directly related to their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which ranks the Philippines as one of the most dangerous places for its profession. As a veteran Manila columnist Luis Teodoro wrote, “The killings are an in tegral part of the policy to dismantle whatever else remains of the democratic and populist legacies” brought about by the 1986 overthrow of the Marcoses"

On November 23, 2009, the worst case of a political massacre in the recent history of the country took place on the dusty roads of Maguindanao Province, turf of the Ampatuan clan, close political allies of President Macapagal Arroyo —the very same clan whose patriarch, governor Andal Ampatuan, had guaranteed her 2004 electoral victory in his province. Close to sixty people were slain by gunmen who had stopped the convoy they were traveling in, and the two or three vehicles that happened to be passing by as well. All the occupants— men, women, and children—were for ced to get out of their vehicles and marched to a nearby hilltop, where they were shot. None survived. The bodies were buried in a mass grave, dug up earlier, a backhoe still on the scene, one that apparently belonged to the provincial government. The murdered in cluded thirty journalists—the most killed in one in cident in the country, and the worst such case in recent press history globally, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They were accompanying the convoy headed to the provincial capital, where the candidacy papers of a potential gubernatorial rival was to be filed, for the 2010 elections. A majority of the victims were women, most of them Muslims. The rival clan, the Mangudadatus, believed that if the party were made up mainly of women, they would not be harmed, as the Koran teaches that they and children should be respected, even in times of conflict. Certainly contributing to the continuing threat of more human rights abuses was the passage by the Philippine Congress in July of 2007, of the Human Security Act (HSA)—a virtual copy of the U. S. Homeland Security Act. By broadening the government’s arrest-and-detention powers, the law seriously undermined civil liberties. With its vague definition of what constitutes “terrorism,” HSA in effect criminalized political dissent, e. g., burning an effigy could be seen as a terrorist act. In August of that year, in one of the first in stances of the law’s application, three visiting women’s-rights activists and members of the U. S.-based Gabriela Network, an affiliate of Gabriela Philippines, the nation’s largest feminist militant group with party-list representation in Congress, were in itially prevented from leaving Manila. Having at tended the 10 th Women’s International Solidarity Affair in the Philippines, the three found the mselves on a government watch list due to suspected ties to the Taliban—a nonsensical charge that was later dropped, and the women allowed to depart. It was a chilling exercise in arbitrary detention. The Cancer of Endemic Corruption The fact that the worldwide financial meltdown of 2008 didn’t affect the Philippines too much was, as it was in 1997, not so much due to the strength of the economy but rather to the relative lack of in tegration into global financial markets. Philippine banks, having taken steps to strengthen the mselves during the 1997 Asian financial crisis and conservative in their lending policies, were not as reliant as U. S. and European banks had been on financial products that turned out to be to xic. Nevertheless, since the United States plays a major part in the economy of the country—in 2007, it was the source of 33 percent of direct for eign in vestment—the pinch was bound to be felt. While negative growth was avoided, there were layoffs by for eign corporations such as Intel Philippines, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company shut down its plant first established in 1950. Additionally, remittances from OFWs, which make up 10 percent of GDP and with out which the Philippine economy would be in mortal danger (in 2009, these to taled $17.3 billion), lessened as the recession in such countries as the U. S. and the UK led to the layoffs of for eign workers. And with a global weakening of consumption, exports were expected to decline. The Philippines spends one-third of its budget just servicing its $54 billion for eign debt (as of the beginning of 2009), monies that could otherwise stimulate the economy and reduce the high levels of poverty—still the best single recruiter of angry young militants—with 44 percent of the population subsisting on $2 a day. Hunger is a daily companion to at least 20 percent of the population. Workers see their purchasing power weaken. In 2009, out of 73 cities globally, Manila ranked 70 th in terms of what the or dinary worker’s wages could buy. Another factor that bleeds the economy, as noted, has been the policy of militarization to combat in surgency, which has not worked. If it seemed effective during the Huk in surgency of the 1950 s, that was due to civil programs such as land resettlement for peasant Huk fighters and the speedy resolution of judicial cases. But the illness that vitiates the body politic above all is that of corruption. The tremendous amounts of illicit lucre to be gained in elective of fice and in many of the government-sector jobs has created a culture of impunity, with the result that the term “public service” too of ten becomes an oxymoron. Manila’s most pressing need is to root out corruption in government, a cancer that in the long run not only encourages but wreaks havoc more than any in surgency, and makes junior military of ficers harbor thoughts of coup d’etat. From the underpaid policeman susceptible to bribes from a motorist who commits a traffic violation to a desk-bound government bureaucrat who discreetly wangles for a commission or kickback to expedite the processing of a contract, corruption is a deeply entrenched fact of government"

From the underpaid policeman susceptible to bribes from a motorist who commits a traffic violation to a desk-bound government bureaucrat who discreetly wangles for a commission or kickback to expedite the processing of a contract, corruption is a deeply entrenched fact of government. Ranked by Transparency International in terms of corruptibility, in 2008 the Philippines was 141 st out of 180 nations. In contrast, the country’s Southeast Asian neighbors, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, were ranked 47 th, 80 th, and 126 th, respectively. Two government departments long notorious as places to earn quick and easy money are the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Customs Bureau. According to a World Bank study quoted in a 2003 Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism report into how certain of ficials at the BIR amassed considerable wealth, half of every tax peso that can be collected is lost to corruption. The government’s Department of Finance says that to tal average annual tax leakage is 240 billion in pesos, or roughly $5.1 billion. The PCIJ report went on to say, “BIR postings are so lucrative and BIR of ficials so used to tampering [with] of ficial records that they try to delay retirement by ‘correcting’—pushing for ward—their dates of birth…. From 1989 to the first quarter of 2001 alone, 24 BIR personnel have petitioned the Civil Service Commission to change their birth records.” Civil service requirements decree enforced retirement at the age of 65. The losses of revenue from the corruption at Customs are another example of how pervasive this culture of payoffs and kickbacks is, and demonstrate how the burden of taxation falls disproportionately on the average Filipino taxpayer. According to a study made of the trade between the Philippines and China, between 1994 and 2007, every year revealed substantial discrepancies between the value of what China exported to the Philippines and the value declared by the Bureau of Customs of those goods or imports. In 1994, the difference was $181.4 million, or 38.1 percent less than the Chinese valuation. In 2007, the difference was $3.470 billion, or almost 50 percent of what the Chinese declared. The differences when it comes to Philippine exports to China are even greater. Thus, for 2007, according to export and import manifest forms supplied by Customs and compiled by the government’s own National Statistics Office, Philippine exports were valued at $5.715 billion while the Chinese valued the very same goods at $23.12 billion—a whopping difference of $17.405 billion, thrice more than the of ficial Philippine figure. The study concludes that “the value of Philippine exports to China for 1994-2007 were understated by an annual average of 137 percent, while the value of imports of the Philippines were understated by an annual average of 46.6 percent.” Clearly, when businessmen underreport both exports and imports, they save hugely on taxes and tariffs. The undervaluation of for eign products in turn hurts the domestic in dustry that manufactures the same kind of goods. The footwear, textile, garment and the nascent petrochemical in dustries are in stances where the combination of low tariffs, and smuggling has had a huge negative impact. Nor is the trade with China the largest source of revenue losses. In an analysis of data made under the auspices of the Manila-based University of Asia and the Pacific and conducted by Dr. Victor Abola, an economist, the results in dicated that between 1999 and 2001, “the largest trade leakages came from trade with Japan, the United States, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, and China,” with discrepancies ranging from 24.4 percent to 35.9 percent. Should the revenue losses due to corruption be stemmed considerably, the effects on the economy would be obvious: the principal on the country’s for eign debt could be paid off in a few years, expenditures on social services could be in creased, and in centives for joining the guerrillas in the hills would be diminished. Food Production The reliance on agricultural exports, or cash crops, has meant that production for local consumption and self-sufficiency in food has suffered. Instead, due to trade liberalization, there is an over-reliance on food imports. If the country is to improve its capacity to feed an ever-in creasing population, the government must pay at tention as well to more efficient agricultural production. According to a 2008 study, once the Philippines became a member of the World Trade Organization in 1995, “the contribution of local agriculture to the GDP … declined from 20.3 percent in 1995 to 14.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Of the 14.2 million hectares alienable and disposable lands, 93 percent or 13 million hectares are classified as agricultural lands and yet agricultural mechanization remains at the tail-end of our neighboring countries. Less than one percent of farmers use tractors and power tillers. Only five bags of fertilizer from the recommended eight per hectare is [ sic ] being used.” In terms of mechanization and rice production per hectare the Philippines ranked eight and sixth respectively out of eleven Asian countries. The result is one of the lowest productivity rates in Southeast Asia. By 2009, the country had at tained the dubious distinction of being the world’s largest importer of rice, with a to tal of 2.2 metric tons, mostly from Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States, with some shipments from China and Pakistan. The obvious irony in this is that the Philippines used to be an exporter of rice. Moreover, Vietnam and Thailand (the world’s largest exporter of rice) learned rice cultivation methods from the Philippine-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), which has developed high-yield varieties of rice"

Moreover, Vietnam and Thailand (the world’s largest exporter of rice) learned rice cultivation methods from the Philippine-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), which has developed high-yield varieties of rice. It was with some urgency that the Arroyo administration announced plans, also in 2009, to at tain self-sufficiency in rice by 2010—though how that would be at tained was left unclear. Creating and aggravating the in sufficiencies of domestic food production particularly in the case of rice is the lack of systematic and comprehensive government programs to provide, for in stance, credit to small farmers, develop in frastructure such as irrigation, in crease government purchase of rice (and thus lessen the importation of rice), and in stitute a genuine land-reform program to address landlessness. Changing the Game to Suit the Players By the end of her term in mid 2010, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo will have been in power as president longer than any other Philippine president, with the notable exception of Ferdinand Marcos, who had defeated her father, President Diosdado Mapacagal, when the latter ran for reelection in 1964. Like Ramos, President Arroyo signaled her desire to continue on as president or chief executive, through a change from the presidential to the parliamentary system of government. The speaker of the House of Representatives, dominated by her supporters, pushed in 2009 for a resolution that the House convene itself—and itself alone—as a Constituent Assembly that would then consider amendments to the 1987 Constitution, ostensibly to override provisions that stand in the way of fast-track economic development, and to switch to the parliamentary system. There are arguments to be made for a switch to a system that its advocates say is more responsive to Philippine political realities. Under a parliamentary system, for in stance, it would have been easier to force Macapagal Arroyo to step down if she had been prime minister rather than president. But political analysts, and public sentiment seems to agree, in sist that the Constituent Assembly, or Con-Ass, as it is referred to disparagingly in the media, really aims to convert the current presidential system to a parliamentary one, so that President Arroyo can then serve as prime minister and sidestep the current constitutional ban on a second-term presidency that would require her to vacate the presidency after the May 2010 national elections. The Senate has warned the lower House of its unwavering opposition were the congressmen to push on ahead with out the Senate. And there will most certainly be opposition in the streets were the 1987 Freedom Constitution altered to suit the ambitions of one person. This was made abundantly clear when for mer President Corazon Aquino, at the age of 76, died from colon cancer on August 1, 2009. The outpouring of grief was overwhelming. People stood in line for three to four hours for a quick glimpse of the late president. It took the funeral procession, at tended by an honor guard from the different military branches, nine hours to reach the memorial park where she was buried alongside her late husband Ninoy Aquino, due to the throngs that lined the streets six deep, many bearing her portrait or likeness and signs that at tested to the love people bore for her. The national mourning and the praise heaped on her as she lay in her bier, reminded anyone who needed reminding that the country had not for gotten the pivotal role that their Tita Cory (Aunt Cory) had played in replacing the twenty- year regime of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with a freewheeling, raucous democracy, however flawed. The public comparison between the recently deceased for mer president who never wished to extend her stay in Malacañang even by one day, and the sitting president who has made it clear that she does, rendered crystal clear the dismay with which Macapagal Arroyo’s tenure, and stature, have been viewed. That dismay was reflected in the sudden ascent of Cory and Ninoy’s son, Noynoy, elected to the Senate in 2004, to being the presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, when Senator Mar Roxas (grandson of Manuel, first president of the Republic), with drew in his favor and agreed to run for vice president in stead. Noynoy is the sentimental favorite to win, and it will be very difficult for any other presidential candidate to match his popularity. Like Fidel Ramos, realizing that changing the current presidential system to a parliamentary one would be an uphill battle, in late November of 2009, President Macapagal Arroyo filed her candidacy papers, to run for election as congresswoman from her home province of Pampanga—the first president in Philippine history to seek lower of fice. She would be replacing her son, Congressman Mike Arroyo Jr. This move has triggered in tense speculation that she has done so in or der to head off any at tempt on the part of the next Congress to hold her to account for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors while president, and to spearhead a renewed drive to in stitute a parliamentary system, so she can then seek the post of prime minister. Whether the next president and a new Congress will listen to the persistent voices of the electorate for substantial changes in the mode of governance to resemble more faithfully a much more democratic society remains to be seen. Serious, reform-minded legislators would have to go against the grain of special- in terest clan politics—in essence, against their own families—no mean feat in a society long accustomed to the transference of power and privilege along blood lines. Many of these elected mandarins are more in tune with Louis XIV’s dictum, “L’etat, c’est moi,” than with the democratic notion of a government by the people, for the people, and of the people"

Whether the next president and a new Congress will listen to the persistent voices of the electorate for substantial changes in the mode of governance to resemble more faithfully a much more democratic society remains to be seen. Serious, reform-minded legislators would have to go against the grain of special- in terest clan politics—in essence, against their own families—no mean feat in a society long accustomed to the transference of power and privilege along blood lines. Many of these elected mandarins are more in tune with Louis XIV’s dictum, “L’etat, c’est moi,” than with the democratic notion of a government by the people, for the people, and of the people. President Aquino’s heart, her corazon, was undoubtedly in the right place, but family pressure as much as anything else doomed her land reform program since it left the family’s vast Hacienda Luisita untouched. Nowhere is the hold of clan politics more evident than in Congress, the nation’s preeminent legislative body. Ever since the Malolos Congress of 1898, lawmakers have consistently been drawn from the ranks of the Philippine elite. A groundbreaking study conducted by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and published in 2004, The Rulemakers, describes the modern Filipino legislator as predominantly male, someone who “has previously held a local government post and is a member of a political family with a sibling, father, or grandfather who has been voted into public of fice in the past.” A perfect illustration of how political power, once at tained, breeds a sense of entitlement is the Cojuangco family, which has had nine members elected to Congress since 1907, with President Cory Cojuangco Aquino representing the zenith of clan power. Her and Ninoy Aquino’s son, Noynoy, may yet reclaim that position. (Through him of course are linked two powerful political families, with the Aquinos, as of 2004, having had eight members elected to Congress.) Cory’s main rival, Ferdinand Marcos, with his own father having been a local politician, established the Marcoses as a political dynasty, serving as a congressman, then senator, and going on to rule the state for twenty-one years, with Imelda beside him. In a series of musical-chair moves, his heirs are making sure the family remains a prominent player on the political scene. His son, Ferdinand Jr., has served as governor of Ilocos Norte—Marcos’s home province, where the late dictator is viewed almost as a deity—and will be running for the Senate in 2010. His sister Imee, having served in Congress, will now run for the governorship vacated by her sibling. And the ruling matriarch Imelda, resilient as ever even at the age of 80, having represented her home district of Leyte as a congresswoman, has filed her candidacy papers for the congressional seat Imee is leaving behind. There have been positive changes to the almost monopolistic nature of the power structure. The party-list feature, in troduced by the 1987 Constitution, has produced cracks in the façade; while party-list representatives are a minority bloc, still, they do bring viewpoints that represent the left as well as segments of society—workers, women, the youth—normally underrepresented in Congress. The party-list solons eschew the trappings of their more conventional colleagues, portraying the mselves as non-traditional politicians. Another pressure block is that of the overseas Filipino workers who have registered for the May 2010 elections, numbering approximately 600,000—almost twice the number that registered for the 2004 elections. With a perspective gained from living abroad, they are not as subject to the in tense politicking that goes on in the islands in the run-up to the elections and are the refore less likely to feel bound by parochial in terests. Candidates who can tap into their discontent would have quite an advantage at the polls. In the continuing dance between for mer colonizer and for mer colony, the United States remains the country’s most dominant for eign partner. While the U. S. no longer to uts the Philippines as a showcase of democracy, it of ten in vokes what it terms the “special relationship” between the two countries. This is echoed in how Manila reliably follows the lead of Washington when it comes to for eign policy. In both its regional and in ternational in volvement, whether through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperative (APEC), or the United Nations, the Philippines rarely deviates, if at all, from any given United States position. It was not surprising the refore that in 2002, President Arroyo stepped for ward as the first Asian president to endorse the U. S.-in itiated Global War on Terror, for which the U. S. designated the Philippines as a major non-NATO ally in 2003. In economic terms, this “special relationship” translates into the U. S. being the Philippines’ largest trading partner, with $17 billion worth of trade in 2008, and $6 billion in direct in vestments. The country is the U. S.’s 31 st largest export market and its 37 th largest supplier. Starkly put, the challenge is for the Philippine government to forge a more in dependent for eign policy while maintaining its trading ties with the United States. One way to do that is to develop wisely and efficiently the natural resources with which the country, like its Southeast Asian neighbors and so many other developing countries, is abundantly blessed. While afflicted, for in stance, by deforestation, destruction of its coral reefs, and depletion of rich fishing grounds, the country sits on enormous mineral reserves—gold, copper, nickel, silver, gypsum, among them—said to be one of the world’s largest and estimated to be worth at least $840 billion. In addition, off the coast of Palawan Island are believed to lie tremendous natural gas reserves. Given these treasures, there is every reason the country should manage to lift itself out of poverty that has crippled it for so long and that propels millions of its citizens to seek a better life outside its borders. To do that, there has to be a consistent, long-term, and transparent government-funded anti-corruption drive, accompanied by more efficient revenue collection to provide for much- needed government services and to regularly upgrade the country’s perennially creaky in frastructure. And the narrow, personalized politics of clan rule—with its roots in the datu system abetted by a procession of colonial rulers—must give way to the rule of the majority rather than the few"

Somewhat like its mineral wealth, the country’s democratic spirit may at times appear to be buried but it is vast and powerful. That democratic spirit has been tapped into before, most notably in 1896 and in 1986. To harness it on an on going basis and transform the nation fundamentally and for the better has always been the challenge faced by the Philippine Republic since its in ception."

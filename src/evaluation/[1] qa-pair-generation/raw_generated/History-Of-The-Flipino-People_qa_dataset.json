One patent Filipino trait that imme¬ diately commends itself to the for eigner is his hospitality. All peoples the world over are hospitable in their own way, but Filipino hospitality is something that is almost a fault. This hospitality to a fault has been misunder¬ stood by many for eigners, particularly by the Spanish adventurers of the previous century, who thought that such show of profuse hospitality was a form of in feriority and obsequiousness. The Filipino has very dose family ties. The family has been the unit of society and everything revolves around it. The Filipino family or dinarily consists of the grandparents, the parents, and the children. The father is the head of the family, but while he rules, the mother governs. For it is the mother that reigns in the home: she is the educator, the financial of ficer, the laundrywoman, and the cook. Respect for the elders is one Filipino trait that has remained in the book of I X ■ ■ ' - HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE By TEODORO A.

PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION This new edition of History of the Filipino People is a ful¬ fillment of the wish of the late Professor Teodoro A. Agoncillo who had in dicated in various occasions to members of his family and friends the need to update the text in response to changing situations. One of the changes effected is the replacement of the chapters written by the junior co-author and the in corporation of other materials the senior author would have-done. The difficult task of revision was assumed by the family with the in valuable help of scholar friends who had given more than casual time, efforts, and commitments to bring out the necessary changes in the text. Especially acknowledged with enduring appreciation are the many acts of kindness and assistance extended to the family by Dr. Bemardita R. Churchill, Dr. Isagani R. Medina, and Dr. Samuel K. Tan — all from the Department of History, University of the Philippines, Diliman, and in timate associates of the late professor. This eighth edition, which is of fered to teachers, students, and readers of Philippine history, with the same sense of purpose that had marked the late professor's works is one of the affection¬ ate tributes that his family wishes to of fer to his memory.

The land surface is 114,830 square statute miles and is criss-crossed with mountains and drained by small river systems. Volcanic in or igin, the mountain ranges “form the circuit and watersheds of the Pacific basin of the earth’s sur¬ face.”* Mountain Systems.—There are three large ranges in the mountain system of Luzon which form ramparts around the Central Plains. The Caraballo del Sur, which forms the nucleus of the system, has its highest peak at the in tersection of the boundaries of Abra, Ilocos Norte, and Cagayan. The Caraballos Occidentales divide into the Cordillera Norte and Cordillera Central and traverse the region west of the Cagayan River. The Sierra Madre, also known as the Pacific coast range, begins at Baler, Quezon, and crosses Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Cagayan. This is the longest continuous range in the Philippines. The mountain ranges of the eastern and southeastern provinces of Luzon extend from the Caraballo de Baler to San Bernardino Strait in the south, culminating in May on Volcano in Albay and Bulusan Volcano in Sorsogon. The Zambales range starts at Cape Bolinao and follows the China Sea coast to the Bataan Peninsula. The Tagaytay range passes through Cavite and Batangas and, with Mt.

Apo is the highest; and the Western range which begins west of Iligan Bay and ends on the shore of Basilan Strait. River Systems.—The Philippines has extensive but small river systems which are mostly delineated by the mountain ranges. The fluvial system of Luzon is represented by (1) the Rio Grande de Cagayan and its tributaries, which drain the Cagayan Valley; (2) the Agno Grande which drains Benguet and the valleys of Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, and Tarlac; (3) the Abra River system, which receives its tributaries from the Cordillera and drains Lepanto, Bontoc, and Abra; and (4) the Rfo Grande de Pampanga and its tributaries, which drain the fertile valleys of Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Bulacan. Mindanao has the largest river system in the Philippines. The Rio Grande de Mindanao drains the central basin of Min¬ danao and receives the waters of two flakes. Agusan, which is second to the Rfo Grande, drains the basin of Surigao. Volcanoes and Earthquakes.—Volcanoes dot the three geo¬ graphic regions of the country and have been for centuries one of the natural causes of destruction of life and property. At least ten of these volcanoes are considered active; the rest are dormant. The most famous of these are, from north to south, Iraya in Batanes Island; Taal in Batangas; Banahaw in Quezon; Mayon in Albay; Hibok-Hibok in Camiguin Island; Makaturing in Lanao; and Apo in Davao. Of these volcanoes, Mayon has been the most active. It has erupted more than thirty times since 1615, while Taal Volcano, the smallest in the world and situated in the middle of Taal Lake, has erupted no less than thirty-three times. Its most destructive eruption took place on January 30, 1911, which killed more than 1,300 persons. The eruption which took place in early dawn of September 28, 1965 buried six barrios and led to the loss of 300 lives. The eruption of July 5 and after, 1966 did little damage to life and property. The last eruption took place on September 3, 1976. THE SETTING 3 The Philippines lies within the Pacific seismic belt and has consequently experienced severe earthquakes, though these have not been as destructive as those that had rocked Japan. Manila experienced a severe earthquake in 1937 when many buildings in the commercial district were partly destroyed. The earth¬ quake of August 2, 1968 was so violent that an apartment build¬ ing collapsed, killing hundreds of people. One of the most de¬ structive earthquakes in Philippine history occurred on June 3, 1863, when the Manila Cathedral and hundreds of government structures and residential houses collapsed and many people were killed, in cluding the famous Filipino priest, Dr. Pedro Pablo Pelaez. Another destructive earthquake occurred on April 1, 1955 when the Visayas and Mindanao were rocked by a series of quakes ranging from Intensity III to Intensity VIII. Millions of pesos and hundreds of lives were lost in the region around Lake Lanao, Mindanao. By far the most destructive earth¬ quake that occurred in the Philippines was the one that struck Mindanao on August 17, 1976. Its Intensity was VIII. This earthquake triggered a tidal wave that rendered 90,000 persons homeless, 3,000 dead, and more than 3,000 missing or presumed to be dead. Hundreds of millions worth of property were de¬ stroyed, thus making rehabilitation a difficult task. In the face of this disaster, President Marcos announced that the Filipinos would stand on their own feet and would not accept any for eign aid, especially aid with strings at tached. Coastline.—Aside from the ruggedness of the land mass, the Philippines has an irregular coastline that extends to about 10,850 statute miles, twice as long as that of continental United States. Such irregularity results in contours that make for nu¬ merous fine harbors and landlocked straits. Manila Bay, which has an area of a little more than 700 square miles and a circum¬ ference of 120 miles, is one of the finest natural harbors in the world. All big islands and a host of small islands have natural harbors that can accommodate large ships. In stormy weather, these harbors, located strategically from north to south, have been the refuge of ships in distress. Products and Natural Resources.—The Philippine* is rich in natural resources that are as yet largely undeveloped. Its fertile plains and rich valleys produce diverse crops a few of which are produced for export and the rest for local consump¬ tion. Rice, the staple crop of the country, is produced largely in the Central Plains of Luzon, but the to tal production is not 4 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE sufficient to meet the ever in creasing demand of an exploding population"

The still primitive way of agriculture is one of the causes of the failure of the Philippines to produce enough rice for export. However, a breakthrough in rice production was made during the first four years of President Ferdinand Marcos’ administration when the so-called “miracle rice” was developed. Other products, however, have been raised for export. Cop¬ ra, abaca, gums, resins, rubber, and sugar have found ready markets abroad. Lumber, minerals, and metals have been ex¬ ported in large quantities to swell Philippine exports to an average of about P 800,000,000. Mining, which is a basic in¬ dustry, produces more than 700 million pesos worth of minerals. Metallic minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, and chromium are exploited for their commercial value, while the non-metallic minerals like salt, coal, clay, as¬ bestos, sulphur, gravel, limestone, and gypsum are so far not yet exploited for large-scale export. It is suspected that oil is present in some Philippine sites, but at tempts to locate these sites have so far been unsuccessful. The Philippine for ests, which cover some 40,000 square miles, produce timber for local consumption and export. Phil¬ ippine hardwoods are known the world over. However, in re¬ cent years, senseless and unscrupulous timbermen have practi¬ cally denuded the for ests, with the result that the water supply of the lowlands has been tremendously lessened and the num¬ ber of trees considerably reduced. The People.'-The Filipino belongs to a mixture of races, although basically he is a Malay. Centuries of cultural and commercial contacts with the countries of Asia and almost four centuries of domination by Western Powers have made the Fili¬ pino comparatively sophisticated. There is in him a blending of the East and the West, so that his character exhibits curious contradictions which for eigners are apt to misunderstand. Doubt¬ less, the Filipino at the coming of the Spaniards was brown¬ skinned like his Malay for ebears. With Spanish colonization, however, there appeared a kind of Filipino who was obviously the result of the not-so-licit relations between the conqueror and the conquered. This light-skinned and high-nosed Filipino multiplied with the coming of the Americans.' The in ter-marriage between the Filipino and the for eigner, particularly the white, led to a class known as the mestizo class, also humorously called THE SETTING 5 the “mestizoisie.77 In Philippine society, it is well to distinguish the types or classes of mestizos. When one says mestizo, the obvious implication is that the person spoken of is Spanish- Filipino. All other half-breeds are qualified by the nationality of their parents. Thus, a Filipino with an American father or mother is called an American mestizo; with a Chinese father or mother, a Chinese mestizo; with an Indian father or mother, an Indian mestizo, and so on down the line. Between the mestizo and the “native”, there has been a barrier of feeling that borders on hostility. This feeling has its or igin in the late Spanish period or, more specifically, during the nineteenth century, when the mestizo, by virtue of his social and financial status, looked down upon the “native” as a boor. The “native” naturally resented this at titude and in turn in¬ fused the term mestizo with unsavory connotations, e. g., pre¬ tentious, boastful, arrogant, etc. In the mind of the “native”, the mestizo was in solent: his posture of superiority to the “na¬ tive” arose from his awareness of his Spanish or igins. But while thus striking a superior posture before the “native”, the mestizo almost always felt in ferior to the “pure” Spaniard who considered him so far below him as not to be taken seriously. The mestizo, the refore, during the Spanish period, was Janus¬ faced: he was a Spaniard before a “native”, and a Filipino be¬ fore a Spaniard.1 The uneasy feeling between the “native” and the mestizo still exists, although very much watered down. It flares up once in a while, as when an eminent columnist, at the height of the discussions on the American bases question early in 1959, called down a senator by claiming that the latter, being a mestizo, could not be expected to defend the rights of the Fili¬ pinos in so far as the question was concerned. Surely, being a mestizo cannot be taken as an argument against the senator, but the columnist, in calling him down, merely brought to the ment al surface what may be loosely termed the “racial” expe¬ rience, that is to say, the old role of the mestizo in Philippine society and the age-old feeling of the “native” against the mestizo.

Knock at the door of even the humblest rustic and he of fers you his home. In other climes you might be suspected of being a hoodlum or a poseur. Consequently, you might be looked upon with suspicion. Call it naivete but the Filipino opens his heart to you, a complete stranger, and of fers you the best in his kitchen and bed chamber. He makes the bed for you and asks you, usually with a profusion of apo¬ logies, to make yourself feel “at home”, while he, the host, sleeps on the cold floor. He prepares water for your morning ablution, waits upon you at the table, and makes life worth living for you. Perhaps you happen to drop in at an unholy hour of the day or night. Sensing that you are hungry, he prepares the best food for you, ignoring the fact that there would not be enough for the next supper of his family. Meanwhile, he gives \"you something to while away your time. You hear him or his wife puttering about the kitchen desperately hurrying^up the - preparation of the food in or der not to keep you waiting. There is always a sense of urgency in his movements, for he does not want to in convenience you. He makes you feel that he is honored by your in vasion of his privacy at an unholy hour of the day or night. This hospitality to a fault has been misunder¬ stood by many for eigners, particularly by the Spanish adven¬ turers of the past century, who thought that such show of profuse hospitality was a form of in feriority and obsequious¬ ness. Thus, Rizal records that some Spaniards of the last century used to regale their hearers in the Peninsula with tales about the “Indios” whose hospitality they savored and abused and, having abused it, proceeded to tell their hearers that they fell “victims” to the wiles of the Filipino women. The Filipino has very close family ties. The family has been the unit of society and everything revolves around it. The Filipino family or dinarily consists of the grandparents, the pa- THE SETTING 7 rents, and the children. Tfce father is the head of the family, but while he rules, the mother governs. For it is the mother that reigns in the home: she is the educator, the financial of¬ ficer, the accountant, the censor^ the laundrywoman, and the cook. But over and above the “ruler” and the “governor” are the grandparents, whose opinions and decisions oh all impor¬ tant matters are sought. Will a new-born child be baptized? The grandparents are consulted and what they say carries much weight. Ignore them and you risk their stinging rebuke. Is the child sick? Will you call a doctor? Wait a minute, the grand¬ father thinks an herbolario (herb doctor) is enough. He has reached his rtfre old age with out having known a doctor. Do you think you can reach his age? Why, then, should you risk the life of the child by calling in somebody whose experience is limited to turning gadgets he, an old man, does not under¬ stand? No, he will not allow his beloved grandchild to be to uched, by the midico! You wring your hands in sheer frustration, appeal to him in the name of modem science — and get a stem look or a verbal dressing down for your efforts. The “tyranny” of the elders is such that the Filipino family, in spite of the in roads of modem civilization, has remained basically the same. Respect for the elders is one Filipino trait that has re¬ mained in the book of unwritten laws. The Filipino parent exercises almost absolute powers over the children. It is un¬ thinkable for a Filipino to do an important thing with out con¬ sulting his parents. The latter do not condone children talk¬ ing back not only to them, but to those older than they are. The particle pd may look in nocent to you, but that little word shows respect for another. In no other language is respect for another carried to higher point than in the Philippine lan¬ guages. Are you speaking to an older man or woman? Then use the second person plural — kay 6, inyd or ninyo. You are branded disrespectful and impolite if you use the second person singular: ka, mo, or ikaw. Is the person you are talking with of your age but a stranger to you? Then use the second per¬ son plural! And don’t for get the particle po! It is a sign of good breeding. Next in the degree of respect is the use of the first person plural: at in, natin, tayo. Here the speaker and the person spoken to are lumped to gether and made to appear as one. The peak of respect is achieved by the use of the third person plural: sild, nild, kanild. Unlike the first two degrees of respect, this last shows detachment, making it appear that the person spoken to 8 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE is a faraway person, someone to be handled and referred to gingerly. The elders believe, and demand, that they be obeyed — right or wrong. That you have a string of degrees to your credit does not impress the elders; they know, for certain, that your academic degrees cannot compare favorably with their expe¬ rience. Yours is the knowledge; the irs the wisdom — they have drunk more water than you have! Their decision must, there¬ fore, be sought on all important matters that affect the whole family, for what happens to one of the members affects the rest. There is, then, collective responsibility in the family. It is this closeness of family ties, in particular, the collective responsibility, that accounts for the late development of Filipino nationalism. For no matter how cruelly and unjustly a member of the family had been treated, the elders cautioned the victim to be patient: remember, they used to say, that not only you but all of us will suffer if you retaliate. And the poor man, real¬ izing the consequences of his planned action, controlled his emo¬ tions, swallowed his pride, satisfied himself with biting his lo¬ wer lip, and sheepishly bowed to the will of the elders"

And the poor man, real¬ izing the consequences of his planned action, controlled his emo¬ tions, swallowed his pride, satisfied himself with biting his lo¬ wer lip, and sheepishly bowed to the will of the elders. Rizal painted this common family scene during the Spanish regime in his El Filibusterismo, in the chapter “Cabesang Tales”. Respect for the elders in cludes respect for the elder brother or sister. It is the responsibility of the elder brother to perform the duties of the father and mother to the younger members of the family. One finds that among Filipino families the elder brother (or sister) sacrifices even his career for the sake of the young ones who must have an education. Even after his marriage, the elder brother sets aside a small part of his salary for his younger brothers and sisters. The latter, in turn, are expected to look up to their elder brother with awe and respect. Kissing the hands of parents and old relatives or neighbors as a sign of respect is extended to the elder brother or sister. Among “old” and “respectable families”, even cousins kiss the hands of their elder cousins as a sign of respect. And this brings us to that aspect of Filipino family life which is both reasonable and unreasonable. Since collective re¬ sponsibility characterizes the Filipino family, it follows that the better-off member has to take care not only of his immediate family but also of other relatives. It is not uncommon to see the poor relations go to their employed kin to ask for money. THE SETTING 9 This is done with such regularity that, though annoyed, the “vie- tim” has to bear as much as he can with the importunities of his less for tunate relatives. To reject them is to court disaster: the poor relations will start a whispering campaign against the “tight-fisted” relative. If there is anything that a Filipino fears, it is the charge of being a “bad” relative. This custom of tak¬ ing care of the poor relations is so deeply in grained in the Filipino character that one may trace the root of graft and cor¬ ruption to the closeness of family ties. Right or wrong, the family comes first and for emost. Hence the Filipino who rises to a position of power is confronted with the problem of pro¬ viding for his relatives, whose number, by the way, in creases in proportion to the power and in fluence one exercises. The Filipino is naturally fatalistic. No amount of expostu¬ lation on the virtues of science or logic can dislodge him from his idea of fatalism. He believes that whatever happens to him is the work of Fate. This fatalism is best symbolized in the phrase “Bahala na,” a phrase that defies translation but which may be rendered loosely as “come what may.” Can you go through that wall of fire? Bahala na. Are you sure you can convince him to give up his plan of leaving home? Bahala na. There are dangers ahead, don’t be so foolish as to rush in where angels fear to tread. Bahala na. This is the last morsel we have; where do we get to morrow’s food? Bahala na. Don’t gamble your last centavo: you might go home with pockets in side out. Bahala na. He is big and strong; can you fight him? Bahala na. Such fatalism has bred in the Filipino a sense of resignation. It is thus that he faces disaster or tragedy with resignation. He appears in different in the face of graft and corruption. He appears impassive in the face of personal misfortune. Yet this “j Bahala na” at titude prevents him from being a crackpot. Loyalty to a friend or to a benefactor is one trait that is very strong in the Filipino. Do him a little favor and he re¬ members you to the end of his days. For to the Filipino, friend¬ ship is sacred and implies mutual help under any circumstances. A friend is expected to come to the aid not only of a personal friend, but also of the latter’s family. A man’s friend is con¬ sidered a member of the family and is expected to share its tribulations as well as its prosperity and happiness. It is almost unthinkable for the Filipino to betray his friend, and if there 10 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE be such one, he becomes a marked man: ostracism is the lightest punishment that can be meted out to him. •• This concept of loyalty to a friend explains why the Filipino sulks at the thought of not receiving enough aid from the United States. Maintaining that he, as soldier or as civilian during the last World War, fought side by side with the Yankee, the Filipino believes, rightly or wrongly, that he deserves more generous aid from the United States than, say, the Japanese, who was a for mer common enemy. To the Filipino, it is hardly conceivable that the United States should turn out to be an “Migrate”, know¬ ing as she does that he stood by her in the darkest hour. This at titude, on the other hand, is beyond the comprehension of the American, for the latter’s understanding of friendship is different from that of the Filipino. The American is ruthlessly businesslike and will not allow sentimentalism to stand in the way of fulfilling his destiny or objective. This “ruthlessness” the Filipino does not understand. Hence the continued misunderstanding between the Filipino and the American with respect to material aid. The American, then, suspects that the Filipino is sensitive. He is. He would not to lerate anyone berating his countryman. He is easily piqued when a for eigner, for in stance, makes a sweep¬ ing generalization that is not flattering to the Filipinos, no matter how true the observation may be.

When an American teacher of English at the Manila North (now Arellano) High School said, way back in January 1930, that a Filipino brother and sister, sitting beside each other in a desk, were not so clean and that “You should get into the habit of cleaning yourselves”, she probably meant no harm. But the Filipino school boys and girls took it as an in sult, and for thwith the whole class called a meeting at a store nearby and then and there decided to call a strike. The American teacher was pictured as a monster — particularly because she was not good looking — and ugly words flew thick and fast. The school premises were immediately picketed, and soon the students from other high schools in Manila left their classes to join the strike. The strikers demand the expulsion of the American teacher. The latter was sent back to the United States, but the school authorities, backed up by the American THE SETTING 11 superintendent of schools, suspended the ring, leaders. The tradi¬ tion al March graduation exercises were not held that year. Similar in cidents happened twice in the University of the Philippines a year or two before and in 1931. In the for mer, a certain American lady professor with a Russian surname made what appeared to the students a sweeping, generalization in sult¬ ing to the Filipinos. The result was student furor, which led to the separation of the lady professor from the University. In the second case, an Australian professor of English who was an Oxonian, said, in a Tuesday convocation, that 90% of the Filipino students were cheating in the ex^ninations. That was enough. The students and some professors let loose a barrage of verbal fireworks which for ced the eminent professor to resign. Yet this Australian professor was an admirer of the Filipinos and the writers of the University worshipped him like an ancient anito The Anglo-Saxon frankness is something the Filipino seldom appreciates. The tendency to he in dolent is, certainly, a trait of the Fili¬ pino. Rizal explained this tendency as the result of the tropical climate which makes even the Westerner in dolent in these parts of Paradise. But aside from the warm climate, in dolence may be partly explained by the abundance with which Nature has endowed the country — a fact which makes the Filipino exert less effort in the belief that he does not have to work hard to make both ends meet. Then, too, because of the close family and personal ties, the Filipino is assured of three square meals every day if only he would have the nerve — he usually has — to go from one relative to another. He knows that no relative or friend would turn him out and so he imposes himself on his willing or unwilling victims. ■ ' r ', Side by side with in dolence is lack of in itiative. This trait is explained by a natural fear of competition, for Filipino so¬ ciety is cooperative, not competitive. The experiences of college and university professors reveal the sad fact that the average Filipino student has to be hammered and whipped into line in or der to make him work hard. He will not, on his own in itia¬ tive, read more than what the professor assigns. Why exert o O much effort and spend so much time when one can pass through college with a grade of “3”? To get the white meat of a crab’s legs, so the saying in Tagalog runs, you must pound those legs with a small pestle or with a big knife. And so with the Filipino 12 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE student. \"Not only the average student, but the average trader or businessman is saddled with this burden called lack of in itiative. So afraid is the businessman of competition that he refuses to in vest a huge sum in his business venture. He craves a huge profit out of a small in vestment, but he would not think of putting <uimmo*e capital to expand his business. He is, in Spanish parlance, a segurista — a man who wants to be sure that he does not lose. For this reason, the Filipino trader or businessman is almost always an underdog in relation to his alien competitors. It is only in recent years that the Filipino businessmen and merchants are trying to get rid of the segurista at titude. The Filipino, being childlike, is naturally curious. But his curiosity is tainted with sympathy. There certainly is nothing malicious in his in quiries about one’s health, about one’s child¬ ren, about one’s salary, and so forth.

The man in the street stops, surveys the scene nonchalantly and with apparent unconcern, and even laughs at the cochero who could not persuade his horse to cooperate. Or take the case of a passenger jeepney. It stops in the middle of the street and needs to be pushed to start its machine. The driver signals to the on coming jeepney to push his dilapidated contraption a little. The driver of the on rushing jeepney swerves to the left THE SETTING 13 or to the right to avoid the stalled jeepney with out even look¬ ing at the “embattled” fellow-driver. Oftentimes, one hears the drivers of passing jeepneys shout “Heto ang posporo/” (Here’s a matchstick!), meaning, of course, that the stalled jeepney should be consigned to the flames. Yet, try to in sult or harm a jeepney driver and the whole brood will gang up on you. Jealousy is another trait of the Filipino. He does not look with favor on a woman who flirts with several mem To him the sweetheart’s or the wife’s eyes are meant only for him and for no other. Even his closest friend cannot kiss his wife with impunity on the pretext that it is a “brotherly” kiss. The Filipino, the refore, requires complete faith and loyalty of his wife or sweetheart. A deviation from this unwritten law of ten¬ times leads to a bloody mess, as the cases of two Filipinos in the United States at test. In the one case, the Filipino, a woman, “accidentally” shot her gallivanting husband; in the second, the Filipino, a man, was accused of but chering his American sweet¬ heart. Bloody killings, of ten enough reported in the daily news¬ papers, are frequent and are usually the upshot of jealousy, for to a Filipino, blood is required to wash the stain on his honor. This may seem bloody enough to a Westerner, but to a Filipino in whose veins flows the Malay “hot” blood, to kill or be killed is an easy way to avenge his honor. The Filipino, too, is regionalistic. He does not think in terms of national boundaries but in regional on eness. This feel¬ ing is an extension of the closeness of family ties. Invariably, the Filipino believes that the person known to him, no matter how bad, is better than the one unknown to him no matter how good. Thus one finds college or university students calling a meeting of all those who come from the Ilocos, from Bulacan, from the Bicol region, from the Visayas, and so forth. And one finds, too, the political situation in which a Visayan can¬ didate for the Presidency of the Republic has a running mate who comes from Luzon or vice versa. In the choice of can¬ didates for senators, the principle of regional representation is followed, although the senators are elected at large. Then, in majority of cases, a Tagalog President gives preference to his fellow-Tagalogs in appointments to high positions. The same is true with an Ilocano President or a Visayan President — with the possible exception of ex-President Sergio Osmena. Among Filipinos, the Tagalogs are the least, if all, regionalistic. 14 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE So strong is this regionalistic feeling that the Filipino of one region looks down upon his countryman of another region. This strong regionalistic feeling may be traced to the Spanish administrators who pursued a policy of “divide and conquer”. The Spanish pattern of behavior in this regard is abundantly proved by the way the numerous revolts and uprisings were put down. Since* there were few Spaniards in the Philippines, they pressed into service, say, the Pampangos, to put down an Ilocano uprising. A Pampango revolt, on the other hand, was put down by the Ilocano soldiers. A Tagalog revolt was usually put down by the Pampangos under the leadership of the Span¬ iards, and so on. Thus, in stead of uniting the Filipinos as a people, the Spaniards succeeded in dividing them by appealing to their regionalistic pride and prejudices. Probably the most discussed trait of the Filipino, especially by the white for eigners and by some Filipino sociologists and psychologists who carry around their bags of esoteric terms, is the sense of pakikisama. Simple as the term may appear to the merely learned, this Filipino trait has not been fully under¬ stood, especially in its connotations. In its or iginal connota¬ tion, pakikisama may be translated loosely as the in tensive signification of camaraderie or spirit of comradeship, the main elements of which are unselfishness and good faith. There is, the refore, no element of deceit, or dishonesty, or subversion of justice, at tached to the term. Thus the terms mabuting mato- sama and its opposite, masamang makisama, really refer to a person’s way of dealing with his fellowmen: if he is selfish, or if he is in capable of empathy, or if he considers himself “an island entire of itself”, he is described as “masamang ma¬ kisama”. But if he is an understanding man, unselfishly help¬ ful, and participates cheerfully in any community work, he is described as “mabuting makisama 9*. Today, however, owing mainly to the in roads of “civiliza¬ tion”, particularly of politics and materialism, the term paki¬ kisama has been, to many people, especially to the so-called sophisticated, debased into an at titude that makes an amiable crook well-liked or at least admired. For a person to be de¬ scribed as “mabuting makisama”, he must be dishonest, ment ally or otherwise, or unjust, or unfair, or unprincipled by subvert¬ ing justice in or der to be in the good graces of many naive people or, to use the badly battered cliche, “to have a good public image”. He is “mabuting makisama” if he subverts jus- THE SETTING 15 tice to place his relatives, friends, adulators, subservient fol¬ lowers, or relatives of his queridas (back-street women) in juicy positions even with out any qualification"

He is “mabuting makisama” if he helps a friend, a political follower, a relative, or a subservient subaltern by stealing from the public till in or der to practice bogus philan- throphy. On the other hand, he is “masamang makisama” who is too honest and just j; o pervert justice; who refuses ta kow¬ tow to imbeciles and morons with high administrative positions; who in sists on merit and merit alone, not on subservience or political or personal connections, as the basis of promotion; or who refuses to steal from the public treasury in or der to have something to give to his querida or to his lazy friends and rela¬ tives. Thus, in Filipino society to day, the most popular and highly respected people are not the honest in tellectuals and artists, but the “respectable” robbers in high public positions; the experts in issuing press releases praising the mselves for fictitious achieve¬ ments; the crooked public relations men who are adept at twisting facts in or der to make an idiot appear a genius in public; and the unprincipled politicians who have never heard of decency and honor. The beautiful Filipino trait of paki- kisama has, the refore, been denuded of its nobility by the political imperatives and by the perverted sense of values that have dominated the character of many Filipinos precisely since the last World War. That noble trait has disappeared from the urban centers and can only be found in its pristine form in the “backward” hamlets where the people have either been un¬ to uched by “civilization” or have been able to defend success¬ fully their simple life against the in roads of crass materialism. Such is the profile of the Filipino. Like all men the world over, he has the weaknesses of the fallen Adam. But he, too, has his strengths and with these he finds his way in and about the society in which he lives and expects to die. Regional Traits.—That the milieu or environment exerts an in fluence in moulding the character of a people is proved in 16 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Philippines where different regions exhibit different and, of tentimes, opposite traits. These traits, which may be termed regional, have been the upshot of economic and social factors. Thus, in poor isolated regions the in habitants are frugal and in dustrious; while in more opulent areas the people are known for their careless abandon and love of the finer things of life. But some characteristic regional traits are, however, difficult to explain in precise economic or social terms. Let us then begin Horn the north and work our way to the south. From the north comes the Ilocano or Samtoy, as he wants to be called. An excursion into the northern region reveals that the Samtoy has spilled into the non-Ilocano provinces of Abra, Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, northern Nueva Ecija, Panga- sinan, Zambales, and a part of Tarlac. The Ilocos region is hemmed in on one side by for bidding mountain ranges and on the other by the restless sea, so that economic opportunities are limited. The small piece of land that he cultivates is not suf¬ ficiently fertile to yield abundant crops. Such an environment could only produce adventurous, in dustrious, hardy, patient, and frugal people. Economic pressure for ces him to migrate to some greener valleys either in Mindanao or in Hawaii and con¬ tinental United States. There, because of his patience, in dustry, and frugality, he carves out his for tune and most of the time succeeds. He is not one to stay put in a locality if better op¬ portunities in some land beckon. It is for this reason that one finds the Samtoy everywhere in the Philippines. Samtoy frugality is proverbial and compares favorably with that of the Scot. It has been the custom of the Filipino to foot the bill if he happens to in vite his companions to, say, a dinner or a round of drinks. It would be difficult for the Samtoy, under the circumstances, to dig into his pockets to take charge of the situation. This is because he earns his money the hard way, and he is not one to nullify his efforts by being a spendthrift. Mention has been made of the barren north. Nature not being so kind to him, the Samtoy finds his surroundings not conducive to humor. Anybody who sees humor in such kind of environment is a bom humorist. The Samtoy is not a bom humorist. He takes life seriously and considers it an object of struggle. That is why he appears sluggish and shy, and creates THE SETTING 17 the impression that he is getting ready to wrestle with the sur¬ rounding for ces. He takes time in deliberating and appears hes¬ itant in his manners. This lumbering characteristic of the Samtoy is shown not only in his physical movements, but also in his writings. He is not the lyrical type; he is, rather, the epic type. Thus it is that he developed epic poetry, as exemplified by Biag ni Lam-ang (life of Lam-ang), a kind of poetry that requires sustained effort. Then, too, while his mood is medita¬ tive his style is, nevertheless, rather elephantine. Compare the prose of such Samtoy stalwarts as Salvador P. Lopez, Leopoldo Y. Yabesf Manuel E. Arguilla, and Consorcio Boije, with, say, that of Federico Mangahas, E. Aguilar Cruz, Carmen G. Nakpil, N. V M. Gonzales, Teodoro M"

Arguilla, and Consorcio Boije, with, say, that of Federico Mangahas, E. Aguilar Cruz, Carmen G. Nakpil, N. V M. Gonzales, Teodoro M. Locsin, Nick Joaquin and other non-Samtoys, and one immediately senses the dragging style of the for mer and the easy, mellifluous ripple of the latter’s prose. Of all Filipinos, the Samtoy is the most regionalistic. As one goes down to the Central Plains and to the area immediately south of it, one finds the Tagalog belt. It com¬ prises the provinces of Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Bataan, a small part of Tarlac, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Batangas, Quezon, and the islands of Marinduque and Mindoro. Manila, the polit¬ ical capital of the Philippines and the center of cultural and commercial life, is at the heart of the region. It is this his¬ to rical accident that makes the Tagalog feel “superior” to the rest of the Filipinos. He is neither frugal nor extravagant. His code of ethics is strict, his pride fierce. The ties that bind him to his home are so strong that, unlike the Samtoy or the Visayan, he prefers to stay put in his homeland than migrating to greener valleys to carve out his for tune. The result is that among the Filipinos he has developed the strongest tendency to live with his parents or in-laws even after his marriage. Less concerned with his environment than his Samtoy brother, the Tagalog enjoys the finer things of life. He is at once a lover, a born poet and a musician. But unlike the Samtoy whose poetry is the sustained epic, the poetry of the Tagalog is lyrical. He is a dreamer and takes the slightest opportunity to burst out into a declamation. Hence the sing-song nature of the Tagalog dec¬ lamation and the impassioned balagtasan (poetical joust). It is no wonder, then, that the best lyricists are found in his region. Jose de la Cruz, popularly known as Huseng Sisiw, Francisco Balagtas, and Jose Corazon de Jesus, in Tagalog; Fernando Ma. 18 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE * j * Guerrero, Cecilio Apostol, Manuel Bemabe, Jesus Balmori, and Claro M. Recto, in Spanish; and Jose Garcia Villa and Nick Joaquin, in English, exemplify the lyrical temper of the Tagalog. The Tagalogs also excel in music. The greatest Filipino composers come from the Tagalog region. Farther south, in the Bicol region, the Bicolano is known for his even temper and religiosity. Kindly like the Visayan, he views life with studied calmness and seldom shows his rough edges; But, like the Visayan, he knows how to enjoy life and to take its of ferings with philosophical equanimity. He is fond of spicy food and no food is good to him which is noj; liberally sprinkled with spices, particularly red pepper. Whether this predilection is a sign of bravery or of the ability to suffer is difficult to ascertain. One thing, however, is definite: when the Bicolano is not enjoying mundane life to the hilt he is con¬ templating it in the church or seminary. Many Filipino taxi dancers and priests come from the Bicol region. The islands south and southwest of Luzon belong to the Vi¬ sayan. He is a happy-go-lucky man more in terested in the here and now than in the past or the future. He exceeds the Tagalog in his love of the finer things of life, so much so that, in con¬ trast with the Samtoy, he is ready to spend his last peso to enjoy life to its last drop. Because he is not compelled by his environment to work half as much as his Samtoy brother, the Visayan is a spendthrift. But like his brother in the north, he is adventurous and is afflicted with wanderlust. The Visayan girl, unlike her Tagalog sister, can leave home with out com¬ punction to follow the gleam of adventure. For this reason, she is more self-reliant than the Tagalog. The Visayan is a hedonist. Give him a jug of tuba and a piece of dried fish and he will sing the wilderness into Paradise. He is a lover like the Tagalog, but he expresses his consuming passion in music, not in poetry. Thus, armed with a banduria, a ukelele or a guitar, he for gets his sorrows, even his hunger, if he is poor, by caressing the strings of his musical in strument and singing to its accompaniment. He may not know the dif¬ ference between a do and a mi on paper, but he can put to gether the notes of the scale to produce lilting, coquettish music. To the extreme south lies Muslimland. The Muslim is, among Filipinos, the fiercest lover of freedom. Adventurous like the Visayan and the Samtoy, he dares the high seas in search of THE SETTING 19 manly adventure. He is a man of honor who sticks to his plighted word and will brave dangers to redeem his vow or promise. He is easily the best friend one can have and, certainly, the worst enemy. He is hardy like the Samtoy and like the latter produced epics. He is proud of his culture and does not of fer meek apologies for it. Thus, while a large part of the Philippines was being sub¬ jugated and Christianized by the conquistadores, the proud Muslim of the south guarded his citadel, swept the seas with his fast vinta to protect himself from the Spanish version of Christian¬ ity and culture, and fought courageously against the Spaniard, later, against the American, in defense of his religion and freedom. One wonders why the Muslim brother has not been in teg¬ rated into the Philippine body politic. There are obvious rea¬ sons. One is that as a non-Christian who has for centuries struggled for his in dividual identity he has come to suspect his Christian brother of betrayal, for the latter was used by the conquerors in their at tempts to obliterate Muslim culture and religion.

Consequently, the Muslim casts suspicious eyes on his Christian brother who, he thinks, is afflicted with Messianic delusion. There is nothing more abominable to the Muslim than to be told to discard his “Moro” way of life. Then, too, the various governments of the Philippines, from the Spanish pe¬ riod down to recent times, had utterly neglected the Muslim, let alone the other minorities. Because of his fierce love of his culture and religion, the Muslim is looked down upon as an aberration — a “Moro”, with all its ugly implications. The result is that he becomes antagonistic to any at tempt to bring him to the Christian society’s fold, for he believes that the at tempt is made not because he is loved, but because his conversion to the Christian way of life is necessary. The proud Muslim does not accept such imposition. Here, then, are the complex traits of each of the major geographic regions of the Philippines. They are traits that make it difficult to define what a Filipino is. Taken to gether, they constitute a cross-section of the people whose character must be understood if their history is to be read correctly. Viewed subjectively, their traits are as a mirror in which every Filipino sees himself. The image in the mirror is a modest profile. A master painter is needed to execute the portrait. BEFORE THE CONQUEST The tradition of Philippine history writing, which the Spanish chroniclers or iginated and which American and Filipino writers followed later, had the Spaniards, more specifically Ferdinand Magellan, discover the Philippines. The obvious implication is that the Philippines, or more accurately, the archipelago later called the Philippines, was unknown to all. However, archeological records and narratives written by Chinese of ficials, in cluding those written by Muslim scholars, point to the early relations of the Philippines with neighboring countries. But these records, written or floating, are not sufficiently numerous to form a continuous and meaningful narrative of Philippine history before the coming of the Spaniards. Even so, the records arc in them¬ selves clear proofs of the existence of a civilization which had an Oriental texture. Peopling of the Philippines.—Up to the early 1970 s, it had been assumed that the Philippines was a part of mainland China. It was the or ized that during the Pleistocene or Ice Age, the waters surrounding what is now the Philippines fell about 156 feet below the present levels. As a result, a vast area of land was exposed and became sort of land bridges to the mainland of Asia. In February, 1976, however, this the ory of the “land bridges” to Asia was disputed by Dr. Fritjof Voss, a German scientist who studied the geology of the Philippines. According to Dr. Voss, the Philippines was never a part of the mainland of Asia but that it rose from the bottom of the sea and “continues to rise as the thin Pacific crust moves below it.” As proof that the Philippines was never a part of the Asian mainland, Dr. Voss points to the fact that when scientific studies were done in 1964-67 on the thickness of the earth’s crust it was found out that the 35-kilometer thick crust underneath China does not extend to the Philippines. Hence, the latter could not have been a part or “land bridge” to the mainland of Asia. On the other hand, the Philippines lies “along the great earth faults extending to deep undersea trenches” and so through violent earthquakes what is now the Philippines rose to the surface of the sea. 20 BEFORE THE CONQUEST 21 Whatever the cause of the Philippines coming to the surface of the sea, it is certain that ancient man came to settle in it. The widely accepted the ory that the Negritos were the aborigines of the Philippines is now severely criticized in anthropologically literate quarters. The Filipino anthropologist, F. Landa Jocano of the University of the Philippines, disputes Professor H. Otley Beyer’s assumption that the Malays migrated to the Philippines and now constitute the largest portion of the population. It was also Beyer who the or ized that the present Filipinos had a Malayan culture. Jocano, on the other hand, believes that fossil evidences of ancient men show that they came not only to the Philippines but to New Guinea, Java, Borneo, and Australia, and that there is no way of telling whether or not they were Negritos. But whether they were Negritos or not is not of great moment, what concerns us is that there is positive proof that man was in the Philippines at least as early 21,000 or 22,000 years ago. The discovery in a Tabon cave in Palawan in 1962 of a skull cap and a portion of a jaw, presumed to be those of a human being, shows conclusively that man came earlier to the Philippines than to the Malay Peninsula where, according to the old the ory, the Filipinos came from. As to the present Filipinos, Indonesians, and Malays of Malaysia, Jocano maintains that they are the “end results of both the long process of evolution and the later... movements of people. They stand co-equal as ethnic groups, with¬ out any one being the dominant group, racially or culturally.*** Culturally, it is likewise erroneous to state that Filipino culture is Malay in or ientation. Even our historical experiences arid social or ganization differ from those of the people identified as Malays.” The differences, according to Jocano, are due to the differences in their responses to their environment. On the other hand, the similarities found among them are due to the adjustment to their environment. Summarizing his findings, Jocano maintains that * * 1.

They stand co-equal as ethnic groups, with¬ out any one being the dominant group, racially or culturally.*** Culturally, it is likewise erroneous to state that Filipino culture is Malay in or ientation. Even our historical experiences arid social or ganization differ from those of the people identified as Malays.” The differences, according to Jocano, are due to the differences in their responses to their environment. On the other hand, the similarities found among them are due to the adjustment to their environment. Summarizing his findings, Jocano maintains that * * 1. The peoples of prehistoric Island Southeast Asia belonged to the same population. * * * It grew out of the combination of human evolution which occurred in Island Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago, as evidenced by the fossil materials recovered from dif¬ ferent parts of the region, and of the movements of other, peoples from Asia mainland during historic times. * F.

T: core population shared • a common cultural or ientation that in cluded both flake and core imple¬ ments and their complex ceramic in dustries... Other shared cultural elements consist of similar or naments, pendants, house types, belief systems, ritual complex, and funerary practices. 3. The configuration of these shared elements into a common way of life is what we call the base culture. It emerged from similar responses people made to similar geographical conditions, climate, fauna, and flora.* * * 4. None of these ancient men could be categorized under any of the historically identified ethnic groups (i. e., Malays, Indonesians, Filipinos) to day. The West¬ ern colonizers were the ones who fragmented the pop¬ ulation into ethnic groups as they partitioned the region into their respective colonies. * * * The British popularized, in scholarship, the term Malay to characterize the group of people they encountered in the Malay Peninsula. The Portuguese, the Germans, and the Dutch in troduced the Indonesians to the Western world. The Spaniards strongly worked for the conversion of Filipinos (for merly Indios) to Christianity. Later on the Americans came and further differentiated the Filipinos from their Southeast Asian cousins. 5... the explanation of the peopling of the Phil¬ ippines through a series of waves of migration, as documented by folk history like the Maragtas, has to be reconsidered. The undue credit given to the Malays as the or iginal settlers of the region and dominant cul¬ tural transmitter must be corrected. * * * Emerging from a common population with the same base culture, the Malays, the Filipinos, and Indonesians are coequal as ethnic groups in the region of Island Southeast Asia, with out any one of them being racially or culturally dominant. Introduction of Islam.-The spread of Islam to Old Malay¬ sia was brought about by the activities of the Arab traders, missionaries, and teachers who in troduced their religious beliefs among the Malays. The foundation of Islam was laid in Malay¬ sia by the Arabian scholar Mudum, who arrived in the Malay Peninsula about the middle of the 14 th century. He succeeded in establishing in Malacca a rather tenuous foothold for Islam. BEFORE THE CONQUEST 23 About 1380, he proceeded to Sulu and preached the doctrines of Mohammed. In 1390, Raja Baginda, one of the petty rulers of Menangkabaw, Sumatra, arrived in Sulu and promptly converted some of the natives to Islam. His religious activities were fol¬ lowed by Abu Bakr who, about 1450, left Palemb&ng for Sulu. He married Raja Baginda’s daughter, Paramisuli, After Ba¬ ginda’s death, Abu Bakr exercised his powers as sultan and estab¬ lished a government patterned after the Sultanate of Arabia. Islam spread rapidly to all parts of Sulu. y In Mindanao, Serif Kabungsuan, who had meanwhile arrived from Johore with his men, immediately began laying the founda¬ tions of Islam. He converted many tribes to his religion and, having married into an in fluential family, made himself the first sultan of Mindanao. From then on, Islam spread rapidly to the Visayas and Luzon. The arrival of the Spaniards in the second half of the 16 th century and the subsequent conquest of Luzon led the Muslims to retreat to the south where they maintained their in dependence from for eign powers to the end of the Spanish regime. Relations with the Orang Dampuans.—Between 900 and 1200 A. D., another group of immigrants came to the Philippines from southern Annam. Known as Orang Dampuans or Men from Champa, they established trading posts in Sulu, resulting in a flourishing trade between Sulu and Southern Annam. The Orang Dampuans were not politically minded and had no in ten¬ tion of dominating the people of Sulu, who were called Bura- nuns. Their in terest lay in trade. As usually happened, the Orang Dampuans, because of their in creasing prosperity, aroused the jealousy of the Buranuns who, in a fit of anger, massacred some Orang Dampuans. The latter, who had superior weapons, took their bloody revenge on the Buranuns and, having leveled the enemy’s villages to the ground, sailed to their homeland. It was not until the 13 th century that the Orang Dampuans returned to Sulu to trade peacefully with the natives. Relations with Bapjarmasin.—The fame of Sulu reached as far as northern Borneo and soon Banjarmasin and Brunei, two of the important sub-states of the Empire of Sri Vijaya, sent traders to Sulu. The latter’s famous pearl beds drew the in terest of the Banjarmasin merchants and adventurers. Thus, regular trade relations were established between the people of Sulu and the men of Bapjar, as the men of Banjarmasin were 24 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE called.

Realizing the power of a beautiful woman to soften the heart of a hostile ruler, the men of Banjar brought •their beautiful princess to Sulu. She was of fered to the Buranun ruler, who did not need a second look to decide that the princess was fit to be his queen. Sulu thus came under the in fluence of Banjarmasin* and in no time the Buranuns fotmd the mselves willing tribute payers to Banjarmasin. With Sulu now under their thumb, the men of Banjar sent more adventurers and traders to Sulu until, as time went on, the Buranuns were slowly pressured into the hinterland, leaving the coasts to the wily men of Banjar. Under the latter, Sulu developed into an emporium, and trading ships from Cambodia, China, Java, and Sumatra cast anchor at Sulu ports to savor their wealth and splendor. From the union of the Buranun chieftain and the Banjar¬ masin princess came the rulers of Sulu. For many years there¬ after, Sulu remained under the in fluence of Banjarmasin. Relations with China.— From scanty records that have come down to the present, it is known that the Philippines had some commercial relations with the neighboring countries, particularly with China. Trade relations with the latter started in the 9 th century when some Arab traders who were barred from the Central China coast found an alternative route starting from Malacca and pacing through Borneo, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Goods from Southeast Asia and the western world were carried by the Arab traders to the Philippines through the southern route. Philippine goods, on the other hand, were brought by Arab ships to the Chinese mainland through the port of Canton. During the rule of the Sung Dynasty (960-1127) in Chinai Chinese goods began to flow in a continuous stream into the Philippines. Chinese colonies were founded in the coastal to wns of the archipelago. During the Ming period (1368-1644), other colonies were established in the hinterland. By the middle of the 14 th century, however, other countries of Asia had begun to take an active in terest in Philippine trade. Cambodia and Champa, in Indo-China, trade their porcelain products for Philippine wares. A little later, Annam, Siam and BEFORE THE CONQUEST 25 Tonkin also began to trade with the Philippines. So keen was the competition that from 20% to 40% of the to tal trade with the Southern Philippines was non-Chinese. Keen commercial rivalry lasted up to the Javanese or Madjapahit period (1377- 1478). The Chinese regained control of the Philippine trade when the Ming emperor, Yung Lo, (1402-1424), came'to the throne of China. Yung Lo sent a large fleet consisting of more than sixty vessels to the Philippines under the command of Admiral Cheng Ho. The fleet visited Lingayen in Pangasinan, Manila Bay, Mindoro, and Sulu. These visits took place in 1405-06,1408-10, and 1417. For a short period, the Chinese Emperor even tried- to maintain a kind of sovereignty over Luzon and sent Ko-ch’a-lao to the island as “governor”. With the death of Yung Lo, however, his pretensions to suzerainty over Luzon came to an end. In the 15 th century when Islam began to spread to the southern Philippines, the Indo-China trade suffered a setback and the Chinese traders, pressed back by the Muslims, sought new trading routes to those parts of the Philippines where Islam had not yet gained a foothold. Later on, the Chinese were allowed to trade with areas under the sway of Islam. The Ten Bornean Datus.—The Malay settlement of Panay in the Visayas is told in the Maragtas, which is legendary or at least semi-historical. In the 13 th century, about the time that m Sulu was undergoing a transformation owing to the paramount in fluence of Banjarmasin, Borneo was seething with discontent. It appeared that Sultan Makatunaw was mistreating his subjects, so that ten of the chieftains (or datus) decided to leave for un¬ known parts in search of freedom. With their families, Datus Puti, Bangkaya, Dumalugdog, Sumakwel, Lubay, Paiburong, Dumangsil, Balensusa, Paduhinog, and Dumangsol secretly sailed in their balangays with out any definite destination. After days of sailing, the Bornean datus reached Panay which at the time was in habited by the Negritos called Atis, who were ruled by their brave chieftain, Marikudo, and his wife, Maniwantiwan. Real¬ izing that the Atis suspected them of evil in tention, Datu Puti, the leader of the Bornean datus, assured them of their peaceful in tentions. All they wanted, he explained, was to buy land where he and his men and families could settle peacefully. Mari¬ kudo, after consulting with his elders, decided to sell his land to the newcomers. The purchase price was ridiculously low — a 26 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE gold salakot and, to satisfy feminine vanity, a long gold necklace for Maniwantiwan. ‘ As was customary, a feast was held, after which Marikudo and his people retired to the in terior. With the datus and their families firmly settled in Panay, Datus Puti, Balensusa, and Dumangsil sailed northward to Luzon, disembarking in the region around Lake Bonbon (Taal). The fertility of the soil led Dumangsil and Balensusa to found a settle¬ ment there, while Puti, satisfied that his men were leading peaceful lives, returned to Borneo. In the course of time, Dumangsil and Balensusa’s families spread out to the neighboring regions now known as Laguna and the Bicol Peninsula. As for the seven datus in Panay, they, too, prospered. They divided the island into three districts: Hantik (now Antique), under Datu Sumakwel; Irong-Irong (now Iloilo), under Datu Paiburong; and Aklan (now Aklan or Capiz), under Datu Bangkaya"

The Alleged Code of Kalantiyaw.—It may be presumed that there were “laws” or, more accurately, or ders promulgated by ranking chieftains, for in any community, no matter how pri¬ mitive, “laws” or “or ders” were promulgated by the chieftains and/or a council of elders. It has been alleged that about 1433 the third chief of Panay, Datu Kalantiyaw, probably a descendant of Datu Sumakwel, issued or ders for the guidance of his people. This so-called Code of Kalantiyaw is a disputed document 1 but its contents may be of some in terest to the readers:* * I.

Chinese Influences.—The long contacts of the Filipinos with the Chinese, beginning with the tenth century of the Christian era, in evitably led to Chinese cultural penetration of the Philip¬ pines. Chinese in fluences on Filipino life were mainly economic, 29 BEFORE THE CONQUEST for the Chinese who came to the islands were “economic” men whose in terest lay in profits rather than in political domination. Except perhaps for a short period, the Chinese never had any political designs on the Philippines. An examination of the Philippine languages, particularly. Tagalog, reveals hundreds of words directly appropriated from the Chinese. The following table shows some of the words in Tagalog which have their or igins in Chinese: Chinese Tagalog am am am-pau ampaw a-chi ate bah-tu-tai batutay bi-hun bihon bi-koe biko bi-wo bilao bi-thai bithay di-kiam dikyam gu-a guyi he-bi hibi hok-bu hukbo in-kong in gkong ka-tai katay ke-tiau katyaw ko-a kuya lau lawlaw lau-lang - ' c •' lelang le-piah lipyi lun-pia lumpiya loh-soa lusong ma-mi * mami mi-ki miki mi-soa miswa pan-sit pansit sang-le sangla chien-si siyansf From the Chinese, too, the ancient Filipinos learned the use of umbrellas, gongs, lead, porcelain, the manufacture of i 30 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE gunpowder, mining methods, and metallurgy. Equally important was the adoption by the Filipinos of some Chinese customs. The ancient custom of arranging the marriages of children by the parents was probably of Chinese or igin. So is the employment of a go-between to negotiate marriages. Among the ancient Visayans, mourning was shown by wearing white shirts or dress, a custom that is definitely Chinese. Indian Influences.—The Indian in fluences on Filipino life are primarily reflected in the Philippine languages, particularly in Tagalog. While it is not always safe to reconstruct past events solely from the study of language, yet the latter of fers a method of in ferring the development of man’s thought through years of changes. The large number of terms of Sanskrit or igin does not necessarily mean that there was direct contact between the ancient Filipinos and the Indians. The paucity of archeological or written documents to prove the existence of such relationship places in doubt the the ory that there was, once upon a time, direct contact between the Filipinos and the Indians. More probable is the the ory that the Filipinos imbibed some of the elements of Indian culture through the Hinduized Malays who came to the Philippines to settle permanently. Dr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, in his study of Sanskrit- loan words in Tagalog, classifies these loan-words into “those which signify in tellectual acts, moral conceptions, emotions, superstitions, names of deities, of planets, of numerals of high number, of botany, of war, of titles, some animals, in struments of in dustry, and the names of money.” The following words, taken at random, represent the “borrowings” from Sanskrit, the ancient language of India: Sanskrit Tagalog kshama aksaya ahi ah as swamin asawa bhaga bahagi bhara bahala vartta balita bhattara bathala taruna katalona katha katha koti <10,000,000) kati BEFORE THE CONQUEST 31 kotta kuta dala (net) dala dhrta dalita jay a dayang ganda ganda artha halaga hari hari ina ina laksha laksa lalarawa lalawa lekha likha maha mahal maharddhika mahadlika mana mana mandala mandala tara tala Sanskrit words are also encountered in Visayan and Magin- danao. In the latter, they deal primarily with government, re¬ ligion, and commerce. Some such words are agama (religion), sumbahayang (prayer), surga (heaven), batara (god), guru (teacher), dusa (sin), pandita (scholar or priest), baginda (emperor), raja (king), laksamana (of ficer of state), surat (book), sutra (silk), mutya (pearl), tumbaga (copper), bara (measure), kunsi (lock), and many others. Indian in fluence was also present in the ancient religious beliefs of the Filipinos. Among the Muslims, Indra Batara was the most prominent mythological figure, Indra being the Indian king of heaven. The other gods which the Muslims believed in were of Vedic or Indian or igin. It is the refore probable that the ancient paganism of the Filipinos, which amounted to demon and spirit worship, came from India through Old Malaysia. Some of the ancient customs which have survived the in roads of Western imperialism find their counterparts in India. It may be in ferred that those customs were of Indian or igin.

In the wedding ceremony of the Philippines, the Cord and the Veil ceremonies are the remains of ancient symbolism practised in both Hindu and Muslim weddings to this day. With modifications, the symbolism is the same. A Hindu bride and groom will exchange garlands of sampaguita and their shoulder and head scarves will be tied to gether during the ceremony. In a Muslim wedding, an or nate silken cloth will be placed over the bridal couple and a knotted garland of flowers placed over their heads. What is more significant, however, is that the Cord and Veil ceremonies are apparently not part of the Catholic rites of marriages observed in Rome or Spain, but one unique to the Philippines. * * * 3 EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES Before the coming of the Spaniards the Filipinos had a civilization of their own. The various aspects of this civilization doubtless came partly from the Malays who settled in the country and partly from a response to the new environment. The customs and traditions, the government and mode of living have, to a great extent, come down to the present and may be found in remote rural areas which have so far succeeded in resisting the impact of modern civilization. For this reason, many of the customs and practices of the pre-colonial Filipinos are still operative in many parts of the country, a circumstance that is, in a sense, advantageous for it of fers an observer first-hand materials for the reconstruction of the distant past. Clothing.—Among the ancient Filipinos, the male at tire was composed of the upper and lower parts. The upper, called kanggan, was a black or blue collarless jacket with short sleeves. It seems that the color of the jacket in dicated the rank of the wearer, for the chief wore a red jacket, while those below his rank wore either blue or black depending upon their position in society. The lower part of the at tire, called bahag, consisted of a strip of cloth wrapped about the waist, passing down between the thighs. Such method of dressing naturally left one’s thighs and legs exposed. The woman’s dress, too, was composed of the upper and lower parts. The upper, called bard or camisa, was a jacket with sleeves, while the lower part, called saya by the Tagalogs and patadyong by the Visayans, was loose skirt. A piece of red or white cloth, called tapis, was usually wrapped about the waist. Men, women and children walked about barefooted, for sandals and shoes were Spanish in novations. The male had a head- gear consisting of a piece of cloth, called putong, which was wrapped around his head. The color of the putong showed the “manliness” of a man; a red putong for in stance, signified that the wearer had killed a man in war. « But he who had killed at 33 34 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE least seven was privileged to wear an embroidered putong. The woman, on the other hand, had no putong, but wore her hair gracefully knotted at the back of her head. Ornaments.—The early Filipinos had a weakness for personal adornment, for women, as well as men, burdened the mselves with such trappings as armlets called kalumbiga, pendants, brace¬ lets, gold rings, earrings, and even leglets. These or naments were made of gold, which was abundant in the mines and rivers, and precious stones. Since gold was a common commodity, the ancients made good use of it not only by turning it into rings, armlets and bracelets, but also into fillings between the teeth. The fillings were made to adorn their teeth, not to cover up a decayed to oth. The adornment of the body was made not only by wearing costly and heavy jewels, but by tattooing it with various designs. Even women were so tattooed about their bodies and faces that they appeared to be preparing for a masked ball in a carnival auditorium. The tattoo, then, was a form of or nament to en¬ hance the beauty of the man or woman. But it had another function, namely, to exhibit a man’s war record. The more tattoos a man had the more he was looked up to in society, for his numerous tattoos were, in a manner of speaking, his war medals. Among the ancient Filipinos, the Visayans were the most tattooed people, compelling the early Spanish writers to call them the Pintados or painted ones and their islands Islas del Pintados or Island of the Painted People. Whether their superabundant display of tattoos was a sign of bravery or sim¬ ple vanity is hard to say. It may be presumed, however, that the most tattooed man was both vain and brave. Houses.—If one goes to the nearest barrio or village, one will see the ancient Filipino house. This is because the average barrio house is constructed along a plan that or iginates from ancient times. There is basically no difference between the present barrio house and the ancient Filipino one. Neither time nor for tune, it seems, has wrought significant changes in the dwelling of the rural folk. Built to suit the tropical climate, the ancient house was made of wood, bamboo, and nipa palm. Antonio de Moiga, a Spanish jurist and chronicler, described the average house as he saw it at the beginning of the 17 th century:1 ^‘Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas”, in Blair and Robertson, The Philip¬ pine Islands (Cleveland, 1904), Vol. 16, pp. 117-118.

EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 35 The houses and dwellings of all these natives [Filipinos] are universally set upon stakes arigues (i. e., columns)2 high above the ground. They are built and tiled with wood and bamboos, and covered and roofed with nipa-palm leaves. Each house is separate, and is not built adjoining another. In the lower part are enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and cattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends into the house by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which are made from two bamboos. Above are their open batalanes (galleries) used for household duties; the parents and children live to gether. There is little adorn¬ ment and finery in the house, which is called bahandin. Among the descendants of the Indonesians, such as the Ilongots and the Kalingas of northern Luzon and the Mandayas and the Bagobos of Mindanao, the houses were built on tree tops, presumably to prevent their enemies from surprising them in a raid. On the other hand, the Bajaos, or Sea Gypsies of Sulu, made their houses in their boats, for they were a sea-roving people whose life depended upon the wealth of the seas. Social Classes:—Philippine society was divided into three classes: the nobles, the freemen, and the dependents.3 The nobles, consisting of the chiefs and their families, wielded tre¬ mendous in fluence in the barangay and enjoyed rights that were not usually enjoyed by the other members of society. In the Tagalog region, they usually carried the title of Gat or Lakan, as in Lakan Dula or Gat Maitan. Next to the nobles were the freemen, called mahadlika by the Tagalogs. They were com¬ posed of free men and likewise of dependents who had earned their freedom. Occupying the lowest stratum were the depend¬ ents, known as alipin among the Tagalogs. A dependent ac- 2 The term arigues is the Hispanized form of the Tagalog haligi or post. So is bahaque, which is the Tagalog bahag. 3 It has been customary for the Spanish writers and for Filipino writers in fluenced by them to classify society into nobles, freemen, and slaves. Reading carefully the accounts of Antonio de Morga and Juan de Plasencia, one gets the impression that the so-called slaves were not actually slaves in the European sense, but dependents. Even to day, in some places, such dependents exist, yet it had not been proper to call them slaves. John Leddy Phelan, in his book The Hispanization of the Philippines (Madison, 1959), p. 20, correctly points out that “To call the pre-Hispanic system of labor or ganization slavery, as the Spaniards in variably did, is misleading. The whole arrangement had much more in common with debt peonage and share- cropping than it did with the European of chattel slavery.” 36 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE quired his low status in society by in heritance, by captivity in war, by failing to pay his debts, by purchase, or by committing a crime for which he was duly sentenced. It must be noted, however, that the lines drawn between the classes were not hard; any member of the social classes could go up or down the social ladder depending upon the at tendant circumstances. Among the Tagalogs, the dependents were either aliping namamahay or aliping sagigilid. The namamahay had his own family and house and served his master during planting and harvest seasons, rowed for him, helped in the construction of his house, and served his visitors. The sagigilid, on the other hand, had no property of his own, lived with the master, and could not even marry with out the latter’s consent. Among the Visayans, dependents were of three kinds: the tumataban, the tumarampuk, and the ayuey. The first worked for his master when summoned to do so; the second worked one day for his master; and the third worked three days for his lord. There were gradations among the dependents. The full dependent was the son or daughter of dependent parents. The half-dependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom was a full dependent and the other a freeman. The quarter- dependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom was a half dependent and the other a freeman. The Position of Women.—Women before the coming of the Spaniards enjoyed a unique position in society that their de¬ scendants during the Spanish occupation did not enjoy. Cus¬ to mary laws gave them the right to be the equal of men, for they could own and in herit property, engage in trade and in dustry, and succeed to the chieftainship of a barangay in the absence of a male heir. Then, too, they had the exclusive right to give names to their children. As a sign of deep respect, the men, when accompanying women, walked behind them. * Marriage Customs.—There was a custom, not so strictly followed, in which a man belonging to one class married a woman of the same class. Thus, a chief married a woman of his rank; a noble that of his class; and the dependent that of his status. Nevertheless, this custom was not rigid, and it was possible for a noble to marry a dependent or a woman of the chieftain class, and a dependent to marry a woman outside his rank. A man’s wife was his legitimate wife and was called asawa, while the other women were euphemistically called “friends”. EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 37 Only the children of the wife were regarded legitimate and legal heirs, whereas the children of the other women or “friends” were not considered legitimate and, the refore, barred from in¬ heriting any property from the illegitimate father. It took patience and a spirit of dedication on the part of a man to win the hand of his fair lady. For the custom of the period, a custom that has persisted to this day in some remote areas, required that he serve the girl’s parents for months and even years. He chopped wood, fetched water, and did chores required of him. He was not supposed to talk to his fair lady; only their eyes met occasionally to exchange mute messages of love"

He chopped wood, fetched water, and did chores required of him. He was not supposed to talk to his fair lady; only their eyes met occasionally to exchange mute messages of love. There was no chance for them to meet clandestinely, for the girl was zealously guarded by the parents or by the grand¬ parents, who were always on the lookout for any sign of mis¬ chief on the part of the suitor or their girl. After having satis¬ fied the mselves that the suitor would make a good son-in-law and husband, the parents finally gave their consent to the mar¬ riage. But first the man must meet several conditions. The first was to give a dowry, called bjgay-kaya, consisting of land, gold, or dependents. In the absence of these, any valuable article would do. Next the poor man must also give the bride-to-be’s parents a certain amount of money, known as panghimuyat,4 as payment for the mother’s nocturnal efforts in rearing the girl to womanhood. Another form of “bribe” called bigay-suso, was to be given to the girl’s wet-nurse who fed the bride during her in fancy with milk from her own breast. Not only this; the man must also give the girl’s parents another sum of money, called himaraw, as reimbursement for the amount spent in feeding the girl during her in fancy. Among the Zambals, there was another “bribe” that the man must give to the girl’s relatives. It was called sambon. The girl’s parents arranged all these payments not directly with the suitor, but with his parents. It was not an easy matter to make such arrangements, for it usually happened that the suitor’s financial status was such that he could not comply with the wishes of the girl’s parents. It was the duty of his parents to haggle and to make the final arrangements for the marriage 4 A word composed of the prefixes pang- and king-, now an obsolescent prefix, and the wordbase puyat.

This state of the courtship immediately before the marriage was and is still called pamumulungan or pamamalae. The marriage ceremony differed according to the status of the contracting parties. Among the nobles, a go-between was employed by the groom to bring the bride to him. With a lance, the go-between fetched the bride from her house. Having ar¬ rived at the foot of-the groom’s steps, the bride pretended to be coy and bashful and would refuse to ascend the stairs. The groom’s father then gave her a gift to persuade her to go up into his house. The bride then obligingly ascended and having enter¬ ed the house now refused to sit down. Another gift was given her. She refused to eat or drink and consequently the groom’s father had to shell out something for her. Groom and bride now drank from one cup. At this stage, an old man announced that the ceremony would begin. An old priestess then made her bow to the guests and, taking the hands of the couple, she joined them over a plate of uncooked rice. With a shout she threw the uncooked rice to the guests. The latter responded with a loud shout and the ceremony was over. Marriage among the freemen was different in that the rice ceremony was omitted. Among the dependents, marriage was consummated with out benefit of clergy. It was as simple as, “Will you marry me?” And if the woman agreed then they were considered man and wife. The marriage customs of the Muslims were similar to those of the in habitants of Luzon. In the first stage of courtship, known as panalanguni, or betrothal, a group of tribesmen of the groom paid the girl a visit. The spokesman announced the mar¬ riage proposals to the girl’s parents, who immediately consulted with their relatives. The decision was relayed to the village chief who, in turn, in for med the suitor’s parents of the decision. Once accepted, the second stage was set. It was called pedsungud or settlement of the dowry. The village chief had a hand in this, for he actually handled the negotiations with the groom’s parents. The dowry was of seven kinds: (1) the kawasateg, consisting of a rather big amount to be given to the close relatives of the bride; (2) the siwaka, consisting of brassware or a few hundred pesos to be given to those who had helped in arranging the wedding; (3) the enduatuan, consisting of brassware or money or animals to be given to the village chief; (4) the pangatulian, consisting of jewelry to be given to the girl’s mother EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 39 and aunts; (5) the tatas, consisting of a blade to be given to the girl’s uncle; (6) the langkad, consisting of a special sum of money to be given to the girl’s parents as a sort of fine for having by¬ passed the elder sister of the bride, if she had any; and (7) the lekat, consisting of an amount equivalent to ten or more pesos to be given to the girl’s at tendant. With the questions about the dowry resolved to the satis¬ faction of the girl’s parents and relatives, the third stage was set. This consisted of the wedding festival known as pegkawing. The ceremony was held at the home of the village chief. The groom was fetched by an elder from the girl’s family and car¬ ried to the home of the village chief amidst dances and music. Cheerers accompanied the groom. The girl was then fetched by a member of the groom’s family and brought to the chieftain’s home amidst the same cheers and dances. The bride and the groom then sat facing each other. The hadji or judge read the so-called in struction to the couple. This finished, the groom walked three times around the bride, stopping now and then in a desire to lift the veil from the bride’s face. This was accom¬ panied by the shouting and laughter of his companions, for it was they who decided when the groom would lift the veil"

After a time, they finally gave the signal for the lifting of the veil, and the groom, taking his cue, slowly lifted his bride’s veil. The hadji then read the marriage ritual, and holy water was sprinkled on the couple. The wedding ceremony was followed by six days of festivities. Not until the seventh night was the groom allowed to spend the night with his bride. Mixed Marriages.—Tf the married couple belonged to dif¬ ferent classes, say, a freeman and a dependent, their children were equally divided among the parents in so far as social status was concerned. Thus, if the father was a freeman, the eldest, the third, the fifth, the seventh, and so on, whether male or female, belonged to the father. The second, the fourth, the sixth, and so on, belonged to the mother. Since in this case the father was a freeman and the mother a dependent, all children belonging to the father became freemen and those belonging to the mother became dependents. But in case there was only one child the latter became half-free and half-dependent. If there were an odd number of children, say nine, the ninth child became half-free and half-dependent. - Inheritance and Succession.—Among the ancient Filipinos, the legitimate children automatically in herited the property of 40 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE their parents, even with out a written will. The property was divided equally among the children, although either parent might show a little partiality in giving a favorite son or daughter an extra jewel or a few pieces of gold. But if the father gave any of his sons a dowry in or der to be married to a chieftain’s daughter and the amount of the dowry exceeded the to tal amount given to the other sons, “the excess was not counted in the whole property to be divided”. Things given in advance to any son or daughter, unless expressly considered by the parents as outside the property to be in herited, were in terpreted to be part of the in heritance of the recipient. In cases where there were children by a free unmarried woman, aside from the legitimate children, the for mer were considered natural children if begotten after the father’s first marriage. The natural children did not share the father’s property equally with the legitimate children. The latter were given two parts, while the remaining part was given to the natural children. In the absence of legitimate children, the natural children in herited all the property of the father. If a man had legitimate children as well as children by a dependent, the latter did not in herit anything, but it was the duty of the legitimate to free the dependent woman and to give something to her children. In the absence of heirs, however, the property of the couple went to their nearest relatives. In matters of succession, the first son of the barangay chieftain succeeded his father; if the first died with out leaving an heir, the second son succeeded as chieftain. In the absence of any male heir, the eldest daughter became chieftain. Government.—The barangay was the unit of government and consisted of from 30 to 100 families. The Tagalog word barangay was derived from the Malay balangayy a boat, which transported them to these shores. Each barangay was in dependent and was ruled by a chieftain. There was no king in those days, although some chieftains were more powerful than others and consequently respected by the other chiefs. The multiplicity of barangays implies that there was no national or central govern¬ ment. It was the primary duty of a chieftain to rule and govern his subjects and to promote their welfare and in terests. What he received from them must be kept well and venerated. The subjects served their chieftain during wars and voyages and helped him in the tilling and sowing of the land and in the construction of his house. They paid tributes, called buwis, to their chieftain in the form of crops. The chief’s descendants and other relatives EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 41 were highly regarded in the barangay and were considered nobles who were exempted from tributes and services. A chieftain had wide powers, for he exercised all the functions of government. He was the executive, the legislator, and the judge. He was, naturally, the supreme commander in time of war. The in ter-baranganic relations consisted in carrying on commerce between barangays and in agreements concerning friendship and alliance. A treaty of friendship and alliance was concluded by means of the blood compact or sangduguan in which the contracting parties drew blood from their arms and mixed the blood thus drawn with the wine in a cup. The con¬ tracting parties then drank from the same cup, the reby making them “blood-brothers”. Wars between barangays occurred when a man from one barangay went to another and was murdered with out any ob¬ vious cause. Another cause of war was kidnapping the wives of men belonging to one barangay. Still another cause was the maltreatment of men of one barangay by men of another ba¬ rangay. In these three causes of war there seemed to have been very little or no at tempt at all to reconcile conflicts, and the resolution of the conflict was brought about by force. Vengeance was the motive power that drove the men of the barangays to cut each other’s throat. Laws.—Laws were either customary or written. Customary laws were handed down or ally from generation to generation and constituted the bulk of the laws of the barangay. The written laws were those that the chieftain and his elders promulgated from time to time as necessity arose. Only a few of the written laws, among them the so-called Code of Kalantiyaw and the Muslim laws, have come down to the present because many of them were destroyed by the early Spanish missionaries and many more destroyed by the elements. The laws, customary and written, dealt with various sub¬ jects, such as in heritance, divorce, usury, partnership, crime and punishment, property rights, family relations, adoption, and loans. Criminal laws dealt with felonies, or major crimes, and minor crimes"

Criminal laws dealt with felonies, or major crimes, and minor crimes. A recidivist or habitual criminal was punished more severely than the one who committed a first of fense. Major crimes were rape, in cest, murder, witchcraft, in sult, trespassing, 42 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE sacrilegious acts, and larceny. A man guilty of any of these crimes was punished by death or by a heavy fine. Minor crimes, on the other hand, consisted of such misdemeanors as adultery, cheating, petty theft, perjury, disturbance of the peace of the night by singing, and destroying documents owned by a chief. These misdemeanors were punished by exposure to the ants, by a small fine, by flogging, by cutting the fingers of one hand, or by swimming for a certain number of hours. The punishments meted out to the guilty party may appear barbarous to contemporary man. It must be remembered, how¬ ever, that the period was “contemporaneous” with ancient Ba¬ by lon, Egypt, and Greece, whose laws were as “barbarous” as, if not more so, than those of the ancient Filipinos. Apparently, the ancients, whether Filipino or European, did not believe in endangering society by letting loose a gang of thieves or reci¬ divists, whose manners could no longer be improved. How a Law was Made.—When a chieftain of a barangay wanted a law enacted to prevent, say, the commission of serious or minor crimes, he called in the elders of the community and told them what he had in mind. The elders approved his plan, for it was meant to protect society from the in cursions of the bad elements. The chieftain then made the necessary regulations or rules, which the elders immediately approved. A public announcer, called umalohokan, was summoned and or dered to go around the ba¬ rangay to announce the promulgation of the new rules and regu¬ lations. With a bell in one hand, the umalohokan called the at tention of the subjects by ringing the bell furiously. The people gathered around him and heard from him the provisions of the new law. Anybody violating the law was promptly arrested and brought before the chieftain to be judged according to the merits of the case. Judicial Process.—Disputes are in evitable in any society, and Filipino society before the arrival of the Spaniards was not an exception. But disputes in the latter case were usually, though probably not always, decided peacefully through a “court” composed of the chieftain as judge and the barangay elders as “jury”. Conflicts arising between subjects of different barangays were resolved by arbitration in which a board composed of elders from neutral barangays acted as arbiter. Trials were held publicly and decisions were rendered promptly, the reby avoiding what is now known as “justice de- EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 43 layed.” Probably because there were no lawyers at the time, all trials were conducted efficiently and with out any delay. The accuser and the accused faced each other with their respective witnesses. The latter, to show their honesty and sincerity, took an oath to this effect: “May the crocodile devour me if I tell any falsehood”, “May the lightning strike me if 1 don’t tell the truth and nothing but the truth”, “May J die here and now if I tell a lie”, “May the sun and the moon frown upon me”. It was as simple as that; there was no Bible to put one’s right hand on, unlike to day when the Bible is not taken seriously by those who swear by it. The disputants then began presenting their arguments, but¬ tressed by the testimonies of their respective witnesses. The chieftain listened at tentively and the elders took ment al notes of the arguments. The disputant with more witnesses to his side was adjudged the winner. Naturally, not a few losers con¬ tested the decision. In this case, the chieftain, acting as judged and executive, enforced his judgment by siding openly with the winner and compelling the defeated party to respect the judg¬ ment of the honorable court. Under such circumstances, the defeated party had no other recourse than to bow before the in evitable. Trial by Ordeal.” The medieval European had no mono¬ poly of the trial by or deal, for the ancient Filipinos practised it under certain circumstances to determine the guilt of a person. The trial by or deal was resorted to in or der to show that God in His in finite wisdom always took the side of the in nocent. Several or deals were adopted to determine the in nocence or guilt of a party. The first consisted in or dering the suspects to place a stone in a vessel with boiling water and compelling them to dip their hands into the vessel to take out the stone. The suspect who refused to obey the command was regarded as the culprit. If the suspects made the at tempt as or dered, the man whose hand was scalded the most was considered the guilty one. The second consisted in giving lighted candles to the suspects. The man whose candle unfortunately died out first was regarded as the guilty party. The third consisted of or der¬ ing the suspects to plunge into the river or lake with lances. He who came to the surface first was considered guilty. The fourth consisted in or dering the suspects to chew uncooked rice.

Religious Beliefs.-The ancient Filipinos believed in the immortality of the soul and in life after death. Their rituals were based on beliefs in a ranking deity whom they called Bathalang Maykapal and a host of other deities, in the environ¬ ment al spirits, and in soul-spirits. The Bat hath the equivalent of the Spanish Dios, was supposed to be the creator of the earth and man and the refore superior to all other deities. These deities had their functions in relation to the daily life of the believers. Thus, they had a god of agriculture whom they called Idiyanale; a god of death, Sidapa; a rainbow god, Balangaw; a war god, Mandarangan, a fire god, Agni, a god of the other world, Mag¬ way en; a goddess of harvest, Lalahon; a god of hell, Siginarugan; a god of love, Diyan Masalanta; and scores of other deities with their respective functions. Disease or illness was at tributed to the temper of the en¬ vironmental spirits and the soul-spirits of the dead relatives. The Filipinos adored the sun and the moon, animals and birds, for they seemed to consider the objects of Nature as something to be respected. Thus they worshipped a kind of blue bird called tigmamanukin and another, the crow. Even the lowly croco¬ dile had its share of veneration and all talked to it with such awe and veneration that the believers went to the extent of imploring it not to harm them. Consequently, to reinforce their supplications they threw a part of what they had into the 5 Another version of the or deal is practised in some parts of Manila and the provinces. A shallow basket (hilao) is pierced through at one edge with the blades of a pair of scissors. A finger of one man or woman holds one handle of the scissors, while another holds the other handle. The basket is now hanging and a man, holding a Bible, says: “Jesus, Marla y Josef; Jesus, Maria y Josef: Did Juan steal the money? Jesus, Marfa y Josef, did Juan steal the money? Did Juan steal the money?” This is repeated several times. If the basket turns around, Juan is adjudged the thief. Here is an in stance of paganism consorting with Catholicism! EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 45 water for the lucky crocodile to gobble. Old trees, too, which were not even fit for firewood, were believed to be “divine” and nobody in his right senses would dare cut down such re¬ lics of old age. Since the reefs, the rocks, and the crags were also revered, the ancients left dishes and kitchen wares on them. At other times, they shot their arrows into the cliffs jutting into the sea in or der to make their passage easy. Thus the ancient Filipinos venerated almost any object that was close to their daily life, in dicating the importance of the relationship between man and the object of Nature. The veneration of the soul-spirits was universal among the ancient Filipinos and may be termed the “Cult of the Dead”. They kept alive the memory of their dead relatives by carving idols of stone, gold, or ivory which they called likha or larawan. The memory of the recently dead relative was revered as if he were alive, so that the previous relationship existing between them was continued to a certain extent even after the death of one of them. This “special” relationship was rooted in the belief that the spirit of the dead would be of fended if food and wine were not shared with him and, having been of fended, the spirit of the dead would take vengeance on the living by causing disease or illness. Like the modems, the ancient Filipinos adored idols called anito in Tagalog and diwata in Visayan. The anitos roughly correspond to the present saints. Like most Filipinos to day, the ancients of fered prayers and food to their anitos; for safe nav¬ igation or a good catch the ancient fishermen of fered food and prayer for the anito of the sea; for good harvest they of fered food to the anito of the fields; for good for tune to a new-born babe they in voked the anito of the house, and so on. The anitos, however, were not necessarily and exclusively good. Some of them-were deemed bad and, the refore, their enemies. But whether good or bad, the people of fered prayers and sacrifices to them: to the good in or der to win their good¬ will; and to the bad in or der to placate their anger. The sacri¬ fices were performed by priests or priestesses called baylana or katalona, and consisted of food, wine, pigs, and gold. The sacrificial ceremony was performed in the following manner:6 The priestesses dressed very gaily with garlands on their heads, and are resplendent with gold.

Burial.— Belief in life after death and in the relation be¬ tween the dead and the living made the ancient Filipinos re¬ spectful of their dead. The deceased relative was placed in a wooden coffin and buried under the house, complete with cloth, gold, and other valuable things. This was done in the belief that a well-provisioned dead person would be received with alarcity in the other world, while a poorly provided dead one would be received with in difference, if not with hostility. Upon the death of a person, the people made fires under his house. Armed men acted as sentinels about his coffin, for it was feared that some sorcerers might take it into their heads to to uch the coffin and the reby open it, thus releasing the accumulated stench of the corpse. There was much weeping not only on the part of the immediate relatives, but also among the friends and even neighbors. To accentuate the depth of their mourning, the relatives of the dead man or woman hired professional mourners to chant, for the benefit of all and sun¬ dry, the alleged good deeds and achievements of the dead. As personal manifestation of mourning among the people of Luzon, the relatives wore white shirts or skirts. Among the other tribes of Luzon and Mindanao, the relatives showed their deep mourning by going berserk. Sometimes they wore rattan bands around their arms, legs, and necks. Usually, the mourning relatives abstained from eating meat and drinking wine. The ancients distinguished mourning for a woman from that of a man. The for mer was called morotal; the latter, mag- lahi. Mourning for a dead chief was called laraw, which was observed with more for mal ceremony than that of the or dinary mortal. When a chieftain died, the event was immediately re- EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 47 layed to the whole barangay. Taboos were the reupon imposed and anybody who had the courage to violate any one of the taboos courted disaster: he was punished by a huge fine, or by death, or by being made a lowly dependent. With the death of the chieftain, all wars or pretty quarrels, if there was any, were or dered stopped; spears were carried with the tips point¬ ing earthward; daggers were carried with hilts reversed; singing in the boats coming from the sea or river was prohibited; and the wearing of loud clothes tabooed. An enclosure was made around the house of the dead chieftain and anybody who trespassed on this enclosure was punished. The superabundant display of lamentations ceased after the funeral. However, eating and drinking continued* and the higher the rank of the deceased the more eating and drinking there was. The relatives of the dead fasted and limited their nutrition to vegetables. Among the Tagalogs this fasting was called sipa. Were the dead man a victim of foul play or had he died in battle, the mourning was not ended until after any of the relatives had exacted his vengeance. This act of avenging the death of a relative was known as balata. Normally, the ninth night after the death of a person was celebrated and was — and is still — known as pasiyam. The activities connected with the pasiyam, such as staging a play in honor of the dead, were called tibawan, and the play so staged was called tibaw. Divination and Magic Charms.—The ancient Filipinos, like their contemporaries in many lands, put very much stock in divination, auguries, and magic charms. They in terpreted signs in Nature, such as the flight of birds, the barking of dogs, the singing of lizards, and the like, as good or bad omens depending upon the circumstances. Thus, the howling of a dog in the mid¬ dle of the night presaged tragedy or the death of a person. Sneezing, an or dinary human function (particularly when one has a cold), was considered bad omen and those who, for in¬ stance, were about to go on a journey or to war were admon¬ ished to back out, for surely misfortune would overtake them. On the other hand, when a species of bird called salaksak crossed the path of the warriors on their way to battle it meant victory. As to the future, the ancient Filipinos also had their monumental frauds in the persons of the soothsayers, called pangatauhan, who were allegedly endowed with extraordinary powers to tell the for tune of anybody who cared to know be¬ for ehand what the days ahead had in store for him. 48 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Magic charms played an important part in the life of not only the ancient Filipinos, but also of their descendants, who believed in black magic and sorcerers who could victimize any¬ body at the drop of a putong.

Some Filipinos, however, were lucky in possessing amulets or charms. They were supposed to be in sured against dangers. The anting-anting or agimat in sured a man against weapons of every kind; the gayuma made a man lovable to all the ladies; the odom, a charm similar to the Tagalog tagabulag, made the Bicolano in visible; the Visayan wig a and the Tagalog sagabe (sa gabe) could make the possessor of this charm walk in a storm or swim in a river with out getting wet; and the Bicolano tagahupa was mixed in a drink and made the unfortunate drink¬ er a sort of vassal to the man with the magic potion. These beliefs, religious and otherwise, were not eradicated with the coming of Western civilization. Most of them were practised behind the backs of the Christian missionaries, with the result that side by side with Catholicism, elements of pa¬ ganism survived and penetrated the new religion. Today, in many rural areas and even in some big cities, the practice of Catholicism is a curious mixture of Christian and pagan beliefs, the reby making Filipino Catholicism unique. Economic Life.—Economic life during pre-colonial days was not much different from that found to day in many remote barrios. The significant change is in the tempo of life: during those half-for gotten days, life was placid and characterized by less economic and social pressure than it is to day. Agriculture, then as now, was the main source of liveli¬ hood. There was an abundance of rice, coconuts, sugar cane, cotton, hemp, bananas, or anges, and many species of fruits and vegetables. Land cultivation was, as it is to day, done in two EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 49 ways: the kaingin system in which the land was cleared by burning the shrubs and bushes, after which the land was plant¬ ed to rice and other crops; and tillage. So abundant was the produce of the land that Pxgafetta, the chronicler of the Ma¬ gellan expedition which arrived in the Philippines in 1521, noted that Cebu had such foodstuffs as millet, sorgo, or anges, sugar cane, coconuts, gourds, garlic, lemon, and other fruits. On the way back to Spain after the defeat of the Spaniards in the battle of Mactan, the expedition dropped anchor in Pala¬ wan and found the place abundant with the same foodstuffs as were found in Cebu, aside from sweet potatoes and roots similar to turnips. Significantly, Pigafetta noted cockfighting in Palawan — proof that this sport was not of Spanish or igin, although lator, the Spaniards encouraged the Filipinos to in¬ dulge in cockfighting not only to get more in come from it but also to preoccupy the minds of the Filipinos in such apparently harmless vice in or der to prevent them from thinking of rising against the established or der.7 Productivity was in creased by the use of irrigation ditches, as evidenced by the world-famous Ifugao rice terraces of Moun¬ tain Province. These rice terraces, which are irrigated by a system of ditches, are stone-walled and run for thousands of feet up the mountain sides. From a distance, the whole gives a panoramic effect of a gigantic stairway leading to the sky. If placed end to end, the length would to tal an estimated 12,000 miles or half-way round the earth. There was a system of landholding which was public or private. The less arable lands and those along the mountain slopes were considered public property and could, the refore, be tilled freely by anybody with enough energy and in itiative. The rich and cultivated lands, on the other hand, were considered the private preserve of the nobles and the datus. In some places, there existed what may be termed land rent, in which the cul¬ tivator of the soil paid a certain fee — in kind or in gold — to the chief or datu. Fr. Juan de Plasencia, who wrote on the customs 7 A great majority of the terms now used in cockfighting are Spanish words adopted into the native languages, e. g, ruweda (Sp. rueda), ring or arena; sentensiyador (Sp. oentenciador), referee; pusid (Sp. apuesta), bet: dihado (Sp. dejado), underdog in Me betting, liyamado (Sp. Uamado). upperdog in the betting; kristo (Sp. cristo), professional bet taker: kareo (Sp. careo) confron at ion or cocks when both are mortally wounded; and others. 50 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of the early Tagalogs at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, claimed that — The reason for this [rent] was that, at the time of their settle¬ ment there, another chief occupied the lands, which the new chief, upon his arrival, bought with his own and the refore the members of his barangay paid him for the arable land, and he divided it among those whom he saw fit to reward. The daily food consisted of rice, which constituted, as An¬ to nio de Morga said, “the daily mainstay for the entire country, to gether with boiled fish of which there is an abundance, and pork or venison, likewise meat of wild buffalo or carabao.” Because of the abundance of coconut and nipa palms, the pre¬ colonial Filipinos fermented the sap of these palms and drank it as liquor, as they do in the barrios to day. The fermented sap is called tuba. Said Morga of the propensity of Filipinos to drinking:* * * 8 The natives of these Islands drink this liquor in the day and night with out end in their meetings, weddings, feasts, circles, accom¬ panied by singing by a few who are so in clined and who come to drink and have a good time, although this habit does not carry with it, according to their estimation, any dishonor or in famy"

Drinking tuba, however, did not much affect the brains of the drinker, for as Father Francisco Colin, the Jesuit Chro¬ nicler, said:9 But rarely do they become furious or wild; rather, after drink¬ ing, they preserve their proper respect and circumspection. They only become more gay and talkative and say some amusing things. But it is known that none of ttium after leaving a banquet, even at a late hour of the night, fail to reach their home. Aside from agriculture, the pre-colonial Filipinos had other in dustries, such as poultry, stock-raising, fishing, mining, lum¬ bering and shipbuilding, and weaving. They raised chickens, pigs, goats, carabaos, and small or native ponies. There must have been elephants, too, for the word for this huge animal is present in the Philippine languages, the Tagalog word being ° Antonio de Morga, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinos (Mexico, 1609), re¬ printed with notes by Jose Rizal, Paris, 1890, and translated into English by Encarnaci 6 n Alzona, Manila, Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, 1962, p.248. 9 Rizal’s note, tbid. EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 51 of Malay or igin, namely, gadya. Fishing was a thriving in dustry, for most settlements were along rivers and seas, which explains why those settlements were more advanced than those found in the hinterland. Again, Morga testified:10 Fishing of all kinds of fish in the sea or in fresh waters or rivers and streams, is very greatly in dulged in and is quite productive; in fact, this in dustry is quite general in the entire country and is considered a natural activity for the self-support of the people. There is an abundance of good sardines, bass, sea breams called bacocos, dace eels, bicuda, tanguinge, flounders,... marine crabs and all kinds of mollusks, etc. Various methods were used in catching fish, such as the use of fishing nets, the bow and arrow, fishing spear, wicker basket, hooks and lines, corrals, and fish poison. Pearl fisheries abounded in Sulu, where the richest pearl-beds were found. Mining was comparatively developed before the coming of the Spaniards. Legazpi, reporting to the Viceroy of Mexico in 1569, noted that there was “More or less gold... in all these islands; it is obtained from rivers, and, in some places, from the mines which the natives work.” Speaking of mines, Morga said: Throughout these Islands are certain places where there is an abundance of rich gold deposits and other mineral products which are collected by the natives through washing or placer-mining. However, after the Spaniards had settled in the land, the natives became more lax in mining gold, contenting the mselves with what they already had in the form of jewelry and ancient in gots of gold... In fact, poor and in digent was in deed the one who did not possess gold-chains, bracelets and earrings. In Paracale, in the Province of Camarines, certain placer and other mines were developed and worked. Likewise, in Ilocos, this commodity was also being traded... They have rich mines of gold besides silver... **** The Ilocanos refine and finish gold and market the same through the plains and the country. In the rest of the Islands, there is the same abundance of placer and other mines, particularly in the Visayas, Butuan River in Min- danaw and Cebu, where presently [1590’s] a mine called Talibon is being developed, which yields very good gold. If all the activities and efforts of the Spaniards were concentrated on the develop- To Ibid., p. 255. 52 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ment of gold-mining, there could be obtained from any of these Islands as much gold as from any possessions in the world. Lumbering and shipbuilding were flourishing in dustries in those pre-colonial days when, according to Morga, many Fili¬ pinos were “proficient in building ocean-going vessels.” The abundance of thick for ests teeming with first-class hardwoods and the in sular character of the country probably explain why many Filipinos were good sailors and shipbuilders. The car¬ penters of some settlements were such good artisans that they were not engaged in “any other trade than said occupation.” The shipbuilders constructed all kinds of boats for travel, war, and commerce, boats that the Spaniards later called banco, bc- langay, lapis, caracoa, virey, uinta, and prau. Weaving was a home in dustry in which women not other¬ wise engaged in threshing and pounding palay in wooden mor¬ tars, were experts.

There was for eign trade, too, with China, Japan, Siam, Cambodia, Borneo, Sumatra Java, and other islands of the old Malaysia. A Spanish document of 1586 noted that the Filipinos were “keen traders and have traded with China for many years, ar 1 before the advent of the Spaniards they sailed to Maluco [Moluccas], Malacca, Hazian [Ache?], Parami, Bumei [Borneo], and other kingdoms.” because currency was not then in use, the pre-colonial Fili¬ pinos used the barter system in their business transactions. The EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTIC ES 53 commodities were sometimes priced in tenns of gold or metal gongs. The Chinese traders testified to the honesty of the pre¬ colonial Filipinos who paid their debts dutifully to the truc+ing Chinese upon the latter’s return the following year. The Chinese writers Chao Ju-kua (1209-1214) and Wang Ta-yuan (1349), who gathered the reports of those Chinese traders, had made it known through their works that the pre-colonial Filipinos were scrupulously honest in their commercial transactions. No old Tagalog word exists for the unflattering connotations of cheat, as a verb or as a noun. The present Tagalog word tor it, suwitik, is of Chinese or igin and not, as is commonly supposed, derived from the English adjective Jesuitic. 4 PRE-COLONIAL CULTURE The ancient Filipinos had a culture that was basically Ma¬ layan in structure and form. They had written languages that traced their or igin to the' Austronesian parent-stock and used them not only as media of daily communication, but also as vehicles for the expression of their literary moods. The bulk of their literature was folk literature which represented a group heritage and reflected their daily lives. They had music and dances for almost all occasions and a wide variety of musical in struments in dicative of their in genuity. Languages.--There are more than a hundred languages and dialects in the Philippines, eight of which may be considered major languages. They are Tagalog (made the basis of the Na¬ tion al Language), Iloko, Pangasinan,, Pampangan, Sugbuhanon, Hiligaynon, Samarnon or Samar-Leyte, and Magindanao. These languages are sister-languages whose lexicon shows that they are descended from one parent-stock, the Austronesian or Malayo- Polynesian language. The differentiation into the present number of Philippine languages may have been the result of the necessity of for ming new words and phrases to fit the new environment. Thus, even to day, the lexicon of the Philippine languages contains roots or derivations that are unquestionably Malayan. A com¬ parative study of some of the Philippine languages and Primitive Austronesian shows that the for mer were derived from the latter.

Father Pedro Chirino, writing at the be¬ ginning of the 17 th century, said of the Filipinos: “I found in this language [Tagalog] four qualities of the four greatest lan¬ guages of the world — Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Spanish. It has the mysticism and difficulties of the Hebrew; the distinc¬ tive terms of the Greek not only in the common but also in the proper names; the fullness and elegance of Latin; and the civil¬ ity and courtesy of Spanish,”1 \\ The Filipinos before the arrival of the Spaniards had a syllabary which was probably of Sanskrit or Arabic provenance.

Some pieces of literature, however, have been handed down or ally from generation to generation so that only a glimpse of pre-colonial literature can be had to day. Literature-The literature of the early Filipinos may be classified into floating or oral literature and written literature. The literature of the Tagalog consisted of sabi (maxim), sawi- kam (saying), bugtong (riddle), suliranin and in dulanin (street songs), talindaw (boat songs), diyuna (song of revelry), kumintang (war song which evolved into a love song), dalit and umbay (dirge), tagu np&y, balikungkong, dupayinin and hili- raw (war songs), uyayi and hete (lullabies), ihiman (bridal song), tagulaylay (mournful song), tigpasin (rowing song), tingad (household song), and kutang-kutang (couplets usually chanted by the blind). In most cases the songs were accompanied by dancing, so that che song and the dance, to gether with the drama, developed almost simultaneously. At other times, the verses were recited. There are no extant examples of these songs and verses, but some that have come down to the present had had Spanish in¬ fluences. The following example of a kundiman, very popular in Batangas, has no Spanish in fluence and may be taken as a sample of pre-Spanish song: Hayo na’t dimugin ang bato mongpuso Sa pait ng aking luhang tumutub, Nang ang mail&p mong awa’y nang umamo Sa waldng hangganang tapdt kong pagsuyo. (Let thy hard-heart be softened By my bitter tears flowing, That you may take pity On my sincere and boundless love.)2 The simplicity of the uyayi or lullaby, both in diction and music, is at once charming and sweetly in nocent: Matubg na aking bunso, Ang ind mo ay malayo; Hindi ko namdn masundo. May putik at may balaho. 4 (Sleep now baby, darling, Thy mother is far away; 2 This and other translations are free and represent only the idea, not the “feel” or nuances of the language. 58 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE I cannot fetch her, The path is full of mud and mud-holes.) The kutang-kutang is humorous and shows the light-heart¬ edness of the singer: Kung di kitd kamtat kamtan ka ng ibd, Magbibigti ako ng tali sa pad, (If I don’t win you, but another does, I shall hang myself by the feet). The fact that the ancient Tagalog was quite adept in vers¬ ification is shown not only in the occasional verses but also in the drama. The latter was written in verse, and maxims and proverbs were employed profusely. The plays were staged in open spaces, in the houses of the nobles, and in places of wor¬ ship or sambahan. Staged to the accompaniment of music and the dance, the plays dealt with love, war, legends, the memory of deceased relatives, and war heroes. As such, they were staged on different occasions, and consequently developed into the pagbatiy karagatan, tagayan, pananapatan, sabalan, and tibaw, the last staged on the ninth night following the death of a person. The karagatan, on the other hand, was a sort of debate in verse in which a problem, usually in volving men and women, was resolved with one of the participants receiving the sentence of the “chieftain” or chairman of the occasion. The karagatan later developed, under the Spaniards, into the duplo which, in turn, developed into the balagtasan in 1924 under the American regime. Filipino folk songs and folk tales show the collective mood of the people and constitute, to gether with their sayings, maxims, and proverbs, the wisdom of the race. The following Bontok song expresses wonder and nostalgia:3 I climb the terraced mountain, With the fields of rice on ev’ry hand; And far away to the south and west Lie the hills of Ifugao land. Beyond the hills and woodlands Far away the holy mountains stand. I wonder what is waiting there In that distant Ifugao land. 3 Progressive Music Series, Vol. 2, No. 21. PRE-COLONIAL CULTURE 59 This Igorot ballad shows humor, a rare commodity among the Filipinos:4 * Now that I’m young and pretty You are in love with me I’ll soon be old and ugly So now you’ll marry me. No wedding would be complete with out songs for the occa¬ sion, and the following Igorot chua-ay or wedding song is the counterpart of the Tagalog ihiman: s Manchild brave, manchild strong, For thee we call, oe! oe! Come, oh come, we call thee now, oe! oe! Brave to fight, strong to work, We bid thee to come, oe! oe! Carry rice from field to town, oe! oe! Maranaw literature, like the literature of the other regions, is largely floating and has been, from time immemorial, recited or sung as the occasion arose. Maranaw literature was deeply in spired by Islam, and consisted in tutul (folk tale), tubad-tubad (short love poems), pananaro-on (sayings and proverbs), sowa- $owa-i (drama), antoka (riddle or puzzle), and darongan or epic poetry. The tubad-tubad reads:6 Pupulayog so papas ka pupumagapas apas Ka tulakin kong ko banog Na diron pukatalakin Ka daon kasakriti.

Madale, “The Literature of the Maranaws”, This Week, February 22, 1959. 60 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE (Woe, woe unto me Worried of thinking of a loved one And I cannot let my feelings prevail, express my love, Because every time I want to reveal it Water stops it in its way.) The ancient literature of the Ilocano compares favorably with that of the Tagalog who, like him, had many kinds of song sung on different occasions. Thus, the Ilocano war song expresses the vigor and joy of the warriors coming from battle; the dal-lot, popular among the peasants, was sung during a baptismal party, a wedding, or a feast; the badeng or love song sung during a serenade, the dung-aw or dirge, similar to the Tagalog umbay; and other songs sung during planting, harvesting, and fishing. The following love song, the Pamulinawen, expresses a longing for a loved one with whom the serenader had cast his fate:7 Pamulinawen, Pusok imdengamman Toy umas-asog, agrayo ita sadiam, Panunotemman, dika pagintutulngan To agayat, agrayo ita sadiam. Essem ti diak kalipatan Ta nasudi unay a nagan Uray sadin ti ayant disso sadino manf No malagipka, pusok ti mabang-aran. (Pamulinawen, my Love, please hear Me who am sighing, longing for you; Kindly thou think, kindly do not turn deaf To me who am longing for you. (Forget 1 never can Your most sweet and beloved name; No matter where [I am], if I remember you, My heart leaps with joy.) Both the lyrics and the music of the dung-aw show the sad¬ ness that gripped the mother who had lost another child. She chanted: Ay anakko bunga! Bilbilinenka amat Ta no makitamto ni Kalla, Pakomustaamto koma. 7 Leopoldo Y. Yabes, A Brief Survey of floko Literature (Manila, 1936), pp. 10 et seq. PRE-COLONIAL CULTURE 61 (Ay, my child, my fruit, This I wish to ask of you: Should you ever see Kalla, Extend to her my regards.) It is obvious that this particular dung-aw is a comparatively late version of the or iginal, for the word pakomusta is of Spanish or igin, that is, from como esta. The mother, in this song, ap¬ parently had previously lost a child named Clara (Kalla in the song), and wanted the other child, now dead, to give her best regards to the one in heaven. In such simple words, the song gives one to understand the close family ties that bind the Filipino family. Although by nature lyrical, the Filipinos also wrote sustained poetry. They wrote folk epics which to date number no less than twenty. The Ifugaos of northern Luzon had their folk epics Hudhud and Alim. The Hudhud glorifies Ifugao history, the story centering around the hero Aliguyon. Portions of the Hudhud were usually sung during wedding feasts and on other festive Occasions. The Alim, on the other hand, deals with the gods and resembles the Indian epic Ramayana. The Ilocanos had Biag li Ixim-ang (The Life of Lam-ang), whose or igins dated from the pre-Spanish period. The Lam-ang at tained, however, its full development durinb the Spanish period and if the Ilocano scholar is to be believed the epic now in cludes the jeep as a means of transportation, meaning, of course, that the Lam-ang is still growing by accretion. The Muslims, another hardy people, had several darangans or epics, of which the Bantugan, Indarapatra and Sulayman, and Bidasari are the most notable. These epics have been handed down or ally from generation to generation and to day old men recite them from memory. The Indarapatra ends with the following lines:8 So great Indarapatra lived in state, And taught the simple arts Of farm and field. He taught the huntsman’s tricks, Iiie herdsman's lore; He taught the fisherfdk To call the winds. 8 Translated by Frank Lewis Minton. 62 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE He taught the use of iron, How to make the kris, The long sword, and boning. He taught the farmer Better ways to sow And reap; The women to weave. He showed them healing herbs, Made potions for their easements, And magic charms To save them from the Gods And Diamonds of the depths. Music and the Dance.—The Filipinos are bom musicians, for they easily learn tunes by ear. Many Filipinos who play two or more musical in struments have never been in music academies, nor have they any knowledge of the musical nota¬ tions except what they know by ear. This in born quality they in herited from their ancestors of pre-Spanish days who were the mselves somewhat accomplished musicians. Pigafetta, the chronicler of the Magellan expedition, noted that the Filipinos of Cebu had such percussion in struments as the timbal, the timbrel, the cymbal, and a kind of drum. Much later, in 1543, Bernardo de la Torre, one of Villalobos’ of ficers, at tended a dance in Samar and saw a stringed in strument known as the kudyapi, a kind of small guitar. The kudyapi, which the later Tagalog adopted as the symbol of poetry, seemed to have been a popular in strument, for it was found almost throughout the country — from the north to the south. Among the Negritos of Bataan and Zambales, the favorite musical in struments were the Jew’s harp made of bamboo; the bansic made of mountain cane with four holes; a bamboo violin with abaca strings; and the gangsa, a sort of guitar. With these musical in struments, the Negritos danced their favorite “Potato” dance in which a man was represented as stealing sweet potatoes in the field"

With these musical in struments, the Negritos danced their favorite “Potato” dance in which a man was represented as stealing sweet potatoes in the field. Other dances were the “Torture” dance executed to commemorate the capture of an enemy and in which a group of men danced around the supposed captive; the “Duel” dance represented by a pair of warriors staging a fight with bolos, bows and arrows; and the “Lover’s” dance in which a man danced around a woman who kept her feet in time with the music. The Bontok Igorots of northern Luzon had various musical in struments: a Jew’s harp made of bamboo or brass; a bamboo PRE-COLONIAL CULTURE 63 flute; the abafii, a primitive Malay musical in strument; and the gangsa, an in strument struck with a skin-covered drumstick. With these musical in struments, the Bontok Igorots sang and danced to the tune of their Mang-ay-u-weng, a laborer’s song, the Mang-ay-yeng, Mang-ay-lu-kay, ang the Ting-aw. The Tagbanuas of Palawan also had their musical in stru¬ ments like the Jew’s harp, the drum with sharkskin heads, the bamboo flute, the guitar with abaca strings, and brass gongs. One of their most colorful dances was the macasla, performed during the macasla festival. The macasla was a kind of mixture used in fishing. The effect of the mixture upon the poor fish is much like that of the dynamite. The name of the dance was taken from the name of the mixture. It was not only on festive occasions that the Tagbanuas sang and danced, but also on the occasion when a person was sick. The Tagbanuas beat their gongs and drums and danced to the sounds made in the belief that the music thus produced drove the evil spirits from the sick man’s body. Upon the death of the sick man, however, his relatives and friends sprinkled ashes around the body, believing that the soul would leave footprints on the ashes on its way out of the body. This done, they danced around the corpse, singing a dirge in honor of the dead. The Ilocanos had many songs to fit different occasions and, like their brothers in the different regions, possessed many musical in struments. Among these were the kutibeng, a sort of guitar with five strings, the flute, and the kudyapi. One of the favorite Ilocano dances was the kinnotan, or ants’ dance, in which a group of dancers gesticulated to ward a person being at tacked by ants and then made the motion of scratching the man. Another Ilocano dance, the kinnallogong, showed a man and woman facing each other, with the man remaining stationary and the woman singing and dancing to ward him. With a hat in one hand, she at tempted several times to put it on the man’s head and, having succeeded in doing so, she danced with the man. The Visayans were known to be good folk dancers and musicians. They, too, possessed musical in struments found in other places in the Philippines, in cluding drums, timbrel, a violin¬ like in strument with metallic strings, and a sort of flageolet. Two of their most famous dances, the balitaw and the dandansoy, are popular even to this day and have won honors as among the best folk dances in the Philippines. In the balitaw, a man 64 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and a woman faced each other singing a love ditty. The girl, pretending coyness, at first refused to listen to the man’s plead¬ ings, but as they danced to gether the woman changed her mind and finally accepted the man’s love of ferings. Among the Tagalogs, the dance and the music developed almost simultaneously with the drama, for the drama could not be staged with out music and dancing. As «? uch, the music and the dance ramified into the balatong, dalit, hiliraw, kutang- kutang, lulay, in dulanin, kumintdng, salampati, tagulaylay, sub If, barimbaw, and tagaydn. The kumintdng was a characteristic Batangueno dance and music which did not find much popular favor outside Batangas province. But within the limits of the province, it was a favorite dance and song, so much so that up to 1732 the whole province was known by this dance — la pro- vincia de Kumintdng. Among the Tinguians, the kalaleng was a favorite in stru¬ ment. It was a nope flute and used by a young man in serenading his lady love. The object of the serenade in turn took out her musical in strument, the diwdiw-as, a pan-pipe musical in stru¬ ment made of five or seven bamboo reeds. She responded by playing on this in strument and the tunes played on both in stru¬ ments showed the status of the young man’s pleadings with the girl. If the girl played a tune that showed encouragement, the y^ung man played a flippant tune; if not he played a melan¬ choly tune. It should be noted that the ancient Filipinos had music and dances for all occasions and that because of their frequent association their social or ganization was more well-knit than it is to day. Looking backwards, one may say that during the Spanish empire days the Filipino social or ganization remained substantially as it was before the conquest, but under the im¬ pact of American in fluence that same or ganization has suffered a little loosening of the social ties.

With the coming of the Bronze Age, implements were manu¬ factured in bronze, and shapes and sizes improved considerably. Bello, drums, and gongs made of bronze in dicate the development of such social arts as dancing and music. In the Early Iron Age, the artistic variety of the ancient Filipinos reached its apogee. Ornaments with different forms and sizes began to appear, burdening the body not only with rings, bracelets, armlets, strings of beads and headbands but also with the tattoos of various designs. Metal and glass came into use* With the in troduction of the hand loom, woven tex¬ tiles with different designs and colors came to be worn. The simple weapons, such as daggers, swords, bolos, knives, spears, and other bladed weapons, were manufacture with artistic designs on their handles. Pottery with in cised designs was made, while images made of wood, bone, ivory, or horn, were carved, to be used not only in their daily life, but also after death, for the ancients buried the implements and some earthly possessions of the deceased with them. As clothing became common, tattooing gave way to embroidered garments. To this day, in some parts of the Philippines, but particularly in the north and in the south, these embroidered garments, done in various artistic designs and in lively colors, are still sworn. There were several in fluences on Filipino primitive art which are apparent in the surviving artifacts. The Negrito in fluence is seen in the zigzag designs on ancient lime tubes and in the orna¬ ment al carvings on combs. The Indonesian in fluence is apparent in the apparel of the Kalingas of Luzon, the Maranaws of Lanao, and the Manobos and Bagobos. Malayan in fluence is traced in the wood-carving found in utensils, boats, and wooden shields of the people in Sulu and Mindanao and in the Mountain Province.* The in fluence of Islam is clearly seen in the or namental and decorative art of the Lanao Muslims. The Muslims are not in terested in figures, for the Koran prohibits them from making human representations. Muslim decorative art is graceful and rhythmical. Galo B.

V. H.

The Lanao people or nament their houses and boats with elaborate carvings, all brilliantly painted in contrasting, yet harmonious colors, further of fset by the use of both white and black. The floor-beams of the houses project beyond the walls, and the ends, or panolong, are carved and multi-colored. Finely- carved panels are also placed above the windows and doors and all show such color combinations. The boats, too, are carved from prow to stern; even the paddles are carved. The metal-work, - as on kris and dagger hilts and scabbards, betel-nut boxes, vases, etc., — is generally in laid in silver and gold on black. Gold and silver rings and bracelets are studded with little mounds of metal, surrounded with loops, sometimes a lace, of fine metal threads, in terspersed with tiny flowers and stars. While Muslim art deals generally with plant and geometrical designs, Ifugao art deals generally with animhl and human re¬ presentations. Most of the Ifugao carvings are utilitarian: utensils such as the wooden bowls, spoons, forks, and smoking pipes are polished and embellished. The probable reason why the Ifugao wood carver had — and still has — a special predilection for human and animal representations is that he was, and is, a polytheist, having more than a thousand gods. He had an aversion to plant and fish forms, for his religious beliefs prohibited him from eating various vegetables and fish during the observance of certain ceremonies. These vegetables and fish were believed of fensive to his gods and, the refore, he avoided representations of such objects. Samples of Ifugao art may be had in any curio shop in Manila and Baguio, but the Ifugao carvings now on sale are greatly commercialized and do not really represent the profound feeling of the humble artist. 10 A.

PART II THE SPANISH PERIOD UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN The most spectacular change during the Renaissance which shaped the course of history was the opening of the world to European shipping. Propelled by “Gospel, Gold and Glory,” and supported by much-improved technology — new types of ships, sailing charts and maps, navigational in struments, gunpowder, and superior high-powered arms — the two Iberian superpowers of Spain and Portugal pushed through their ultimate goals to discover the rest of the world. With the accumulation of wealth, political authority, additional empirical knowledge in science and technology, and the support of a small economic elite, they were able to finance several daring reconnaissance enterprises in vast unknown, undiscovered seas, and untouched, uncharted con¬ tinents. With momentous maritime discoveries, the hitherto terra in cognita of Asia, with her diverse ancient civilizations and cultures, was in tegrated with Europe. Thus, in the arduous and lengthy process of maritime discovery in the late fifteenth century, new sea lanes to Southeast Asia were charted which led to the spice trade route. The first of these was in itiated by Portugal by sailing via the southeastern route which made break-throughs into the Indian Ocean in 1488 and ended with the fall of Malacca (1511) and the Maluku or the Moluccas (1512). The second was led by Spain by sailing via the western or southwestern route that made serendipitous landfalls in the West Indies in 1492 and culminated in the “rediscovery” of the Philippines in 1521. East Meets West.— Making the food more palatable to the most discriminating medieval tastes triggered the search for spices of all sorts: pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger which were in digenous to the East. Spices accented the bland taste of meat and fish, while preserving them, in the absence of refrigeration. So expensive were spices like black pepper that it could even buy land, pay taxes, liberate a city, even pay dow¬ ries. As Fernand Braudel commented: “Everything depended on it, even the dreams of the fifteenth century explorer.” In the eleventh century, pepper was even meticulously counted out by pepper¬ corns, and when dried, cinnamon and ginger were weighed with 69 70 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE windows shut lest the wind blew away their smallest priceless parti cles. Besides spices, gold, slaves, silver and silk spurred men to trade in these highly-regarded commodities which brought them great wealth. Merchants suddenly became important in the eyes of the people, and they not only became richer but also powerful in the more famous trading cities of Italy. Gold and silver not only funded but also expanded the jewelry trade of rare pearls and rubies from far-away India. The in clusion of Asian trade to that of Europe led not only to the flow of economic products and the wealth of Asia to European societies but also to the dynamic in teraction of cultures. The tremendous profits European trade brought to nation states, particularly Portugal and Spain, in tensified European rivalries for the fabled source of Oriental products. This required the in ter¬ vention of the only known power in European relations — the Pope. The Lusitanian-Hispanic Rivalry in Maritime Discoveries.— Portugal was the first country to use in novation in seamanship and boatbuilding with the establishment by Henry “the Navigator” of the first navigational school in the globe at Sagres Point in 1419. Between 1451 and 1470, the Portuguese discovered and colonized all the islands of the Azores in the Atlantic which they used to stage the discovery of the Americas and the circumnav¬ igation of the west coast of Africa. Propelled by their undying zeal, the Portuguese pursued the dream of reaching the East using a direct all-water route. By the turn of the fifteenth century, two of her in trepid explorers had reached the southernmost end of Africa, and later, to India, thus winning the race to the wealth and spices of the East. Spain, however, had earlier dispatched the first truly moment¬ ous exploration in modem times. Inspired by the Florentine map- maker Paolo Toscanelli to discover westward sea route to India, Christopher Columbus (Cristoforo Colombo) in stead made a land¬ fall in Guanahani (earlier identified as San Salvador but in 1986 as Samana Cay) Island in October 1492, and two weeks later, on the coast of Cuba. His voyage, however generated misapprehension and dispute between Spain and Portugal. King John (Joao) of Portugal protested on the ground that it was an in cursion by Spain of his sphere of in fluence. Pope Alexander VI mediated between the two powers. Elected barely two months earlier, this Spanish pope from Valencia, who sired the notorious Cesare UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN 71 and Lucrezia Borgia, issued in May 1493, the Inter caetera and the Eximiae Devotionis, giving Spain the right over any lands newly- discovered by Columbus equivalent to the Portuguese territories found along the western coast of Africa. The perceptive Portu¬ guese, however, realizing the Spanish pope’s bias, did not readily agree tcf the established demarcation line. Instead, they worked for its revision to reduce the area of the territory granted to the Spanish explorers in the New World. The spheres of in fluence of the two superpowers of the fifteenth century thus, were finally fixed by an imaginary line drawn from the north and south poles, a hundred leagues (one Spanish legua = 5.57 kilometers) from Spain, west of the Cape Verde Islands (on the coast of present Senegal, in the western¬ most tip of Africa). The lands lying to the east of the line were reserved for Portugal, and those territories to the west to Spain. Both nations agreed to propagate the tenets of Christianity in their newly-found lands. In 1494, the treaty of Tordesillas was signed which partitioned the non-Christian world into two spheres of in fluence. It faith¬ fully followed the papal bull of 1493 granting the New World to Spain, while Africa and India were reserved only for Portugal. However, the treaty shifted the demarcation line 370 leagues farther west, thus assigning Brazil to Portugal. This was a veritable Portuguese gain. The Magellan (Magalhaes) Expedition (1518-1521 ).—Fer- dinand Magellan (Femao de Magalhaes), a Portuguese serving the Spanish royalty, saw action for his country in the East, first in India with Alfonso de Almeida in 1505, and with distinction, in the fall of Malacca in 1511.

The Magellan (Magalhaes) Expedition (1518-1521 ).—Fer- dinand Magellan (Femao de Magalhaes), a Portuguese serving the Spanish royalty, saw action for his country in the East, first in India with Alfonso de Almeida in 1505, and with distinction, in the fall of Malacca in 1511. His or iginal suggestion of reaching the Maluku (the Spice Islands) by sailing westward was rejected by his King. After seven years of active' service in the East, he returned to his home country and then fought-in the North African campaign against the Moors. It was Ruy Faleiro, a bril¬ liant cosmographer, who egged him to serve Spain as he was then not in the good graces of Lisbon court. In 1518 he convinced Charles V that he could find a shorter way to the Maluku by sailing westward via the Americas. As part of a reconnaissance voyage in 1511-12, Magellan had visited the Spice Islands. Magellan received royal in struction to sail directly to the Maluku and to bring back a cargo of the priceless spices. Thus began “the greatest of all epics of human discovery” when he sailed from San Lucar, Spain, in 1519, on board five very antiquated ships 72 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE with a. crew of 235 men. Skirting unknown and uncharted lands, he sailed around the southern tip of South America, across the vast Pacific Ocean after 9 B days of sailing northwestward. Magellan finally reached the Philippines on March 17, 1521. In Mactan, he was defeated and killed in battle in April 1521 as a conse¬ quence of his in tervention in a dispute between Lapulapu and Zula, chieftains of Mactan. Only one ship, in fact the smallest of them, the Victoria, completed the voyage back to Spain in 1522, arriving in Seville, led by Juan Sebastian del Cano. A mere eighteen Europeans and four Malays survived, thus leaving 170 of “the or iginal expedition lost on the way.” Other survivors were retrieved later by subsequent expeditions. The expedition was a test of human endurance. Food was the most serious and perennial problem, as by the time they were in the immense Pacific, Magellan’s men were compelled to eat worm-in fested powdery biscuits soiled by rats, sawdust, and sea-soaked leather. Lack of Vitamin C resulted in rampant deaths among the crew members due to scurvy. Magellan did not live to see the final completion of the “first- known voyage in history to circumnavigate the globe.” It was through this trip that the Europeans first learned of the existence of the Philippines. It also proved that the earth was round; it established the vastness of the Pacific Ocean; it proved that the East Indies could be reached by crossing the Pacific; and finally it showed that the Americas was really a land mass entirely sepa¬ rate from Asia. Maluku and the Philippines.- -Three Spanish expeditions followed Magellan’s, this time sailing from Mexico, which had become a Spanish colony — the Saavedra (1527-29), the Villa¬ lobos (1541-46), and the most successful of all, the Legazpi expedition (1564). As a sequel to the Magellan voyage, a large fleet of seven ships, with a crew of 450 under the joint command of Garcia Jofre de Loaisa and Juan Sebastian del Cano, left La Coruna, Spain, in July 1525, to claim Maluku for the Spanish crown. By October 1526, the expedition reached Mindanao where they bartered rice, fruits, chicken, and coconut wine with the Filipinos. However, both commanders met death in the Pacific, and the ill-fated expedition, led by Hernando de la Torre, waited for the necessary assistance from Spain. From Zihuatanejo, the first voyage to the Pacific fitted from the Americas sailed on the eve of All Saints’ Day in 1527 UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN 73 under the command of Alonso de Saavedra Ceron, with a squadron of three ships and a crew of some 115 men. Among his in struc¬ tions in cluded the discovery of the Mexican-Maluku route via the Pacific Ocean and the release or search for, if any, survivors of the Magellan, Loaisa, and Cabot (1526) expeditions. Saavedra reached what is probably now known as Lanuza Bay, overlook¬ ing Tandag (Surigao del Sur) by February 1528, following Magel¬ lan’s sea route. The Spaniards vividly reported that “Maluarbuco” in northeastern Mindanao was rich in gold, chickens, wild pigs and coconuts; the women were described as beautiful and the men fair-complexioned. All of them sported long hair, used weapons such as iron cutlasses, cannons, long arrows and blow- guns tipped with poisoned herbs, and wore cotton corselets in war. They performed blood-brotherhood ceremonies with their new friends and allegedly sacrificed, sometimes, humans, and of fered food and drink to their anitos. They recognized Catunao (Si Katunaw?) as their chief. Saavedra, never returned to Mexico as he died on the high seas. Treaty of Zaragoza (1529).—In 1529, King Charles V ceded his alleged rights to Maluku to John III of Portugal for 350,000 ducats, not knowing that they rightfully belonged to the Por¬ tuguese area of responsibility as provided ror in the Treaty of Tordesillas, truly an evidence of the lack of proper geographical knowledge on both parties. A line of demarcation was drawn from pole to pole, this time at 297 V 2 leagues east of the Maluku, which was agreed upon as the western limit of Spain’s colonial ownership. In view of the treaty, the Spanish goal in the “West” was limited only to the Philippines. Thus, for quite some time, the Hispano-Lusitanian rivalry for hegemony in Southeast Asia would stop. Villalobos Expedition (1542-1546).—Under the able command of Ruy Lopez de Villalobos, six ships and some 370 men, departed from Juan Gallego (Navidad), Mexico, in November 1542. By early 1543, they reached the eastern coast of Mindanao.

However, probably the greatest contribution of the Villalobos expedition was the naming of Tandaya or Kandaya (Leyte) in 1543 as Las Phelipinas in honor of then crown-prince Philip II, by Bernardo de la Torre (Capitan Calabaza”), com¬ mander of the ship San Juan de Letran. Legazpi-Urdaneta Expedition (1564).-\"Exactly twenty-two years since Villalobos set sail from the same port of Juan Gallego, four vessels of rabout 350 men sailed for the Philippines in 1564. By February 1565, Legazpi reached Cebu and contracted blood compacts with Si Katunaw and Si Gala at Bohol. In April of the same year. Villa de San Miguel, later changed to Ciudad del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus, after the discovered Santo Nino of Cebu, became “the first Spanish town established in the Archi¬ pelago” and the pioneer permanent settlement in the Philippines. Legazpi was specifically in structed to bring back to Mexico samples of Philippine-grown spices; to discover the return route to Mexico; and to abide by the 1529 Zaragoza treaty not to proceed to Maluku. Indeed,/the spiralling of the price of spices in Spain had been considered by some writers as one of the significant factors that pushed the Legazpi voyage. Fr. Andres de Urdaneta, Legazpi’s chief pilot, whose expertise of the seasonal winds he had acquired while with the Loaisa expedition, discovered the “Urdaneta Passage” on his return to Navidad via the Pacific. This unique sea lane was subsequently used by the Manila-Aca- pulco galleons until the nineteenth century. This was, with out doubt, the most important mission of the Legazpi-Urdaneta expedition. The Making of the Spanish “Indio”.—It was very easy, in deed, for Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who was granted by King Philip II, the peerless and single title of “Adelantado de Filipinas” to accomplish an almost “bloodless” conquest of the Philippines considering its physical and human geography. There existed on the eve of the coming of the Spaniards fragmented units of islands and islets of various sizes separated by numberless bodies of water, as well as multiple ethnolinguistic groups, mostly animistic, and in the south, Islamized. Thus, with Filipino society split into numerous disunified barangay units, it was impossible to put up an effective armed resistance against the well-equipped and prepared conquistadores. Not only did the Sword help in the UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN 75 pacification of the in dios, but above all, the Cross, represented by the different regular missions that came from 1565 to 1606, also helped to mould the natives in the Hispanic image. “En cada fraile tenia el rey en Filipinas un capitan general y un ejercito entero”(“In each friar in the Philippines, they had a captain and a whole army”), as one Mexican Viceroy put it. Thus, with the permanent colonization by Legazpi, the in dios lost the freedom they earlier enjoyed. Political Institutions.--The hierarchical political set-up of the Philippines during the Spanish regime may be seen in the political in stitutions established by the colonial power. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was a captaincy-general administered by the Spanish king through the viceroyalty of Nueva Espana (Mexico). All Spanish possessions were governed by the Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias (Royal and Supreme Council of the Indies) eastablished in 1524 by Charles V. It was, next to the King, the paramount lawmaker and administrator over¬ seeing the colonies of the Spanish empire, guided basically by a compendium of laws first compiled in 1681 called the Recopila- cion de leyes de los reynos de las Indias. The Ministerio de Ultra¬ mar (Ministry of Colonies), by May 1863, had supplanted the Consejo de las Indias. Bureaucracy m the colonial Philippines may be divided into different levels of administration, from the central or national, provincial, city, municipal, and barrio levels. On the national level with its seat of power in Manila, (Intramuros), the King, through the Consejo de las Indias, governed through his sole spokesman and representative in the Philippines, the gobernador y capitan-general. As Captain-General of the colony, the gober- nador-general was commander-in-chief of the army and the navy. He was also president of the Real Audiencia (Supreme Court), the island’s highest judicial body, and as vice-real patron, he had the power over ecclesiastical appointments in the church and even the right to supervise mission work.

The corregimientos or unpacified military zones 76 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE (like Mariveles, Mindoro and Panay) were headed by the corregi- dores. Not only did the alcalde mayor exercise executive and judicial powers, but he also had the special privilege of engaging in trade through the in dulto de comercio (a privilege of alcaldes enjoyed between 1751 to 1844, when it was finally abolished) except in the provinces of Tondo, Cavite, and Zamboanga, to name only a few. Only a Spaniard could be an alcalde mayor or a corregidor. He exercised multiple prerogatives as judge, in spector of en- comiendas, chief of police, tribute collector, and even vice-regal patron and captain-general of the province. Thus, not only was he the executive and judicial authority but he was also the military authority in his area of responsibility, answerable solely to the Governor General and the Real Audiencia in Manila. The annual salary of an alcalde mayor before 1844 ranged from P 300 to P 2,000, and after 1847, from PI,600 to PI,500, according to class. However, with the in dulto de comercio, he earned considerably more, for as comerciante, the Filipinos were for ced to do business with him (they bought from his store), and he engaged in usurious money-lending practices. In 1840, it was re¬ ported that some of the alcaldes may ores' positions were valued at P 50,000 per annum. All the complaints of the Filipinos against the abuses of the alcaldes may ores were somewhat relaxed by the Reform Decree of 1886 when the civil governor became the executive provincial of ficial and the alcalde was reduced to a municipal judge, thus transforming the provincial governor from a “merchant-governor” to a “judge-governor”. By the end of the seventeenth century, there were only six cities or villas established in Luzon and the Visayas: Manila, Villa Femandina (Vigan), Nueva Segovia (Lal-lo, Cagayan), Nueva Caceres (Naga), Cebu, and Arevalo (also called Villa, Iloilo). Cities were governed by the ayuntamiento or city government for med in 1889. In 1894, there were eight ayuntamientos: Manila, Iloilo, Cebu, Jaro, Batangas, Albay, Nueva Caceres, and Vigan. The Manila cabildo (city council), for example, consisted of one or two alcaldes or dinarios who were elected by the Spanish residents of villas; a number of regidores (councilors); an alguacil mayor (chief constable) who maintained peace and or der, and the escribano (secretary) who kept the records of the city government. The Residencia (1501-1799) and the Visita (1499-ca. 18 th Century).—To check the abuse of power of royal of ficials, two UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN 77 ancient Castilian in stitutions, the residencia and the visit a, were transplanted into Philippine soil. The residencia, dating back to the fifteenth century in Spain, was first resorted to in the Indies (Spanish possessions in Amerasia in cluding the Philippines) in.1501. It'was the judicial review of a residenciado (one judged) conducted at the end of his term of of fice, supervised publicly by a juez de residencia. Imposed on a residenciado found guilty - of public misconduct were either heavy fines, sequestration of properties, or imprisonment, or, a combination of all three penal¬ ties. The residencia continued until 1799 when it was of ficially abolished in the colonies. r The visita differed from the residencia in that it was conducted clandestinely by a visitador-general sent from Spain and might occur any time within the of ficial’s term, with out any previous notice. Visitas may be specific or general. A specific visita meant an in vestigation of a single of ficial or a province; a general visita meant an in vestigation of the whole viceroyalty like Mexico or captaincy-general like the Philippines. First applied in the Indies in 1499, the visita had the same objectives as the residencia, that is, to ensure faithful and efficient service on the part of government authorities. Wrongdoers were either fined, dismissed from of fice or expelled from the colony or received a combination of all these punishments. The Filipino Bureaucrats.“On the municipal level, the “little governor” or gobernadorcillo (later replaced by the capitan municipal in 1894), headed the pueblo or municipio. Any Fili¬ pino or Chinese mestizo, 25 years old, literate in oral or written Spanish, and who had been a cabeza de barangay (barrio adminis¬ trator) for four years, could be a gobernadorcillo. This was the highest government position a Filipino could at tain during the Spanish regime, and to gether with the parish priest, his role was considered highly significant in a town. Among his multifarious administrative duties was preparation of the padron (tribute list), recruitment and distribution of men for the draft labor, communal public work (as in the construction and repair of minor bridges) and the quinto (military conscription), postal clerk, judge in civil suits in volving P 44.00 or less. Indeed, he in tervened in all administrative cases pertaining to his town: lands, justice, finance, and the armed for ces. For all these, his yearly salary was P 24.00. The gobernadorcillo was assisted by three super¬ numeraries or in spectors (tenientes de justicia) who supervised matters such as boundaries of cultivated fields (sementeras). 78 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE branding of livestock (ganado) and police (policia); constables (alguaciles); four tenientes segundos; lieutenants of districts (tenientes del barrio), and a secretary (directorcillo).

This was the highest government position a Filipino could at tain during the Spanish regime, and to gether with the parish priest, his role was considered highly significant in a town. Among his multifarious administrative duties was preparation of the padron (tribute list), recruitment and distribution of men for the draft labor, communal public work (as in the construction and repair of minor bridges) and the quinto (military conscription), postal clerk, judge in civil suits in volving P 44.00 or less. Indeed, he in tervened in all administrative cases pertaining to his town: lands, justice, finance, and the armed for ces. For all these, his yearly salary was P 24.00. The gobernadorcillo was assisted by three super¬ numeraries or in spectors (tenientes de justicia) who supervised matters such as boundaries of cultivated fields (sementeras). 78 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE branding of livestock (ganado) and police (policia); constables (alguaciles); four tenientes segundos; lieutenants of districts (tenientes del barrio), and a secretary (directorcillo). Barrio government rested on the cabeza de barangay whose main role was as tax and contributions collector for the gober- nadorcillo. Like the latter, the cabezas were exempted from taxa¬ tion. It was Philip II who conferred upon the barangay chiefs the title of cabezas de barangay to “show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were for merly the lords.” Like the gober- nadorcillo, he was responsible for peace and or der in his own barrio and recruited polistas for communal public works. The Manual del cabeza de barangay (1874) required literacy in Spanish, good moral character, and property-ownership as qualifications for cabezas who served for three year terms. By the mid-nine¬ teenth century, cabezas who had served for twenty-five years were exempted from for ced labor. Hie Amalgamation of Church and State.—It was in the exercise of political and economic powers of the Spanish clergy that we can perceive very clearly the disunity between the Church and State. Hie disgusting features such as church meddling in civil government and press censorship were succinctly pointed out by Filipino laborantes (reformers) as well as revolucionarios in the nineteenth century. In fact, the separation of Church and State became one of the outstanding in novations of the Malolos Constitution in 1898. Ten years before, probably the first and only open anti-friar demonstration against the in to lerable church abuses took place in Manila on March 1, 1888, led by Doroteo Cortes, aided secretly by Marcelo H. del Pilar and Jose Ramos Ishikawa. Encouraged by Article 218 of the newly-passed Penal Code to uching for the right of petition and assembly, a group of in fluential gobernadorcillos, principalesy and residents of Manila boldly marched through the streets of the city to the Ayuntamiento (city hall) demanding the expulsion of friars in the Philippines, in cluding Archbishop Pedro Payo himself, demonstrators’ manifesto declared “Long Live the Queen! Long Live the Army! Down with the Friars/” The high in fluence of the church on the state was exposed by Filipinos, among them Marcelo H. del Pilar who derisively called the situation in the Philippines la soberania monacal (monastic supremacy) or frailocracia (friarocracy), because the UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN 79 Spanish friars or monastic or ders ruled supreme, even over govern¬ ment al matters. Nowhere was the greatest in fluence and complete control of the clergy felt than in the lowest Filipino bureaucratic level — the municipio or pueblo. The parish priest was more of ten than not the only Caucasian and the most important of ficial domi¬ nating the town during the entire span of the colonial period. “The friars were not only the parish priests, or spiritual guides,” as one Filipino put it, “but in effect were rulers of the municipalities; in fact, the whole government of the islands rested on them. Consequently, every abuse of the many which led to the revo¬ lution of 1896-1898 was charged to them by the people.” This keen observation wa& further corroborated by Del Pilar, when he said:... The friars control all the fundamental for ces of society in the Philippines. They control the educational system, for they own the University of Santo Tomas, and are the local in spectors of every -4 primary school. They control the minds of the people because, in a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize the pulpit and confessionals to pubiicly or secretly in fluence the people; they control all the municipal and local authorities and the medium of communication; and they execute all the or ders of the central government... In the national level, the in fluence was exercised through the vast networks of parishes. By the end of the Spanish regime, there were 967 regulars (priests who belonged to a religious or der) manning dioceses in the Philippines, whereas only 675 seculars (priests who did not belong to any religious or der) administered parishes in 1896-98. Probably the most persistent complaint leveled by the Fili¬ pinos against the church was its economic role as landowners, in particular the Dominicans, Augustinians, and the Recollects. It was, the refore, not surprising that the Philippine Revolution centered in the areas where the vast haciendas (friar estates) thrived: Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Morong and Manila province. For example, one-fourth of the to tal area of friar estates in the Philippines was located in Cavite, and 48% of the to tal arable lands in the Tagalog belonged to the friars. $$*$*$* 6 INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE When the Spaniards settled permanently in the Philippines in 1565, they found the Filipinos living in either lineal or nucleated barangay settlements scattered along water routes and river banks (in a pattern of ilayh or upstream and ibaba or downstream) and mountain ridges.

With the reduction, the Spaniards at tempted to tame the reluctant Filipinos through Christian in doctrination in a quite novel settlement pattern using the convento/casa real/plaza complex as the focal point. The reduction, to the Spaniards, was, no doubt, a “civilizing” device to make the Filipinos law- abiding citizens of the Spanish crown, and, in the long run, to make them ultimately “little brown Spaniards,” adopting Hispanic culture and civilization. The more courageous unbelievers among them who rejected Spanish domination, went to the hills and became remontados, cimarrones, ladrones monteses, malhechores or tulisanes in the eyes. of the Spaniards. As part of the strategy of enticing the unwilling unbaptized in dios, the Spanish friars utilized 80 INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 81 the novel sights, sounds, and even, smell of Christian rites and rituals — colorful and pompous processions, songs, candle-lights^, saints dressed in elaborate gold and silver costumes during the May festivals of flores de Mayo or the santa cruzan, the lighting of firecrackers even as the Host was elevated, the sinakulo (passion play), and the Christian versus Muslim conflict drama (moro- moro). Other at tractions in cluded medals, scapularies, cords and rosaries. All these “hypnotized” the spirit of the in dios. Upon baptism, Filipinos were given Christian names usually derived from the feast day of the saint when he was born or baptized, which facilitated identification and recording of population for tax collecting purposes. With the reduction, the precolonial barangays metamor¬ phosed externally and in ternally. External changes in cluded the construction of colonial churches and convents made of stone, some of them appearing like solid for tresses to impress the in dios, as well as the building of private homes of cal y canto (lime and mortar) protected either by roofs of tiles or galvanized iron sheets and provided with a wide azotea and water reservoirs (aljibes). Changes from with out were the consequences of Spanish trade which brought in new cultural elements from the Americans and the Pacific, alongside with a countless in ventory of new Aztec (Mexican) ethnobotanic specimens as com, camote, cassava, to bacco and numerous exotic fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs. The in tegration of Spanish customs and values, Christian¬ ity, and the Castilian language which blended with the local culture, constituted the in ternal changes. I. ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS: A. “Taxation Without Representation”.— Income-generating mechanisms were in troduced by the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines consisting of direct (personal tribute and in come tax) and in direct (customs duties and the bandala) taxes, mono¬ polies (rentas estancadas) of special crops and items as spirituous liquors (1712-1864), betel nut (1764), to bacco (1782-1882), explosives (1805-1864), and opium (1847). The buwis (tribute) may be paid in cash or kind, partly or wholly, as palay or to bacco, chickens, textiles, or even wax and special regional produce, depending on the area of the country. In the 1570 s, the tribute was fixed at eight reales (1 real = 12 M centavos) or in kind or “gold, blankets, cotton, rice, bells” and 82 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE raised to fifteen reales till the end of the Spanish period. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the Filipinos were required to pay the following taxes and other impositions: tribute of ten reales; diezmos prediales (tithes) of one real; town community chest, one real; and sanctorum tax for church support, three reales, to talling fifteen reales. Aside from the tribute, a special tax of V 2 real or rice was collected called samboangan or donativo de Zamboanga to crush the Moro raids (collected since 1635 until the mid-19 th century) and uinta (gathered since 1781 till 1851, with some in terruptions) to equip vintas to shield the coastal areas of Bulacan and Pam- panga. The vinta's counterpart was the falua, collected in Cama- rines Sur, Cebu, Misamis and other littoral provinces. Special privileges of tax exemptions were granted to the descendants of the Filipino chiefly class who served in the paci¬ fication campaigns conducted by the conquistadores, notably Carlos Lakandula of Manila, Pedro Mojica of Cavite, and Rajah Tupas of Cebu. Equally exempted were the laborers of the arsenal and artillery yard of Cavite, the mediquillos (Filipinos who had medical experience but no title), vaccinators and college and university students of Santo Tomas, San Jose, San Juan de Letran and San Carlos (Cebu). Another tax collected was the bandala., Coming from the Tagalog word maridala (a round stack of rice stalks to be threshed), bandala assumed the meaning of the annual enforced sale or requisitioning of goods, particularly of rice or coconut oil, in the case of Tayabas. Pampanga and the Tagalog regions, then the rice bowl of the Philippines, bore the greatest brunt of what amounted to outright confiscation since payment was only. in promissory notes. The Spaniards* debt to the Kapampangans, for in stance, reached some P 70,000 between 1610 and 1616, spiralling up to P 200,000 in 1660, thus sparking a revolt in 1660-61. Pampanga provided an annual bandala of 24,000 fanegas of rice (a fanega is about 2 V 2 bushels) or approximately more than P 6,000 during Governor Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera’s time (1635-1644), causing the Kapampangan’s refusal to plant rice. The bandala was abolished in the provinces of Tondo, Bulacan, Pampanga, Laguna, Batangas, Tayabas and Cavite in November 1782"

By 1884, the tribute was replaced by the cedula personal or personal identity paper, equivalent to the present residence tax. INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 83 Everyone, whether Filipino or other nationalities, over eighteen years of age was required to pay the cedula personal. B. Polo y Servicio Personal or Prestacion Personal.\" -Polo actually is a corruption of the Tagalog pulong, or iginally meaning “meeting of persons and things” or “community labor.” Drafted laborers (polistas) were either Filipino or Chinese male mestizos ranging from 16 to 60 years old, who were obligated to give personal service to community projects, like construction and repair of in frastructure, church construction, or cutting logs in for ests, for forty days until 1884, when labor was reduced to k fifteen days. However, one could be exempted by paying the falla (corruption of the Spanish falta, “absence,” corrupted into the contemporary paly a, “absence from work,”) which the polista paid daily at IV 2 real during the 40-day period he was expected to work. The polo system was patterned after the Mexican repartimiento or selection for for ced labor. Some of the negative effects of the polo on the Filipino in cluded the upsetting of the village economy because labor drafts usually coincided with the planting and harvesting seasons; for ced separation from the family and relocation to different places, sometimes outside the Philippines; and decimation of the male population as they were compelled at times, to escape to the mountains in stead of working in the labor pool. According to De la Costa:... Large numbers of able-bodied men were frequently with drawn for long periods from their families and or dinary occupations, or ganized into labor corps under the supervision of overseers, and sent to fell logs in the for ests, haul them to the shipyards, and work in the construction of the ships the mselves. This labor draft fell most heavily on the Pampango and Tagalog provinces of central Luzon, because of the shipyards located at Cavite. C. Encomiendas: Royal and Private.~~The encomienda, from the word encomendar, meaning ‘ to entrust,” was another revenue-getting Hispanic in stitution in troduced to the Philippines via Mexico. Strictly speaking, it was a grant from the Spanish crown to a meritorious Spaniard to exercise control over a specific place in cluding its in habitants. It was not a land grant as most earlier scholars believed. The encomendero was duty-bound to defend his encomienda from external in cursions, to keep peace and or der, and to assist the missionaries in teaching the Christian 84 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE gospel to the residents within his sphere of in fluence. In return, the encomendero was granted the right of imposing tribute accord¬ ing to the limit and kind set by higher authorities. For in stance, Silang, in upland Cavite, was an encomienda of Captain Diego Jorge de Villalobos of Lisbon and his wife, Magdalena de Illescas. He settled personal feuds within his encomienda even as he assist¬ ed the restitution of fire victims and the erection of a new church and convent for his community. Villalobos contributed P 100 in cash and 180 fanegas of rice for parish assistance when he became encomendero. Two kinds of encomiendas existed in the Philippines: the royal or crown (realenga or encomienda de la real corona) and the private (encomienda de particulares). The for mer were lands reserved for the crown and in cluded the principal to wns and ports, like Bagum- bayan (now Luneta), Lagyo (approximately the site of the present Plaza militar, between Malate and Ermita), Santa Ana de Sapa, Tondo, Navotas and Malabon in Manila; and Lubao and Betis in Pampanga. The private encomiendas were granted to in dividuals who were either the King’s proteges or men who served with merit during the conquest and pacification campaigns. Examples of these were Pandacan, Sampaloc and Macabebe, privately owned by one Pedro de Chaves; Bataan by Juan Esguerra; and Batangas owned personally by Francisco Rodriguez. At least two distinguished Fili¬ pinos from Pampanga were owners of private encomiendas Francis¬ co Liwag with 55 tributes (1645-50) and Juan de Macapagal with 300 tributes (1665). When first implemented in the Visayas, Legazpi authorized the encomendero to collect tribute of eight reales yearly in cash or in kind from all 19 to 60-year old Filipino males of private encomiendas. At least one-fourth of the to tal collection went to the encomendero, another portion to the priests, and the remaining to the government. However, some encomenderos violated regulations by raising the rate of tribute paid in money or in kind by the poor Filipinos. With profit motive in mind, encomenderos arbitrarily in creased the value and appraisal of products at different periods. The unscrupulous among them made tremendous gains in temporarily hoarding staple items like rice and clothing materials and selling them at higher rates later. To evade penalties and corporal in flictions, Filipinos who could not afford either the monetary or species payment fled to the hills. Those who escaped from the oppressive taxation were regarded by Spaniards as “lawless” remontados or tulisanes (bandits). INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 85 A There was much confusion as a result of the lack of systematic tribute collection. Each encomendero collected according to his personal whim.

When gold was abundant and money was scarce, they demanded cash or reales; when the reales were plentiful and there was scarcity of gold, they asked for gold, even when the poor Filipinos were coerced to buy them. During bumper harvests, they demanded products like rice, to bacco or even all of the Filipino possessions, and they were for ced “to travel great di¬ stances’* to try to buy them at high rates. Sometimes, the Fili¬ pinos bought back at very exorbitant prices the same items (rice, especially during lean harvest) they sold for a very low price. Encomenderos sometimes seized “the entire quantity of his rice” from the Filipino “with out leaving him a grain to eat.” Many Filipinos died of starvation, especially during famines and drought due to the scarcity of rice and they were for ced to eat coconut and banana shoots. If the Filipinos resisted they were publicly flogged, to rtured or jailed. These unjust collections of tributes was one of the causes of in termittent uprisings in the Philippines. D. The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade (1565-1815). — Running the only regular fleet service in the huge stretch of the Pacific Ocean for two hundred fifty years was the Acapulco galleon (known as galleon de Manila or nao de China) with two vessels making the journey yearly — one outgoing, the other in coming ■— between Manila and Acapulco de Ju£rez, reaching as far as Callao in Peru. The trip lasted approximately two hun¬ dred days, the return voyage alone taking seventy days. Through the Manila galleons, the Amerasian worlds were linked by untold luxuries and wealth: spices and silk for the Americans and the Mexican and Peruvian dos mundos (pillar dollars or “pieces of eight”) for the Asians. The galleon trade benefitted only a very small coterie of privileged Spaniards — the Spanish governor, members of the consulado (merchants with consular duties and rights) usually in sulares, and Spanish residents in Manila. The few Spaniards who relied heavily on the trade became affluent, but when the trade declined in the eighteenth century, an economic depression resulted which arrested the normal population growth. Tempted by the lucrative trade Chinese immigrants converged at the Parian or Alcaiceria of Manila in Binondo as early as 1637. By 1687, a community of Christian Chinese and mestizos was 86 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE already for mally based in Binondo. Retail and small credit busi¬ ness came under the control of Chinese mestizos. The damaging effects, e. g., the neglect of native extractive in dustries like agriculture and arrest of population growth of the Manila-Acapulco trade, far outbalanced the advantages. The only active Filipino in volvement was in the construction of galleons — in the cutting of massive and heavy Philippine hard- woodsr, hauling and transporting them usually to the far-off shipyards of Cavite, Mindoro, Marinduque or Masbate. Toponyms in Mindoro remind us of the travails of Filipino for ced labor: Naujan, where the naos (galleons) were built; Calapan, where the overburdened Filipino carpenters cut the huge and heavy logs into prepared wooden planks; and of course, Puerto Galera, where the completed galleys were safely moored. Filipinos were for cibly or dered by the alcaldes may ores to plant cdeonuts and abaca under the guise of “support of the Indians.” Failure to comply with the needed supplies of coconut oil and abaca fibers were heavily fined. Coconuts furnished the oil, wine, and coir for rigging and caulking for the galleons and other sea vessels. Abaca was transformed into rigging materials in Cavite. Ropes were also made from sugar (kaong) and sago (cabo negro) palm fibers, and iron-headed ship pikes from hardwoods. Sails were fashioned out of the Iloko-woven cotton blankets exacted as tribute payment. In the ory, galleon construction was not meant to conflict with the planting and harvesting schedules but in practice this was not the case. Thus, the growth of Philippine agriculture was further retarded, so that as early as the 1600 s, many of the significant Filipino cottage in dustries such as weaving and ex¬ tractive in dustries were being ruined and disregarded along with agriculture, as money and gains were channelled to the galleon trade. Forced labor ignited the Sumodoy revolt (1649) when the Visayans were drafted to haul timber to Cavite, and the Pampanga Revolt (1660), when the overburdened and Overtaxed Kapampangans were in flamed by the for cible cutting and hauling of heavy logs. However, among the positive results of the galleon trade were the in tercultural exchanges between the Philippines and the Americans, symbolized by no less than the Mexican-made Virgin of Antipolo, chosen as the patroness of the sailors, who protected them from untold perils across the Pacific.

Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country (1780-ca. 1895).*“A mere frigate captain before he assumed governorship, Jose de Based y Vargas represented the true ex¬ ample of Spain’s despotismo ilustrado, who for nine years re¬ vamped the then existing antiquated economic system which stagnated progress in the Philippines. Following the royal or der “to form a society of learned and competent persons capable of producing useful ideas,” he for mally or ganized, in 1780, the Real Sociedad Econ Smica de Amigos del Pats composed of lead¬ ing men in business, in dustry and the professions, whom he himself prodded to exploit the Island’s natural bounties. -The Society antedated the Royal Philippine Company. Both economic agencies acted as effective media and in struments of Spanish colonization. Compelled to make the colony truly self-supporting in economy and entirely self-sufficient from the annual Mexican subsidy, Basco in troduced the Plan General Econo mico which in cluded the in come-generating monopolies of to bacco, areca nut, spirituous liquors and explosives, which, unfortunately, brought untold hardships on the Filipinos. Extolling the ben¬ eficial effects of exploiting the island’s natural resources through agriculture, commerce and in dustry, this “enlightened despot” gave in centives by awarding cash prizes and medals of recognition for excellence in farming in digo, spices, cotton, cultivating mul¬ berry for silk production, bee-keeping, mining, in ventions, the arts and sciences. Despite the society’s uncertain existence, it 88 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of fered local and for eign scholarships and training grants and an endowment fund for a professorial chair in agriculture, and established an academy of design. It was equally responsible for in troducing and acclimatizing the mynah birds (martinez) from China to fight against migratory locust in festation in the Philippines. The society was also credited with in troducing the carabao ban in 1782 (to conserve this draft animal), the for mation of silversmiths and gold beaters' guild in 1783, and the construction of the first papermill in the Philippines in 1825. The Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country died temporarily in 1787, was revived in 1819, and was suspended briefly in 1820 due to the Asiatic cholera epidemic. It resumed its activities in 1822, gradually faded out in 1875, revived again in 1882, until it ceased to exist by the middle of the 1890 s. F. Royal Philippine Company (1785-1814).—On March 10, 1785, Charles III created the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter for the main purpose of uniting American and Asian commerce. It was granted exclusive monopoly of bringing to Manila, not only Philippine but also Chinese and Indian goods, and shipping them directly to Spain via the Cape of Good Hope. Modelled after the Royal Guipuzcoana de Cara¬ cas Company in South America, it was vehemently opposed by Dutch and English in terests who saw it as a direct at tack on their trade in Asian goods. It also met stiff opposition from the Spanish-Manila traders of the Consulado y Comercio de Ma¬ nila who saw it as a strong competitor of the Manila-Acapulco trade. A royal decree assigning 3,000 shares of stocks (out of the 32,000) for the Manila merchants and religious corporations partially mollified the galleon traders even as some refused the subscription. This keen rivalry resulted in political unrest in the Philippines and tremendous losses suffered by the Manila board of mer¬ chants, in addition to losses suffered from disastrous shipwrecks and piracy. The Manila-Acapulco trade deteriorated as the Royal Philippine Company reaped profits. After a decade of existence, it netted a gain of more than ten million pesos in 1794-95 out of its in itial capital stock of eight million, and in the following year, more than fifteen million pesos. Forty percent of its net profits were set aside for research, technical assistance, and community development in the Philippines. For the Spaniards, the Company helped the early growth of agriculture, especially of Philippine- INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 89 grown products like in digo, sugar, coffee, spices, dye-wood (sibu- cao) and textiles. To the Filipinos, the effect was more untold misery, as they were for ced to plant much-prized cash exports crops from which they did not have any direct benefit at all. The Royal Philippine Company devoted exclusive preference to cotton production and weaving, cultivation of black pepper, besides the propagation of silk, in digo and sugar. Cotton cloth weaving was an ancient Filipino cottage in dustry and cotton was a favorite trade item that at tracted the Chinese in Legazpi’s time. Blankets and other textiles also served as gold and other in¬ digenous produce were used for tribute payment. G. Infrastructure, Telecommunications and Public Utilities Development.-Modem ways of telecommunications developed in the nineteenth century. The Ferrocarril de Manila extended 120 miles long up to Dagupan (Pangasinan) and it was the only railway line in the Archipelago, constructed using mainly Fili¬ pino labor and operated regularly four years before the out¬ break of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. The Compahia de los Tranvias de Filipinas was established in Manila in 1885 by Jacobo Zobel de Zangroniz and Adolfo Bayo. By 1892 there were five street car service lines connecting the primate city with the suburbs: four horse-drawn in Intra- muros, Malate, Sampaloc and Tondo, and one tranvia de vapor (steam-powered) between Malabon and Binondo since 1888"

By 1892 there were five street car service lines connecting the primate city with the suburbs: four horse-drawn in Intra- muros, Malate, Sampaloc and Tondo, and one tranvia de vapor (steam-powered) between Malabon and Binondo since 1888. An animal-pulled tramcar service ran between Talisay (Negros Oc¬ cidental) and Dos Hermanas from 1895-1896 owned privately by Esteban de la Rama. Also in Manila were horse-drawn vehicles for hire: de luxe carriages of various sizes and shapes known as the quiles, in vented by Lt. Col. German Quilez, politico-gover¬ nor of Cebu in the mid-188 us; the araha, driven by one horse, and the victoria, by two, and, of course, the ubiquitous calesa and carretela. To avoid traffic jams in Arroceros and Quiapo, the Puente Colgante (now Quezon Bridge), the first suspension bridge in the Far East, was built. Measuring 110 meters long and seven meters wide and designed by Gustave Eiffel of the famous to wer in Paris, it was two-laned for carriages, with the raised middle portion reserved for foot-travellers. Pedestrians were charged a toll fee each of one kusing (un cuarto or V 2 centavo), while each horse cost three ciiartos (about 2 centavos). Tolls for carriages depend ed on the number of wheels; the more wheels the higher the rates. 90 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Traffic became heavier through the years and the daily average number of vehicles that crossed Escolta, the city’s main street and business sector, was 5,000. In the Bridge of Spain, several meters away from the present Jones, linkipg Binondo, the business district, with the walled city, it was 6,000 daily, in the late 1880 s. Twenty-five years earlier, it was only 915 for Escolta, and 1,256 for the Bridge of Spain. Indeed, Calle Hormiga, (meaning “ant”), a small alley in Binondo, vividly describes the sluggish vehicular movement owing to heavy traffic volume in Manila’s busiest commercial section. In 1889, the first bicycle appeared on Ma¬ nila’s streets. Ships sailed from Manila to Hongkong weekly, while the Manila-Barcelona trip was monthly. However, ships coming from Japan and other Eurasian countries and the United States arrived irregularly. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (N. Y.&.) started regular shipping between Manila and Yokohama in 1891. Interisland shipping to the Visayas and Mindanao was mainly through steamers and steamboats. The telephone in Manila, though in a very limited scale, began functioning since 1890, servicing in itially 170 clients (with Telephone Nos. 3 and 4, for the Archbishop and Governor General, respectively) with its main of fice at Intramuros and a branch at Calle San Jacinto (now T. Pinpin) in Binondo. The Iloilo telephone service started in 1894. The first telegraph lines between Manila and Corregidor commenced in 1872, the service extending as far porth as Ilocandia, and Bikolandia later. A decade later, in 1882 the Manila-Hongkong overseas telegram was laid via Cape Bolinao in Pangasinan, thus, putting Manila in constant to uch with Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. In 1897, the first in terisland submarine cable linking Manila to Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu, was laid by the Eastern Extension Australia and China Telegraph Company. Public lighting system in Manila and suburbs using coconut oil was considered by the ayuntamiento was early as 1814. The streets of Santa Cruz, Binondo, Quiapo, San Miguel and Samp aloe, where the more opulent Europeans and Filipinos concentrated, were illumined by oil by the mid-nineteenth century, gradually changing to the use of kerosene in the 1880 s. During this time, the use of kingke a French gas lamp named after Antoine Quin- quet (1745-1803), was absolutely banned in nipa houses as a fire prevention. Until the turn of the nineteenth century, the streets ( INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 91 of Intramuros and the suburbs were still lighted by gas, and at times, by coconut oil. By 1893, the walled city and suburbs were already powered by electricity, with the founding of La Electricista de Manila. II. EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION. • A. “La Letra Con Sangre Entra” (“Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child”).—The earliest schools in the Philippines were in compliance with Charles V’s decree of July 17, 1550, which provided that in dios in all the Spanish dominions: were to b 4 jf| taught the conqueror’s language. As part of conversion, the\" Spanish missionaries in the Philippines used children in the belief that they “would learn our alphabet, language, Christian doctrine. and customs, policies and transmit them in the town&afterwards.” The Society of Jesus, as the teaching or der, specifically believed that their hope of a “brilliant” Christianity came from children. “The Christian doctrine was the milk they sucked” and “from their tender youth in the Jesuit residences, they were taught. and in structed 4 n all virtues.” In fact, associated with Ihe policy of at tracting the Filipino chiefly class to conversion was the founding of a secondary school for “the sons of native ruling families” in preparation not only for Christianizing but also as future gohernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay. Thus, the Colegio de Ninos was founded in 1596, an annex of the Jesuit Colegio de Manila established a year before. After five years, the Colegio de Ninos folded up, due to lack of funds. Here, the sons of chiefs were taught Christian doctrine, the rudiments of the three R’s, vocal and in strumental music, and handicrafts. 1.

Boy’s Colleges and Secondary Schools.—The earliest colleges exclusively for sons of Spaniards were established in the Philippines by the Society of Jesus: the Colegio Maximo de San Ignacio (1589) which later became a university (1621); the College of San Ildefonso (now the University of San Carlos), the sole secondary school outside of Manila, i. e., in Cebu (1599); and the residential College of San Jose, opened with only thirteen students in 1601. In the College of San Ignacio, there were two kinds of training: one was for the priesthood, and the other, for a general secondary education. The curriculum in cluded Latin, philosophy, canon and civil law, and rhetoric. The College of the Immaculate Conception (now the Ateneo de Manila Uni¬ versity) grew out of the Escuela Pia for poor boys in 1817 and was founded by the Jesuits upon their return from expulsion in 92 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 1859. It was subsequently converted in 1865, to the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. The Society of Jesus ably administered the Escuela Normal de Maestros de Manila (1865-1901), the first normal school to train male teachers for primary schools, estab¬ lished by the decree of 1863. As Order of Preachers, the Dominicans also of fered tertiary education for boys and girls. The present University of Santo Tomas, or iginally called the Colegio de Nuestra Sehora del San- tfsimo Rosario, in 1611, was converted into a Dominican Uni¬ versity in 1645. It was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth century when such courses as medicine and pharmacy (1871), notary public (1878), philosophy and letters (1896), were in¬ cluded in the curriculum of the University of Santo Tomas. Opened in 1620, the present College of San Juan de Letran was or iginally founded as the Seminario de Ninos Huerfanos de San Pedro y San Pablo “for or phaned Spanish children.” Since 1640 it was known by its present name and is now considered oldest secondary school in the Philippines. 2. Girl’s Schools.—The first boarding schools for Spanish girls in the Philippines were the Colegios (secondary schools) of Santa Potenciana (1591-1864) and Santa Isabel (1632), now considered the oldest school for girls in the archipelago. They were or iginally founded for the benefit of or phan Spanish girls. Besides these, exclusive colegios for the daughters of upper-class Spaniards were called beaterios, established for young girls called beatas who led a secluded life. These beaterios in cluded the Beaterio de la Compama de Jestis (now the Religious of the Virgin Mary) founded in 1684; Santa Catalina de Sena (1696); San Sebastian de Calumpang (now Sta. Rita College, (1719); Santa Rita de Pasig (1740); and Santa Rosa (1750). Two of these • beaterios were actually established to teach Spanish culture and values to young Filipinas and were founded by Filipino women: the Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM Sisters) and the Beaterio de San Sebastian de Calumpang of the 6 rden Terciarias de Recole- tos. The nineteenth century saw the establishment of other colegios for women: the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion Concordia, now Concordia College (1868); Looban (1885), and Assumption (1892), which supervised the Escuela Normal Superior de Maestras to prepare Filipino women teachers for the primary schools. A primary school set up in 1864 by the ayun- INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 93 tamiento of Manila — the Municipal Girls* School — was trans¬ for med into a normal school for women teachers in girls’ schools four years later, under the Sisters of Charity. A free compulsory publicly-supported system of primary schools came with the Educational Decree of 1863, simultaneous with the establishment of a men’s normal school to prepare future schoolmasters. Each town had at least two schools, one for boys and another for girls, aged from six to fourteen years old. Classes were held daily, except Sundays and holidays, for five and one- half hours in the morning and afternoon, starting at 7:00 to 10:00 a. m. and from 2:30 to 5:00 p. m. Classes were one hour longer in the morning during the summer months from April to June, and no classes were held in the afternoon. Subjects taught were in the three R’s, Christian doctrine, morality and sacred history (taught by the parish priest), general geography and Spanish history, agriculture, rules of courtesy, vocal music and Spanish language. Pupils were for bidden to speak their own dialects. Girls studied sewing in lieu of agriculture, geography and Spanish history. Parents who did not send their children to schools were fined one-half to 2 reales. It must be noted that education was free only for poor pupils whose parent’s in come was duly certified by the town gobernadorcillo and approved by the parish priest. However, wealthy parents paid a moderate sum monthly. Propagandists, like Rizal, bewailed the defects of the educa¬ tion al system implemented by the Spaniards in the Philippines. He believed that “the cause of our backwardness and ignorance is the lack of means of education, the vice that afflicts us from the beginning until the end of our careers.” Educational author¬ ities, he commented, could not even provide the simple books on morality, geography and the history of the Philippines “written in the language he speaks, since the immense majority of the people are engaged in working and cultivating the soil and raising cattle.” Lack of schoolbuildings was the most common problem in every town. Rizal observed that the schoolhouse may be “the vestibule of the parish house, or of any other house” which served as the temporary school, but which became permanent.

On the student’s lack of motivation to study, Rizal explained thus: Generally the spirit of emulation is not awakened in him be- 94 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE cause at the very beginning they humiliate him with beatings in the sight of his companions; he is not encouraged by any prize or reward because there is none; he finds no pleasure in what he is studying, itself sterile, but it becomes more sterile and in grateful from the moment he realizes its usefulness because neither does he understand it not find it anything to reward his sacrifices. * HI. Social Transformation.-Probably one of the in delible marks left by the Spanish conquest on the Filipinos was the adoption of Hispanic names, as decreed by Governor Narciso Claverfa in 1849. Based on compiled names of saints, in digenous and. Chinese patronymics, flora and fauna, geographical names, and the arts, Filipinos were obligated to adopt surnames like Rizal, Del Pilar or Luna, although some in digenous surnames like Mabini, Malantic, Dandan and Panganiban, were retained. How¬ ever, the Catalogo alfabetico de apellidos contained some dero¬ gatory names like “Utut,” “Ung-goy,” and even “Casillas.” Not only were Filipinos given family names as bases for census and statistics, but the surnames also guaranteed exact tax collection, regular performance of polos y servicios personates, and control of population movement, the reby avoiding unauthorized migra¬ tion, tax evasion, and other abuses in the eyes of the Spaniards. Although strictly imposed in Bikolandia, some parts of Ilocandia and Panay, the change of family names was almost completely * ignored in some areas of Laguna and Pampanga. The bahay-kubo for the clase pobre of Filipinos persisted, even as the more affluent ones went to the extent of refining, developing, expanding and metamorphosing this autochthonous dwelling into a bahay na bato with a wide azotea (from the or iginal batalan), and sometimes retaining the banguerahan and providing an aljibe or a well for the much-needed water supply. Foreign cuisine, both Spanish and Chinese in fluenced the Fili¬ pino table, smartly in digenized or mixed with the Filipino sinigang or pinangat. Filipino in genuity is still reflected in the Spanish- in troduced but already in digenized dishes as the adobo, menudo, sarciado, puckero, or mechado, and the Chinese-derived noodle preparations which have been Filipinized into pancit Malabon and pancit luglog. The precolonial mode of dressing changed gradually with the permanent settlement of the Spanish conquistadores. Thus, the kanggan and bahag (loin-cloth) were transformed into the barong tagalog or camisa chino and trousers, respectively. Hats INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 95 replaced the putong, and shoes and slippers became part of men’s fashion. The baro and soya for women continued to be worn except that it eventually developed into the mestizo, dress. Pre¬ colonial fondness for jewelry and body or naments was continued using the Spanish-style tambourine, the gold and to rtoise peineta, and earrings of different sizes and shapes. Indeed by 1663, Fr. Francisco Colin was already describing the apparent change in Filipino clothing, saying that Now they have begun to wear the Spanish clothes and orna¬ ments, namely, chains, necklaces, skirts, shoes, and mantillas, or black veils. The men wear hats, short jackets [ropillas], breeches,- and shoes. Consequently, the present dress of the Indians in these regions, is now almost Spanish. Nobody can deny the extent of the Spanish loan words that filtered into the major and minor languages of the Philippines like dasal from rezar, dalandan from naranja, and sinigwelas ^ from ciruela. Conversely, the Filipinos also contributed to enrich the Spanish language camarin from kamalig, carinderia from karihan, and molave from mulawin. With the conversion of the Filipinos, fiestas honoring the saints were in troduced. From January to December, there were fiestas from the town to the barrio level all over the lowland Christianized Philippines. The births or anniversaries of members of the Spanish royalty were also occasions for festive merry¬ making. Indeed, it was not only a socializing factor but also one of the most potent allurements for the yet unbaptized Fili¬ pinos. The scattered “in dios” of a barangay were enticed period¬ ically to the town proper by means of the fiestas during Holy Week, on Corpus Christi, and the feast day of the patron saint. “Not only did the fiestas provide a splendid opportunity to in doctrinate the Filipinos by the performance of religious rituals,” says Phelan, “but they also afforded the participants a welcome holiday from the drudgery of toil.” The Filipinos released their tension through the pomp and pageantry of the religious proces¬ sions, the exotic Hispanic dances and music, and the religious dramas of the sinakulo and the komedya or moro-moro. In addition, the cofradios and sodalities of Filipino laymen and lay women honoring the Virgin Mary awakened in them a Christian community consciousness which helped in stamping out pre¬ colonial practices and even discouraging ritual drinking.

The first funeral parlor in the Philippines, La Funeraria, was estab¬ lished by Carlos March in Manila (1883) which advertised Euro¬ pean-made coffins, embalming, “French-style packing,” tomb¬ stones, and guaranteed “permanent service.” IV. Cultural Transformation.—The precolonial bay bay in (syllabic writing) was supplanted by the Latin alphabet as part of the Hispanization of the Filipinos. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was observed that it was already rare to find a Fili¬ pino “who still knew how to read them, much less write them. All of them read and write our Castilian letters now,” wrote Fr. Sebastian Totanes in 1745. However, Fr. Pedro Andres de Castro noted, as late as 1776, that he still saw in the Augustinian archives of Lipa and Batangas many documents written iti the Tagalog syllabary “in or der to understand profound mysteries and concepts.” Before laying the ground for the successful Hispanization of the Philippines, the Spanish missionaries relent¬ lessly destroyed everything they considered belonging to the devil, and replacing them with their own the ocentric literature. According to James Robertson — The early missionaries in the Philippines as those in Mexico were prone to regard the ancient writings equally with the objects used in such worship as was practiced by the native people as works of the evil one, lienee they ruthlessly destroyed these signs of culture whenever and wherever found. The potent appendages of education were the printing press, books and libraries. When the Spanish friars in troduced the art of printing in the Philippines, their primary purpose was to facilitate their work of converting the Filipinos. The develop¬ ment from the xylographic (San Gabriel: 1593) to the more practical duplicator by movable typography (Binondoc: 1604, de visu copy), was in line with the desire to accelerate in doc¬ trination of as many Filipinos as possible via printed religious tracts. Religion constituted the bulk of Fiiipiniana put out during the Spanish regime. The three earliest books published at the Parian of Manila in 1593 by wood-block printing were: Doctrina Christiana, en lengua espahola, y tagala, Fr. Juan Co bo’s Wu-chi T'ien-chu cheng-chiao chen-ch'uan shih-lu (A Discussion INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 97 of the Real Traditional Propagation of the True Religion) and Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china. The earliest known de visu work by means of movable types was Ordinationes generates published by Juan de Vera in 1604. As far as records show, the earliest known Filipino writers during the seventeenth century were an unknown Tagalog laditio (bilingual) poet who wrote May bagyo ma't may rilim (“Though Stormy and Dark”) in 1605, Fernando Bagongbanta’s Salamat nang ualang hanga (“Eternal Thanks”) and Tomas Pinpin's auity both from Bataan, in 1610 and Pedro Suarez Ossorio of Ermita, Manila, who left Salamat nang ualang hoyang (“Endless Thanks”) in 1627. In the eighteenth century, Gaspar Aquino de Belen, Felipe de Jesus and Jose de la Cruz (“Huseng Sisiw”) ranked among the more famous ones. As early as the mid-sixteenth century, Spain had desired that schools for the teaching of Spanish among the in dios be established in their colonies. In May 1596, Governor Francisco Tello was in structed by the crown that in or der to make reduccion successful, the Filipinos should be taught Castilian and the friars “should learn the language of the Indians whom they are to teach and in struct.” For in stance, in 1792, Filipinos were strictly for bidden to speak their own dialects in convents, monasteries and courts, where only Spanish should be the medium of commu¬ nication. The Spanish friars were, however, uncooperative with regards to Spanish. They considered an uneducated Filipino who knew Spanish a future \"filibustero'” Having an idioma general or lingua franca meant national unity in a country like the Philip¬ pines, with a diversity of languages. Theocentric literature appeared as soon as the Spaniards settled permanently in the Philippines in the form of awit (do- decasyllabic quatrain); corrido (octosyllabic quatrain), and me¬ trical romances, written by early poets such as Ananias Zorilla, Jose de la Cruz, and Francisco Baltazar.

In fact, these readings constituted the bulk of the “very poor” Filipiniana collection of the first public library and museum opened, the Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinos in 1892. Understand¬ ably, there were no books on political science in the library collection which would have politicized the Filipinos before the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. Folk, as well as colonial art, persisted with the Spanish coloni¬ zation. Christianity produced the variegated forms of Filipino arts and crafts surrounding the religious fiestas. The visual arts, like the making of imagenes, santoses, and jewelry, bloomed during this time. Folk art observed during fiestas are seen up to this day in the whittled bamboo arch decorations (kaluskos), moriones, rosaries, combs, the palaspds, the Christmas parols, pastillas wrappers, and colorful art presentation in foods served, as pan de San Nicolas, at sara (pickles) or sapin-sapm. Painting was already secularized, according to the Synod of Calasiao in 1773, even as the painters were allowed freely to practice their art outside the church a decade later. This was exemplified by the Chinese mestizo painter Faustino Quio- tang, who flourished in the 1820 s, producing Sedes Sapientiae and San Jose with Child Jesus. Damian Domingo, an in sular, director of the Academia de Dibujo from 1827 to 1833, however, is considered the first known painter followed by miniaturismo artists Juan Arceo and Juan Transfiguracion Nepomuceno and their families. Two other contemporaries of Domingo were Seve- rino Flavier Pablo and Hilarion Soriano. Arceo of Paco, flourish¬ ing in the 1830 s, did religious paintings, and his son, Ysidro (“Y. A.”), produced his best works in the 1870 s. In the 1840 s Nepomuceno and his son were credited with a series of litho¬ graphic local landscapes and costumes for a French-commissioned work. One of the painters of note was Antonio Malantic, famous for his detailed paintings of famous portraits dressed in the di- iphanous piha fiber blouse of the mid-1850 s. Mariano Asuncion and his six sons, among them Justiniano (“Capit&n Ting”) and Leoncio, and nephews remain the best-known family of reputed INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 99 artists between the middle to the turn of the nineteenth century. Standing out as unique among landscape painters of the period was Jose Honorato Lozano (“Pepe Vigia” or “Bahia”) of Sam- paloc and his letras y figuras. The Academia de Dibujo y Pintura (later Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado in 1893- 1898) trained artists which in cluded Lorenzo Guerrero, a non¬ religious painter. Simon Flores was noted for his paintings of reli¬ gious to pics, while Regino Garcia y Baza did some plates as chief illustrator of Fr. Manuel Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas (1877-80). Towering among the academic painters, however, were Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo. During this period, genre art also “came into voque,” with Maria Paz Paterno standing out as the only woman painter of the nineteenth century famous for her still life (bodegones) paintings. / The nineteenth century also had a share of some noted pro¬ vincial artists, notably in Ilocandia, where Esteban Villanueva of Vigan (Ilocos Sur) did the fourteen tableaux of the Ambaristo or basi revolt of 1807. Provincial artists cropped up, producing not only religious, but also lovely portraits of men of leisure and their family members. Laguna produced Jose Dans who executed Final Judgment and Heaven, Earth, Hell; Tayabas (now Quezon) had Vicente Villasenor of Lucban; and Cavite had Roman Faustino whose Ensueho won a medal in the provincial exposition of 1892. Filipinos also figured prominently in printmaking, engraving and typography, among whom were Nicolas de la Cruz Bagay, who was considered the first Filipino engraver, Cipriano Romual- do Bagay, Francisco Suarez, Laureano Atlas, Felipe Sevilla and Candido Lopez. Juan de los Santos from San Pablo de los Montes (San Pablo City, Laguna), sculpted the baroque altar of the San Agustin Church in the walled city during the early part of the eighteenth century. Paete woodcarvers stood out as among the most famous during the nineteenth century, among whom were Mariano Madrinan and Aurelio Buhay. With the found¬ ing of the Academia de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado de Manila (from the or iginal Academia de Dibujo y Pintura in 1855), well- known Manila sculptors of icons in wood and ivory were led by Isabelo Tampingco, Sotero Garcia and Romualdo T. de Jesus. There were also non-religious sculptors, like Ciriaco Gaudinez, Felix Pardo de Tavera and Ciriaco Arevalo. The early missionaries facilitated Filipino conversion by using Hispanic music along with the in troduction of Western 100 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE in struments such as the or gan, harp, guitar, and piano. The Franciscan friars were the most zealous in utilizing music in Christianization, using children in teaching both Gregorian and figurado chants. A school of music in Lumbang (Laguna) in 1606 taught not only the latest in music but also dances as the fandango, seguidilla and the jota. By the nineteenth century, some Filipinos were already composing both religious and secular music; among them Marcelo Adonay, Simplicio Solis, Julian Felipe, Julio Nakpil and Dolores Patemo who composed “F/or de Manila ” (“Sampaguita V.

[and] they adapted many Hispanic features to their own in digenous culture.” They were “partially Hispanized” and “never lost that Malaysian stratum which to this day remains the foundation of their culture.” “The Filipi nos who in early times were governed by our true countrymen before the coming of the Spaniards,” wrote Andres Bonifacio, “were living in great abundance and prosperity... [and] young and old, in cluding women, knew how to read and write in our autochthonous alphabet.” However, as a consequence of Hispanization at tendant with the so-called “new era for the Filipinos,” Rizal succintly observed that they... little by little... lost their old traditions, the mementos of their past;... gave up their writing, their songs, their poems, their laws in or der to learn by rote other doctrines which they did not understand, another morality, another aesthetics different from those in spired by their climate and their manner of thinking. Then they declined, degrading the mselves in their own eyes; they be¬ came ashamed of what was their own; they began to admire and praise whatever was for eign and in comprehensible; their spirit was dismayed and it surrendered. It may be observed that Phelan and Rizal’s keen observations apply only to the Christianized Filipinos, for “the cultural patterns of the Muslims and other minorities,” according to Samuel K. INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF SPANISH RULE 101 Tan, “had remained generally unchanged, however persistent were the Spanish efforts to convert them, simply because they resisted or avoided conversion.” By the end of the Spanish rule, the transformation of the Philippine colony had created a blending of the native and Spanish cultures which became the bases of Filipinism or nationalism. Thus, when the Filipinos passed to another colonial era it was the synthesis of for eign and native which more or less guided their behavior and response to the next century. 7 FROM INDIO TO “FILIPINO” The Filipinos began to fight the Spaniards the moment they settled permanently in 1565 and continued this resistance to the end of their rule in 1898. All these pockets of resistance for various causes burst into a national^ struggle as the Filipinos fought to liberate the mselves from Spanish domination in the Philippine Revolution of 1896-97. In October 1889, a group of ilustrados in Paris, signing the mselves as “The Filipinos,” ad¬ dressed the following “To Our Dear Mother Country, Spain”: When a people is gagged; when its dignity, honor, and all its liberties are trampled; when it no longer has any legal recourse against the tyranny of its oppressors, when its complaints, petitions, and groans are not at tended to; when it is not permitted even to weep; when even the last hope is wrested from its heart; then...! then...! then...! it has left no other remedy but to take down with delirious hand from the altars the bloody and suicidal dagger of revolution! i Lapulapu of Mactan (1521) and Dagami of Cebu (1567) were among the first Filipinos to refuse to bow under Spanish yoke. The revolt patterns must be treated holistically, and not separately, as personal and religious functions may be one and the same in one leader. In other words, a personally-motivated revolt may also have been motivated by religious, or even, econom¬ ic, causes. However, in this chapter, revolts are categorized, for convenience, into (1) personal, led by for mer political (datus, maginoos and maharlikas) and religious (babaylans or katalonans) leaders; (2) resistance to oppressive Spanish-in troduced economic as well as religious in stitutions, and (3) land problems. A. Personal Motives.—As proved by of ficial records, some revolts were personally led by for mer barangay datus and mahar¬ likas, as well as babaylans or katalonans, who had lost their prestige and power in their communities with the coming of the Spaniards, and were supplanted by leaders chosen by the Spaniards 102 FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 103 and by the Spanish friars. Not only did they yearn to revert to their own culture then gradually being Hispanized by Christian¬ ization, but most of all, to regain the freedom they for merly enjoyed as a people. The ex-datus who regularly received the handog (annual tribute or gift) from their barangay members, now lost their in fluence although some of them who joined in the pacification campaign of the conquistadores, were granted exclusive royal privileges of exemption from tribute and for ced labor, along with the retention of their patronymics, like Rajah Tupas of Cebu, Lakandula of Manila, and Pedro Mojica of Cavite. The babaylans, like Tamblot and Tapar, apostasized and desired to go back to their precolonial animism. In fact, some of the native priestesses and priests in various parts of the Philippines continued the pag-anito surreptitiously behind the backs of the ever-vigilant friars, who declared them not only idolatrous, but also unlawful. These religious leaders were soon superseded by the different waves of Spanish regular clergy. It may also be observed that personal vendetta sometimes triggered kin- related uprisings. Lakandula and Soliman, last of the Manila chieftains, revolted in 1574, the same year Limahong at tacked the poorly-protected palisaded Intramuros. Before Legazpi’s demise, Lakandula was baptized as “ Carlos Lacandola,” and he and his descendants (with Rajah Soliman), were justly compensated with exemption from tribute and for ced labor, which their families enjoyed until 1884. Another fringe benefit the Lakandula and Soliman families got was the exclusive right to keep their family names"

However, with Legazpi’s death in 1572, his successor, Lavezares, sequestered their landed properties and even to lerated the encomendero's abuse and oppression of their people. Hence the revolt in 1574. The ‘'conspiracy of the maharlikas” (not the common tao) of 1587-88 were led by the kin-related datus of Manila and some to wns of Bulacan and Pampanga, under Agustin de Legazpi, son of Lakandula and his first cousin, Martin Pangan. The master¬ minds, when finally caught, were in itially dragged on hurdles to the gallows, hanged, decapitated, and exposed (on the gibbet) in iron cages, as a grim warning against the crime. Their severed heads were stuck on pikes placed in wicker baskets for public exhibition. The sites of their houses were plowed and sown with salt, and all their properties were sequestered. The minor datus were banished to Mexico, counting among them Pitong Gatang, Felipe Salonga, and Dionisio Kapulong. They swore / 104, HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE loyalty to rise up in arms by anointing their necks with a split egg. The uprising failed when Antonio Susabau of Calamianes and Amarlahagi, datu of Bay, Laguna divulged the plot to the Spanish authorities. Paganism and idolatry persisted even after the first and second generation Spanish friars, had converted zealously the Filipinos en masse, as exemplified by thirty babaylans in Bohol who in 1611 smashed their ancestral idols and altars and even joined the children’s class in catechism. However, not all the highly- respected shamans surrendered to the loss, not only of their tangible means of in come, but also their time-honored personal prestige, in the barangay. Indeed, they with drew to the back- woods before the arrival of the missionaries who successfully utilized various enticing conversion methodology. They found out that living in the Christianized reduccidn, “under the peal of the bells,” was irritating. In 1621-22, an outlawed babaylan, Tamblot of Bohol, em¬ ployed magic and religion in alluring the unbelieving people to abandon Christianity and to return to their for mer beliefs. Tamblot guaranteed the apostates that their ancestors and diwatas (anitos) would support them. Using magic, Tamblot cut a bamboo with a small knife and wine allegedly gushed forth, even as he slashed another bamboo, and rice emerged. In addi¬ tion, he promised his awed adherents that the “mountains would rise against their foe; that the muskets of the latter would not go off or rebound on those who fired them; that if any Indian would die, the [diwatas] would resuscitate him.” In no time, he was crushed by Juan de Alcarazo, alcalde mayor of Cebu, using a number of men coming from this nearby island. The sparks of this rebellion spread to Carigara (Leyte), led by Bankaw, datu of Limasawa, who warmly received Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565 and supplied the Spaniards with their immediate needs. Although baptized as a Christian in his youth, he apostasized in his old age. With the babaylan Pagali, he built an appropriate temple to the diwata and pressed six to wns to rise up in arms. Like the Tamblot revolt, the shaman used magic to at tract devotees, saying that they could petrify the Spaniards and that woman or child could easily change the enemies into clay by simply hurling bits of earth on them. Alcarazo checked the revolt in no time, and Bankaw’s severed head was impaled on a bamboo stake and publicly displayed as a stem warning. His 105 I ROM \"INDIO** TO ill I PI NO'* second son was equally decapitated, and a daughter was later captured. To in spire further terror on the rebels, three or four adherents were shot and one of the babaylans was burned. The eighteenth century saw some significant revolts in our history: Dagohoy in Bohol, Silang in the Ilocos, Palaris in Pangasi- nan, and Magtangaga in Cagayan. The longest revolt in Philippine history was that of Francisco Dagohoy, a cabeza de barangay of Bohol, taking 85 years (1744-1829) to quell. Although for ced labor was one of the causes of Dagohoy’s revolt, it was the Jesuit Fr. Gaspar Morales’ refusal to give his brother, Sagarino, a Christian burial, on the ground that he died in a duel and had not received the extreme unction, that triggered it. Sagarino was a constable of Talibon who was slain while carrying out the or der of the same priest. Upon or der of Fr. Morales, Sagarino’s rotting corpse was exposed for three days in front of the Inabangan church. With the leading members of the Tagbilaran, Baclayon, and Dauis principalia and some 3,000 men, Dagohoy proclaimed “free Bohol” in Inabangan and Talibon mountains and refused the unjust payment of tribute and rendering of for ced labor. How¬ ever, Dagohoy did not live to see the end of the uprising which he successfully in itiated. As in other revolts elsewhere, this was a consequence of the realization of the Filipinos that the Spanish might was weak, as proved by their humiliating defeat with the fall of Manila in September 17 G 2 to the British in vaders from the Coromandel coast of India. Pockets of resistance also erupted simultaneous¬ ly in the northern province of Cagayan, and in the hacienda to wns of Laguna, Batangas and Cavite. B. Religious Motives.-The continuous Hispanization of the Filipinos through religion was in line with Spain’s policy of “Gospel, Gold and Glory.” Various at tempts were made to proselytize the various cultural communities by employing a newly Christianized chieftain or his children and family as shining models for the other barangay members to follow, or by using a Christianized member of a converted ethnic community to evangelize other neighboring unconverted groups. Some of the uncompromising or apostates among them, however, reverted to their old beliefs in stead of embracing the new religion"

Some of the uncompromising or apostates among them, however, reverted to their old beliefs in stead of embracing the new religion. Among them were Miguel Lanab and Alababan (1625-27), Tapar (1663), Francisco Rivera (1718), Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz (1840-41), and, of course, the Muslims in the Southern Philippines, and the Igorots in the Cordilleras. 106 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Two new Christianized Isnegs (“Mandayas”) of northwest Cagayan, Miguel Lanab and Alababan of Capinatan (Apayao), re¬ volted in June 1625, by mutilating and beheading the Dom¬ in icans Fr. Alonzo Garcia and Brother Onofre Palao. Fr. Garcia was eventually cut to pieces and his flesh thrown to the pigs. Lanab and Alababan compelled the Isnegs to escape with them to the mountains, set fire to the churches, desecrate the images and loot properties. As a consequence, the newly-converted Isnegs voluntarily for ced their people to turn “their backs on the [Christian] faith, fleeing to the mountains” of Apayao. In 1626, a Spanish punitive force was dispatched to check the Isneg up¬ rising. A great number of palms were destroyed by the vindictive Spaniards to starve the Isnegs and for ced them to surrender. A nativist revolt with religious overtones was led by Tapar, a newly-Christianized babaylan in Oton, Iloilo, who proclaimed himself “God Almighty” and who “went about in the garb of a woman.” As a founder of a new syncretic religion, Tapar ap¬ propriated Catholic terminologies and did not find any need for Spanish curates as he believed that they had their own “popes” and “bishops and priests” with aides, “Jesus Christ,” “Holy Ghost,” and “Trinity” who could minister to them in their own way. In 1663, they slew Fr. Francisco de Mesa, burned the house and church, and fled to the mountains. By employing hired spies, the Spaniards captured the principal leaders, who, in the process of defending the mselves, were killed. However, their corpses were carried back to the port of Iloilo with the alleged killers. Soon, they were fastened to bamboo poles in the Jalaur River as estuarine crocodile feeds, even as the woman who was named as their “Blessed Virgin Mary” (Maria Santfsima) was mercilessly stuck on a bamboo and placed strategically at the mouth of the Laglag (now Duenas) River to be eaten up by the crocodiles. The Spaniards used Cebuano mercenaries and the merdekas from Siau to repulse the Ilongos. By 1664, peace had returned to Panay. Almost coeval with the Magtangaga revolt in Cagayan in Octo¬ ber 1718, was another religious uprising in Tuguegarao led by Francisco Rivera, a visionary who appropriated for himself the title of “Papa Rey ” (Pope and King). Together with his believers, he “deprived all the citizens and dependents of the Church” the freedom of worship by in structing his adherents in Tuguegarao to give back to the Dominican missionaries the rosaries, scapu- laries, and other religious objects. Rivera, thus, was described by a Spanish chronicler as “the only rebel chief with anti-religious FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 107 ideas”. He at tacked the Spaniards led by the alcalde mayor who were holed up in Lal-lo, the capital, for tified only by eighteen Spaniards, and killed more than fifty men in the assault. Only a few of Rivera’s men responded as his Tuguegarao believers got tired of his “irreligious and despotic” rule, and, in fact, desired to liquidate him. During this time, many people from Tugue¬ garao, Cabagan, and the other nearby to wns fled to the mountains and for ests. The uprising was finally stopped by Juan Pablo Orduna who came from Vigan. Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz’s revolt may be divided into two phases: phase I from 1832-1841 was from the founding of the Cofradia de San Jose in 1832 to the death of De la Cruz in 1841; and phase II from 1870-71, with the revival of the Co¬ fradia in 1870, terminating with the revolt and capture of Januario Labios in 1871. In December 1832, Ermano Pule, then barely eighteen years, with the Filipino secular priest, Br. Ciriaco de los Santos, and nineteen others from Tayabas (now Quezon) province, founded the cofradia centering around the cults of San Francisco and the famous brown image Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage of Antipolo. Five years later, the confraternity was named Cofra¬ dia del Sr. San Jose i voto del Santfsimo Rosario and proselytized in Tayabas and Laguna, particularly in Lucban (the founder’s hometown), Sariaya, and Majayjay. In 1837, the brotherhood appointed Apolinario de la Cruz as principal founder and pro¬ moter, with Octavio Ygnacio de San Jorge (“Purgatorio”) of Majayjay, Laguna as hermano mayor. The cofradia met monthly on the 19 th day (honoring St. Joseph’s day), paying a monthly fee of one real (12 l A centavos) and rice. As an in centive, a new member of both sexes who could bring in 12 new ones was named cabecilla, who received one vote in the confraternity’s general assembly; if he in itiated 12 more new recruits, he was entitled to two votes. He was promoted to the highest possible rank of hermano mayor when he recruited 48 members, which entitled him to a maximum of four votes. The cofradta's existence was unknown to the Spanish authorities until 1840, although as early as 1833, certain Filipino priests have already noticed the group’s movement in the areas of Mounts San Cristobal and Banahaw. Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz was an ex-donee (lay associate) in the San Juan de Dios Hospital, even as he was admitted to the Cofradia de San Juan de Dios which was open only to native- born but not to whites or mestizos.

As an in centive, a new member of both sexes who could bring in 12 new ones was named cabecilla, who received one vote in the confraternity’s general assembly; if he in itiated 12 more new recruits, he was entitled to two votes. He was promoted to the highest possible rank of hermano mayor when he recruited 48 members, which entitled him to a maximum of four votes. The cofradta's existence was unknown to the Spanish authorities until 1840, although as early as 1833, certain Filipino priests have already noticed the group’s movement in the areas of Mounts San Cristobal and Banahaw. Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz was an ex-donee (lay associate) in the San Juan de Dios Hospital, even as he was admitted to the Cofradia de San Juan de Dios which was open only to native- born but not to whites or mestizos. He was not admitted to a religious or der because he was an in dio. 108 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Restiveness among the cofradw's members started when it was outlawed by Governor Marcelino de Oraa in 1841 and mem¬ bers were arrested, in cluding its secretary, Octavio Ygnacio de San Jorge. Ermano Pule himself was captured and shot to death in November of the same year. His body was quartered; his severed head was hung in front of their house in Lual St. in Lucban; his two hands and two feet, were hung in side cages, and placed in the guardhouses of Tayabas. After twenty-nine years, the Cofradia de San Jos&'s reappear¬ ance was divulged on Corpus Christi day in 1870, by Br. Florentino Tuason, Filipino coadjutor priest to the alcalde mayor of Tayabas. Br. Tuason said that during the Lenten season some members reunited and celebrated their rituals on Mt. Banahaw, where they had erected their church and convent. Members came mostly from Nanca, Lumbang, Potol and Maluat, and monthly dues were collected from them by their cabecillas during nightly prayer meetings. They proselytized by ment ioning the alleged joint apparition of the Virgin of Rosary, Apolinario de la Cruz, the or iginal founder, and his assistant, Octavio Ygnacio de San Jorge, who or dered the revival of the confraternity, prescribing new religious rites and promising eternal bliss as a reward in the life after, abolition of the tribute, and freedom. Members were not allowed to hear mass in a Catholic church but only in their own sanctuary at Mt. Banahaw. Members were also enjoined not to be wedded by Catholic priests, but by their own elected priest, Januario Labios, who was called “Prof eta y Pontifice” (Prophet and Pope). The three families of Labios, Enriquez, and Cordero, in itiated the rebirth of the Cofradia de San Josi and led the prayers and the excursions to Mt. Banahaw. The same families had actively participated in Ermano Pule’s revolt in 1841. The cofradfa died out with the capture of Labios and his adherents in 1871, most of whom were banished to Calamianes Island in Palawan and Mindoro. C. Resistance to Spanish-Imposed Institutions.—The Spanish in stitutions of taxation, for ced labor, galleon trade, in dulto de comercio, and monopolies (on to bacco and spirituous liquors among others) were persistent irritants that cause Filipino to revolt. Among the major rebellions belonging to this class were those in the late 16 th century led by Magalat; the Sumodoy (Sumoroy) and the Caraga revolts in the 17 th century; the revolts FROM ‘‘INDIO” TO ‘‘FILIPINO” 109 of Magtangaga, Palaris and Silang and the Samal mutiny in the 18 th century; and the Ambaristo revolt in the first decade of the 19 th century. Led by Magalat, chief in Tuguegarao (Cagayan), with his brother, the opposition to the illicit tribute collection motivated the Cagayanos to revolt. Magalat’s revolt was finally subdued when some paid hirelings of the Spaniards from his own camp dastardly assassinated him In eastern Mindanao, covering the present east Davao, Surigao, and Agusan, another rebellion broke out in Caraga, from 1629-31, also in flamed by the unjust collec¬ tion of tribute in kind. Boatloads of rice were commandeered in the encomiendas for a 30-year period, with the town parish priest acting as of ficial tribute collector. In 1649-50, in Palapag, Samar, a son of a babaylany Juan Ponce Sumodoy, and a datu from Catubig, Pedro Caamug, headed an uprising that spread to other coastal to wns of Samar as far as the Bikol regions, Leyte, central Visayas, and northern Mindanao. This was a reaction to Governor Diego Fajardo’s or der of shifting recruitment of the irksome polos y servicios personates from Luzon to the Visayas for the first time, to relieve the Tagalogs in building galleons and warships in Cavite. The Visayans vehemently reacted to this kind of for ced labor in Luzon which separated them from their beloved families and their farms. However, the revolt was ex¬ peditiously contained by using the Christian Lutaws (Ramal) under Francisco Ugbo and Alonso Macombon, who arrived in Pa¬ lapag in May 1650. By early July, they reached Sumodoy’s almost in accessible camp atop a mesa (tableland), captured his mother, dragged her and threw her over a precipice. Sumodoy *s head was presented to the alcalde mayor by two of his for mer followers. In the eighteenth century, major uprisings occurred mostly in northern and central Luzon, spilling over to wards the Tagalog regions. In Cagayan, the poverty-stricken life of the farmers was made more despairing due to a series of lean rice and com yields caused by migratory locusts which wreaked havoc on the province during the first decade of the eighteenth century. Add¬ ing to their seemingly endless sufferings was the on erous exploita¬ tion of the alcalde mayor with his arbitrary exaction of tribute m the much-coveted staple grains, and the irritating recruitment of for ced laborers. Infuriated by the worsening economic situa¬ tion, “General” Luis Magtangaga, chief of Malaueg (now Rizal, Cagayan), assisted by an affluent chief of Tuao, Tomas Sinagui- 110 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ngan, led the Itawis and Gaddangs (“Irayas”) in the middle Caga¬ yan area to rise up in arms against the authorities in 1718, mo¬ bilizing a force of some 3,000 men to oust the hated alcalde mayor.

In 1719, Pangasinan also witnessed a revolt led by Juan Cara- gay, “of very low birth” from Dagupan, galvanized by the tyrannical acts of the alcalde mayor who used force in the unlawful collec¬ tion of tribute and draft labor"

In 1719, Pangasinan also witnessed a revolt led by Juan Cara- gay, “of very low birth” from Dagupan, galvanized by the tyrannical acts of the alcalde mayor who used force in the unlawful collec¬ tion of tribute and draft labor. While successful in murdering the abominable provincial governor, Caragay was slain later by loyal reinforcements from Dagupan and Binmaley headed by Juan Ramos, marshal-of-camp of Mangaldan, dominated by “Igorots” who chopped off Caragay’s head with just one stroke. Caragay was a mere “bandit” in the eyes of Hie Spaniards who claimed that he molested the people of San Jacinto and Mangal¬ dan. In the late 1750 s, Pangasinan experienced untold socio¬ economic restiveness as a consequence of destructive floods and poor harvest, which was further aggravated by the personal excesses of the then alcalde mayor, Joaquin de Gamboa. The regular tribute of one real fuerte (25 centavos) was or dered in creased lxh reales more, in spite of the previous natural disasters for cing the already afflicted farmers to pay more than the normal tribute to cover the expenses for the yearly elections and the payments of the acolytes and choir singers. Gamboa, likewise, exacted dried fish from the in terior to wns during the wet season, or dered a quota of fourteen polistas from every barangay, and to cap it all, controlled the community chest from the town of ficials. At Binalatongan (now San Carlos City), a principalia member, Juan de la Cruz Palaris, spearheaded a rebellion in 1762 against Gamboa’s personal excesses, which easily spread to the other major to wns of the province, reaching as far as the present Tarlac. In the end, Palaris was betrayed by his own sister to the town gobernadorcillo and brought to Lingayen where he was eventually hanged. Receiving the gravest penalty, he was quartered pig-style, with his mutilated head, hands, feet and gouged heart publicly exhibited at the six bridges of Binala¬ to ngan to strike terror among the people. Diego Silang, like Palaris, was a principalia, who vehemently opposed the exaction of the comim (annual tribute of one real fuerte), drafting of polistas, and other unscrupulous practices FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 111 of the new alcalde mayor, Antonio Zabala, a career military man who abused the in dulto de comer ciof Silang headed the revolt in December 1762, accompanied by the different cabos represent¬ ing the two Ilocos, Abra and Cagayan. Engendered by the mani¬ festo of the English India Company Provisional Government of May 1763 which guaranteed... to treat the Natives with the utmost humanity, leaving them in quiet Possession of their Pro¬ perties, and in the free Exercise of their Religion, to free them from all Taxes and oppressions,” Silang for mally joined for ces with the British. As a recompense, Governor Dawsonne Drake conferred on him the pompous titles of “Don Diego Silang,” Maestro de Campo General y Teniente de Justicia Mayor, to gether with the of ficial sanction of recognizing him the rightful head of the Ilocos government. The British Manila Council assured him of man and firepower. Bishop Bernardo Ustariz, meanwhile, proclaimed himself as the provincial head and issued an in terdict in the latter part of May 1763, and he excommunicated Silang. Fearing Silang’s threat to Spanish lives and properties, the bishop engineered his liquidation in Bantay (Ilocos Sur), even blessing the Spanish mestizo assassin, Miguel Vicos, an ex-silanista, who had taken confession and communion before executing the cowardly scheme. With Vicos was his friend and ex-confidant of Silang, Pedro Buecbuec (Becbec) of Abra. The killer nervously fired a musket through Silang’s back in the afternoon of May 1763, Silang dying in his wife’s arms. As if this was not enough, several principales of Santa (Ilocos Sur), in the belief that he was still alive sadistically stabbed the already dead body of Silang. Buecbuec was aptly rewarded by the grateful Spaniards with an appointment as justicia mayor of Abra, while Vicos sought refuge in Cagayan for fear of vendetta from Silang’s kin. With the death of Silang, alcalde mayor Manuel Arza y Urrutia of Cagayan in itiated the hot pursuit of the remaining rebels led by his widow, Maria Josefa Gabriela de Silang, and his uncle; Nicolas Carino. Eventually, Mrs. Silang, “the first woman to lead a revolt in the Philip¬ pines,” Sebastian Andaya and Miguel Flores, with about ninety loyal silanistas were hanged along the Ilocos Sur coastline, from Candon to Bantay, with Gabriela Silang compelled to watch the slow death of each of her faithful soldiers. She was herself executed last, in Vigan, on September 20,1763. Two essential monopolized items, to bacco and basi, especially important among the poorer classes of Filipinos, sparked the Lagutao (Labutao) revolt (1785), the Samal Mutiny (1787), and the Ambaristo or basi revolt (1807). 112 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE As an overt reaction to the implementation of the estanco (to bacco monopoly), resistance broke out in upper Cagayan, as in some lowland areas of the Philippines.

In Samal, Bataan, two years later, a mutiny broke out led by Lt. Andres Magtanong and Sub-Lt. Francisco Malibiran, members of the town militia, as reaction to the in troduction of the estanco in 1787. They killed the teniente uisitador and the to bacco monopoly guards. Quickly subdued, the rebels’ houses were torn down, and the sites plowed and strewn with salt so that no living things would ever grow where once stood the “traitors’” properties, reminiscent of the “conspiracy of the maharlikas” two hundred years before. Their families’ properties were con¬ fiscated, the mutineers the mselves were hanged, their bodies quartered, and their heads put on stakes for public display. In the north, some Ilocano military defectors who escaped from Vigan to Piddig (Ilocos Norte) staged an armed revolt in July 1807, against the oppressive monopoly of spirituous liquors in¬ troduced in 1786, which in cluded the control of making basi (fermented sugarcane juice). Also known as the “Ambaristo” revolt after the bravest right-hand man of the leader, Pedro Mateo of Piddig, the revolt failed, with the rebels summarily hanged and their bodies mutilated. Spirituous liquors, like nipa palm wine and basi, and other government-controlled items such as betel nut, and games like cockfights and playing cards, were enjoyed by most Filipinos, especially the clase pobre as social amenities to relieve them from the burdens of daily life. FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 113 D. Peasant Unrest.—In April 1745, the Tagalog regions were marked by peasant unrest which started in the hacienda town of Silang in Cavite, spreading blood to the rice-growing provinces nearby. The maginoos of Silang disputed fraudulent land surveys which usurped a large portion of the communal lands in Latag (now Carmona) and Lantic which were unjustly awarded to the Chinese and mestizo tenants of the Dominican-owned friar estate of Binan (Laguna). It is not surprising that it was a common saying in Cavite that “land grows each year” in the province. Led by the principals of Silang under Joseph de la Vega, Fran¬ cisco Santos de Medina, Ignacio Marcelo, Julio Lopez de Montoya, Andres Pulido, and Francisco Gonzales, they assaulted the con¬ troversial hacienda in April 1745 and razed the granaries and houses to the ground in Latag and Lantic. Even as the at tack was going on, the hacienda to wns of Cavite and Tondo rose up in arms, the unrest spreading as far as Meycauayan, in Bulacan, by June. By October 1745, the agrarian revolt spread to Batangas. However, the Tagalog rebellion failed and the leaders either put to death or banished. Some were sent to hard labor in galleys. By 1822, another peasant revolt broke out once again in the vast hacienda to wns of Cavite headed by Luis de los Santos (“Parang”) and Juan Silvestre (“Juan Upay”). Forty-eight ag¬ grieved farmers, tagged as a “reunion of bandits” by biased co¬ lonial writers, joined up and the unrest spread to the rice-and- sugar producing, friar-estate provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Laguna, Tondo, Bulacan, Bataan, and Pampanga. Actually, this peasant restiveness was a continuation of a for mer struggle which or igin¬ ated more than eighty-years back in the upland and lowland to wns of Cavite and other Tagalog to wns in Manila. What ag¬ gravated the already tense situation in Cavite were the for ced labor and exaction of tribute in the form of firewood for use in the Imus church construction. In fact, the so-called “tulisanes” (bandits) were really the troubled peasants whose survival depend¬ ed solely on the lands disposessed by the uldogs (hacienda lay- administrator). Parang and Upay temporarily surrendered to authorities through amnesty in 1828, but resumed their uprising in the 1830 s. Parang finally met his death by execution in 1835. Cavite experienced another resurgence of agrarian trouble in the mid-1860 s against the land abuses of the friars, with Casi- miro Camerino, an Imus farmer unjustly labeled “El Tulisan” by the Spaniards, heading a peasant uprising with his other dis¬ enchanted followers. He was warmly supported by the Cavitenos 114 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE who knew the reasons for his defiance. In 1869, he was person¬ ally granted amnesty at the Imus hacienda by no less than the Governor Carlos Maria de la Torre himself, and some of his men were assigned to the rural police force called Compama de Guias de la Provincia de Cavite, with appropriate salaries. Camerino became the colonel of the force. Implicated in the Cavite Mutiny, he was executed by the garrote vil (death by strangulation using an iron-collar which replaced death by hanging which was abolish¬ ed in 1832). E. The Moro Resistance.—The active resistance against the Spaniards heightened from 1718 to 1762, and from 1850 s to 1878, during the so-called “Moro Wars”. Starting with the reestablishment of Fort Pilar in Zamboanga in 1718, the Spaniards failed miserably to subjugate the Moros in the 1750 s. This was the time that the Iranuns and the Maranaos of Lanao commenced their relentless ravaging pillages in the Visayas which caused economic stagnation in many parts of the islands under the sway of the Spanish rule"

This was the time that the Iranuns and the Maranaos of Lanao commenced their relentless ravaging pillages in the Visayas which caused economic stagnation in many parts of the islands under the sway of the Spanish rule. Thousands of Christians were captured during the Moro raids, resulting in the decimation of population in the Visayas. These “Moro raids” were in retaliation for Spanish acts of reducing Moro captives to slavery and razing their homes, landed and personal properties to the ground. The British capture of Manila in 1762, and the pockets of resistance in Luzon and the Visayas temporarily reduced Spanish at tention on Mindanao and Sulu. By the nineteenth century, Sulu became the the ater of operations of Anglo-French rivalry, with the latter eyeing a sea base on Basilan in the 1850 s at the time when the English were reactivating their trade with the Tausugs started earlier in the eighteenth century. By 1876, Jolo had surrendered to Spain, and the “Moro Wars” were carried out mainly through the jura- ment ado or sabil allah ritual suicide at tacks, commencing an open resistance to the unwanted Spanish occupation of their ancestral lands. Failure of the Revolts.-“All the earlier resistance which occurred almost in cyclical pattern were failures. Because of the in sular makeup of the Philippines, the early Filipinos were con¬ ditioned to live and feel apart from each other for almost 333 years. There was no sense of national unity. As consequence, there was a wide communication gap between the Filipinos of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, particularly with those living in in accessible areas. There were a multitude of major and minor ethnolinguistic groups but no lingua franca, much less a national FROM “INDIO\" TO “FILIPINO\" 115 language, to communicate and bind one another. Although there were a number of colonial laws passed on the teaching of the Castilian langugage, the Spanish bureaucrats, spearheaded by the friars, deliberately refused to teach and promote their language among the Filipinos. They simply reasoned out that there was a lack of language materials as artes (grammars) and vocabularios, an absence of a teaching strategy for an alien to ngue, and above all, a lack of qualified teachers of the language. Behind this smokescreen, of course, was the fear of the Spanish friars that a Filipino who knew the Castilian language became better educated and, the refore, a future subversive or a filibustero. Filipino Nationalism: Decelerators.—Louis L. Snyder defines nationalism as... a condition of mind, feeling, or sentiment of a group of people living in a well-defined geographical area, speaking a common language, possessing a literature in which the aspirations of the nation have been expressed, being at tached to common traditions, and, in some cases, having a common religion... The ideas of nationalism, a product of the French Revolu¬ tion in the eighteenth century, filtered through the Philippines only in the nineteenth century. Indeed, there was no national feeling during the precolonial times. Although united as one in a geographical unit called Las Islas Filipinos during the Spanish rule, the people called Filipinos applied only to the Spaniards bom in the Philippines (in sulares), and the in digenes were dero- gatorily called in dios (like the Amerindians of the Americas). The in dios were not united in words and in deeds, as the Spanish church and state of ficials, mainly the friars, divided and ruled the natives. Thus, the “‘in dios” became a “Filipino” only during the the last years of the Spanish regime in the late 1890 s. The divide et impera (divide and rule) colonial policy not only quelled the revolts of Filipinos by Filipinos the mselves, but also by for eign mercenaries like the Macabebes (who belonged to Yaqui Aztec tribe), the merdekas from Maluku, or the Japan¬ ese. In this connection may also be ment ioned the superior military technology and strategy utilized by the conquistadores, such as the use of Mexican horses, better firing projectile weapons such as culverins, cannons, muskets or guns vis-a-vis the primitive and simpler native weaponry of rocks, bamboo caltrops, pit and spear traps, spears, lantakas (rentakas) and non-firing side-arms 116 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of boloes, kampilans, and krises. The co-optation of the Filipino chiefly class with the Spanish church and state of ficials who granted them special benefits also added to the failure of revolts. With disunity, absence of good leaders who know military strategy and tactics, a network of spies, enforcement of the use of pape- letas de permiso (of ficial travel permits) and cartas de radio (safe-conduct passes) which controlled free movement of natives and, of course, the presence of the Spanish priests who meddled in the uprising, all the Filipino efforts proved futile. Filipino Nationalism: Accelerators.—The filtering through of progressive political ideologies and the transfer of technology to the Philippines through liberal-minded men from Europe and America, along with disenchantment with Madre Espaha., catalyzed Filipino nationalism in the nineteenth century. Tired of being “only an in dividual... and not a member of a nation,” the Filipino, particularly the social elites, finally woke up to the realization that he must change. Change finally came about, stimulated by the opening of the Philippines to world commerce, with the at tendant rise of the clase media. Various factors such as the impact of European liberalism and the administration of Carlos Maria de la Torre, racial discrimination, the effects of the secular-regular conflicts, and the Cavite Mutiny of 1872, all con¬ tributed to the birth of Filipino nationalism.

A. The Philippines in World Commerce (1834-1898)— Manila proper and the suburban areas developed by leaps and bounds with the of ficial and permanent opening of the her port to in ternational trade in 1834, resulting in tremendous socio¬ economic changes for the Filipino. Indeed, the nineteenth cen¬ tury brought a great transformation from the preceding centuries of economic stagnation created by the monopolistic policy of Spain. Despite economic restrictions, for eign consulates were already established before and after 1834; Russia and the United States since 1817, France and Germany (representing Hamburg and Bremen) in 1835; Great Britain in 1844, and Japan in 1888. Following Sinibaldo de Mas* proposal, the provincial ports of Sual (Pangasinan), Iloilo and Zamboanga were also opened in 1855; Cebu in 1860, followed by Legaspi and Leyte in 1873. With the opening of these ports ensued greater demands for export crops such as rice, sugar, abaca, to bacco, and in digo, where Filipino and Chinese mestizo social elites profited highly. In 1810, the to tal value of Philippine exports was only P 4,795,000 which in creased to P 9,213,000, in 1856; P 28,000,000, in 1870; FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 117 and P 33,149,984, by 1894. On the one hand, her imports for 1810, were worth P 5,329,000; P 6,959,000, in 1856; P 23,500,000, in 1870, and P 28,558,552, in 1894, which proves that there was an improvement in the balance of trade since 1810, when Manila was still closed to world trade. However, in spite of this seemingly economic prosperity, the Mexican silver dollar (peso) was devalued in 1875. In 1810, the peso was worth $1,030 (U. S.) $1,056, in 1856; $1,043 in 1870, plummeting to only $.976 in 1875 and $.531, when the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896... \\ Mail service between Manila and Cavite started as early as 1839, although postage stamps were used for the first time only some fifteen years later. Travelers in the 1880 s in Manila made reservations at the Hotel de Oriente in Binondo, the first of its kind in the Spanish colony. Of two storeys, with 83 rooms, it kept a stable good for 25 horses. Fonda de Lala (Fonda Francesa) owned by Lala Ari, an Anglo-Indian, also in Binondo, however, was considered the best hotel, good for 35 guests “with board and lodging in cluding ice”. Banking facilities were transacted at the Banco Espanol-Fili- pino de Isabel //, the first Philippine bank which issued the first paper money in 1852, and two other British-owned banks. Savings of Manilans were kept in the Monte de Piedad 30 years later. The first daily newspaper appeared in 1846. By then, the Chinese at Calle Rosario (now Quintin Paredes Street) were peddling illegal for eign-made pornographic pictures, even as smuggling of smut literature was banned as early as 1857. Men of leisure usually relaxed in any of these establishments: horseracing at the one-lane Manila Jockey Club in the late 1860 s which stretched from San Sebastian Church to Quiapo, (transferred later to Santa Mesa) and bullfighting in Paco (relocated later to Pasay). Those with discriminating tastes had at least four choices of the at ers: the Teatro Filipino in Calle Echague (now Carlos Palanca) in Quiapo; the Circo de Bilibid; the Teatro Zorilla on Calle Iris (now Recto Avenue); and the Teatro de Colon. In these playhouses, popular zarzuelas were staged by Filipino and Spanish playwrights as well as classical operas performed by famous visiting European artists of the time. During this period, Andres Bonifacio, • also as its apuntador (prompter), set up the Teatro de Porvenir on Reina Regente Street where he and his brothers, 118 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Procopio and Ciriaco, and Macario Sakay acted in the moro-moro. Movies were shown for the first time at the Sal 6 n de Pertierra at the Escolta in 1897, featuring short French films at the price of 50 centavos for a cushioned seat and 30 centavos for benches (lunetas). B. Rise of the Clase Media.—As a result of the great eco¬ nomic transformation in the life of the Filipino, a middle class (clase media) of Asian and Eurasian mestizos emerged in the Philippine social pyramid. The clase media emerged from the economic boom derived from expanded agriculture and com¬ merce embarked on by the rising native entrepreneurs. They for med the town principalia, an elite social group composed of for mer gobernadorcillos and minor native bureaucrats own¬ ing at least P 50.00 in land taxes, decorated personnel, and school¬ masters. Personal possessions, as it were in the nineteenth century, as well as education, became in dicators of social status in a com¬ munity. The size, construction materials and location of one’s house in the town’s calle real (main street) improved one’s status. Of course, evidences of wealth and prestige, as ownership of livestock, sugarmills, imported furniture and tableware, and use of honorary titles “Don” and “Doha”, enhanced the social stand¬ ing of the local elites. Even the make and number of carriage wheels and horses that drew them were social gauges. Only the town principalia and cura parroco owned such vehicles. Pianos, for in stance, were imported in 1893 for P 6,207.00, in creasing as much as P 8,378.00 the following year. In 1893 the volume of furniture imported was 106,014 pounds valued at P 42,479.00; in 1894 the volume were up to 429,019 pounds worth P 33,863.00. The rise of the clase media was highly visible in the residential or ganization of Manila society. Intramuros, up to the turn of the nineteenth century, served as the politico-religious center of the Spanish enclave in the Philippines. Within the walls was the largest Iberian community seen in the Islands throughout the Spanish regime"

The rise of the clase media was highly visible in the residential or ganization of Manila society. Intramuros, up to the turn of the nineteenth century, served as the politico-religious center of the Spanish enclave in the Philippines. Within the walls was the largest Iberian community seen in the Islands throughout the Spanish regime. In the pre-nineteenth century, only the Spaniards and their Filipino wives, permanent domestics and their carriage drivers could live within the confines of the walled city. San Miguel, part of Quiapo in the late eighteenth century, was the second concentration of Spaniards and other European business tycoons, and was considered the most fashionable district in the Philippines at the time. Sampaloc, with its elegant stonehouses FROM ‘i NDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 119 and a town of noted printers, equally contained a large elite population. Outside of the walls (extramuros) were the Filipino, Chinese and mestizo communities concentrated in different areas. The mestizo and Filipino social elites’ choices were either Binondo, Ermita, San Jose de Trozo or Quiapo. In the 1870 s, Binondo was the biggest, as it was the business sector in the province of Manila, where Don Santiago de los Santos (“Capitan Tiago’V of Rizal’s Noli me tangere resided. Quiapo, known for its Black Nazarene, was the residence of Filipino government clerks, artists and merchants. Tondo, then described as “all slums” was the major residential area of the Filipino close pobre: the lower working class engaged in to bacco and cigar-making, fishing, and gardening for Manila’s local consumption. The Parian de los Sangleyes outside the Intramuros was reserved only for the un¬ converted Chinese and was relocated at least ten times at different periods and sites between 1581 and 1790, which in cluded Meisic, a corrupted form of may in sik. Binondo, on the north side of the Pasig served as the second Chinese “ghetto” of the Catholic Chinese and the mestizo de sangleyes. C. European Liberalism and Carlos Maria de la Torre.—We can not discount that not only men, but also ideas filtered to the Philippines with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Thus, the travel between Spain and the islands was made shorter, safer, and speedier. It not only “dispelled to some extent the at mos¬ phere of the middle ages” in which the Filipinos “were wrapped,” according to Pardo de Tavera, but “modem ideas of liberty began to penetrate the minds of the natives.” We may add that the Filipino migration abroad, the arrival of Spaniards in Manila whose point-of-view had been changed by the teachings of the French Revolution of “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” and the democratic in fluences which emanated from the United States, all contributed to erase from the minds of certain Filipinos “the pernicious and false ideas regarding human rights which up to that time had dominated most of those educated in the old methods.” Interestingly enough, the political term “liberal” was first used in Spain and first referred to the Spanish rebels of 1820. In the Philippines, the ideas of liberalism may be traced to the secondary and tertiary education made available to the Filipinos in 1863. For in stance, the bulk of the curriculum in a college in the 1870 s followed by one taking up courses in law, medicine, 120 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and the ology consisted of liberal arts studies, where Filipinos were taught the rights of citizens and the duties of the govern¬ ment. Two philosophers of the Age of Reason left in delible marks on the Filipino in telligentsia of the nineteenth century: John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Locke in his Two Treatises on Government (1689) posited that the social contract between the king, who did not exercise absolute powers, and his subjects, means that if the king failed to do his duty and did not respond to natural rights, his subjects had the right to overthrow him. Rousseau re-echoed the same principle in The Social Con¬ tract (1762), agreeing that if a government did not satisfy its subjects, they have all the reason to alter the government to whatever they thought best. The “Glorious September Revolution” of 1868 in Spain meant a new or der with the arrival of the liberal Governor De la Torre, succeeding Manuel Maldonado. In fact, the motto “Los hijos de los leones son tambi Sn leones” (“Lion cubs are also lions”) was spread far and wide by the partisans and sympathizers of the Spanish Republicans in the Philippines. However, De la Torre proved to be very unpopular with the Manila Spaniards and, of course, with the Spanish regular clergy, who overtly demonstrated their aversion for him. De la Torre dispensed with his alabarderos (halbeldiers), the governor’s security guards since 1590, and went unescorted. He even used an or dinary straw hat, abrogated flogging for Fili¬ pino deserters in the Spanish for ces, and supplanted the penalty, in stead, with a month in jail. He abolished press espionage and proclaimed freedom of speech. To top it all, even went to the extent of meeting the peasant rebel leader, Casimiro Camerino, in the Imus hacienda. He shocked the Manila Spaniards when he led a group of Filipino elites in a to ast to liberty. However, it was quite ironic that in spite of all these alleged overt liberal reforms, Carlos Maria de la Torre, like all previous Spanish governors, covertly gave confidential in structions a few months after his arrival, to in tercept suspect mail coming from Europe and Hongkong of prominent Filipino leaders and priests, in cluding Fr. Jose Burgos. He even went to the extent of or dering secret in vestigations to “procure evidence against them”. Indeed, De la Torre was responsible for the arrest and imprisonment of the student leader of the Juventud Escolar Liberal, Felipe Buen- camino, who with Paciano Rizal and Gregorio Sanciangco, headed FROM “INDIO*’ TO “FILIPINO” 121 the student protest movement at the University of Santo Tomas demanding reforms in the school administration.

D. Racial Discrimination.—There is an abundance of do¬ cumentary proof on racism in the Philippines during the Spanish period. “Although the laws recognized no difference between the various races,” commented Pardo de Tavera, “nevertheless from the beginning of the nineteenth century the Spaniards claimed superiority over the Filipinos, and so taught their children.” He elucidates further by saying that A The to wnspeople were obliged to remove their hats when a Spaniard passed, and this was especially the case if he occupied some of ficial position; if the Spaniard happened to be a priest; in addition to the removal of the hat the native was obliged to kiss his hand. No Indian [i. e., Filipino] was allowed to sit at the same table with a Spaniard, even though the Spaniard was a guest in the Indian’s house. The Spaniards addressed the Filipinos [i. e., Spaniards bom in the Philippines] by the pronoun “thou”, and although many of the Spaniards married pure blood native women, the wives were always looked down on in society as belonging to an in ferior class. The in tensity of animosities between the Filipinos and Span¬ iards, especially the friars, reached the highest point with the Reform Movement, when anti-Filipino writers like Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante, Francisco Canamaque, Pablo Feced, and Wenceslao E. Retana, wrote vitriolic literature denigrating the Filipinos. Filipinos were maligned and degraded as “neither a merchant nor an in dustrial, neither a farmer nor a philosopher” or that it was “logical that the Indians, in their immense majority, should receive, from friars and seculars, the epithet of chongos. ” The most virulent at tack on the Filipino race came from the Franciscan Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante’s Si Tandang Basio Macunat (Manila, 1885) who opined that the Filipino could never learn the Spanish language or be civilized. With utmost biases, he differentiated the Spaniards from the Filipino by saying that: “The Spaniards will always be a Spaniard, and the in dio will always be an in dio... The monkey will always be a monkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers, and will always be a monkey and not human”. In fact, the Filipino, he believed, must remain tied to his carabao: “The Tagalog, that is, 1 22 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Filipino, who separates from his carabao, frequently, be¬ comes bad and in grate before his God and King.” Francisco Canamaque, several times Spain’s Undersecretary of State, in his works like Las Islas Filipinas (Madrid, 1880), hated the laziness and in capacity of Filipinos. Pablo Feced (“Quioquiap\") was a journalist noted for his open hatred for Filipinos as shown in his Filipinas; esbozos y pinceladas (Manila, 1888), describing the rural folks as “carabao herd” and even quoting Fr. Gaspar de San Agustin, an Augustinian, who said that “God created the in dios to gether with the rattan,” meaning that the Filipinos “need beatings and the rattan.” E. Regular-Secular Conflicts. Secularization of the parishes was nothing more than the transfer of ministries established or run by the regular clergy to the seculars. By the midst of the nineteenth century, secularization was transmuted into a political and separatist movement which exploded in the Filipinization of the church, and culminated in the separation of the church from Rome during the Philippine Revolution. \\ As early as 1583, Philip II proclaimed that parish adminis¬ tration pertained to the seculars. If there was enough supply of competent secular clergy, preference should be given to them in the establishment of missions. In 1753, Ferdinand VI pro¬ claimed that there were enough competent seculars to supplant the regulars in parish functions so that they could replace them immediately upon vacancy. This was duly amended four years after. Unfortunately, the cedulas of 1753 were not implemented, for in deed, Ferdinand VI did not actually in tend to secularize the parishes, but to put the regular clergy in stead under diocesan visitation and royal patronage. Actual secularization of the parishes took place during the tenure of Archbishop Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Rufina (1767-87). According to Fr. Jose Burgos in his “Manifiesto que a la noble nacion espahola ” (1864), it was the friars who “have been utilizing the in famous use of undervaluing the capacity and fitness of the Filipino Clergy so as to make the mselves perpetual curates in the Islands.” He described Archbishop Sancho de Santa^Justa y Rufina as “wise and very worthy”. The Filipino, “by reason of his idiosyncracies, his character,” according to a biased Spanish writer, is “good” only as a subordinate. However, the scholarly studies of Dr. Luciano P. R. Santiago disprove otherwise the notions perpetuated by both for eign and Filipino writers about FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 123 the capacity of the “in dio ” priests. He finally debunked the old the ory “that no native Filipino, or Indio, priest was or dained be¬ fore the 1720’s,” proving, for example, that the first known in dio priest was B. D. Francisco Baluyot (1698) of the so-called “first group” (1698-1706) of native clergy. He also noted that earlier in seventeenth century, there were already Eurasian and in dio priests, like Don Agustin Tabuyo of Cagayan (1621) and B. D. Miguel Jeronimo of Pampanga (1655). With the Jesuit expulsion in 1768, a number of their parishes were taken over by the seculars in Manila, Cavite, and the Visayas"

With the Jesuit expulsion in 1768, a number of their parishes were taken over by the seculars in Manila, Cavite, and the Visayas. In 1774, the Augustinians, who were for cibly deprived by Governor Simon de Anda of seventeen parishes in Pampanga which were given to Filipino seculars, filed a complaint before the Spanish crown. Anda was or dered in the same year to restore said Pampanga parishes, even as the King secularized the parishes with the proviso that one or two of the more affluent parishes in each province should remain with the regulars. What the secular clergy believed to have been outright u- surpation of the newly-established curacies of Santa Rosa (La¬ guna) by the Dominicans and Imus (Cavite) and Las Pinas (Manila) by the Recollects ignited further the age-old secular-regular conflicts. By 1803, the three named Tagalog parishes were given back promptly to the seculars, even as the governor-general as vice-regal patron, declined to follow the ecclesiastical cabildo's petition to the crown that the parishes continue under the regular clergy’s control. In 1822, Malate, for merly under the Augustinian domain, was transferred to a secular priest. With the Latin American revolutions for in dependence, Spain witnessed a complete alteration of her secularization policy by 1826 when all the parishes sequestered from the friars in the eighteenth century were restored to them. There was seemingly no antagonism raised against the decree of 1826, but this was not the case when the March 9,1849 edict gave seven new curacies in Cavite to the Recollects and Dominicans. Two Filipino priests, Fr. Pedro Pelaez in Manila, and Fr. Mariano Gomez in Cavite, stood as the trailblazers in the nationalist movement among the native clergy. To the Filipino clergy the height of in justice was the 1861 decrees which relinquished most of the secular-run parishes to the Recollects, as reparation for the Mindanao curacies granted to 124 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Jesuits, who returned in 1859. This meant additional re¬ duction to the already dwindling number of parishes under Fili¬ pino seculars. In the eyes of the Filipinos, this was a deliberate Spanish government ploy to dishearten and thwart the develop¬ ment of the native clergy. Exactly a decade later, only 181 out of 792 curacies were Filipino-controlled. In fact, secular-regular conflicts arose in the Antipolo and San Rafael parish-grabbing cases, left vacant by their secular priests who died. Antipolo, famous for its brown virgin, was considered not only as “la perla de los Curatos'\\ but also as “one of the richest [parishes] in the Archipelago,” as it was, and still is, one of the traditional May¬ time pilgrimage sites, when “so numerous and valuable... gifts [were] of fered in the masses” by her devotees. San Rafael in Bulacan, claimed by the Recollects, was part of a hacienda or igin¬ ally owned in the eighteenth century by San Juan de Dios. It was then peopled only by some 80 Filipinos as cowtenders and farmers but by 1870, when claimed by the Augustinians, its in come had been in creased by 13,000 parishioners. During this time, there were 792 curacies, 181 held by the seculars, and 611 by the regulars. So embittered were the Filipino seculars as a consequence of the prejudicial and unilateral provisions of the 1849 and 1861 decrees that Archbishop Gregorio Meliton Martinez of Manila was compelled to write an expose to Marshal Francisco Serrano, regent of Spain in 1870, “to maintain the tranquility of his diocese, which has been frequently disturbed as a result of the practice... of turning over curacies administered by the secular clergy to the religious corporations. This policy is the cause of an ever growing enmity which is becoming more and more manifest between seculars and regulars, and which, sooner or later, may bring lamentable results to our beloved Spain...” Less than two years later, the Cavite Mutiny of 1872 ex¬ ploded, as if the Archbishop had prophesied it. Indeed, the native priests were truly “political dynamites.” F. La Algarada Cavitena, 1872.-The Cavite Mutiny broke out during the tenure of Rafael de Izquierdo who had dramatic¬ ally, said upon his arrival, “I shall govern with a cross on one hand a sword in the other.” Galvanized by discontent against the Spaniards, some 200 Filipino soldiers, joined in by some workers in the arsenal of the artillery corps led by Sgt. La Madrid, guard at Fort San Felipe, mutinied in the night of January 1872. In FROM “INDIO” TO “FILIPINO” 125 the ensuing melee, La Madrid himself was “blinded and badly burned” when a sack of gunpowder exploded, killing him in stantaneously while trapped in side the fort.

These were abruptly abrogated by the new governor (Izquierdo). Unpaid wages and the unjust payment to the to bacco planters for harvests in Cavite in 1870- 1871 added to the already sizzling feeling of discontent. In fact, this revolt was believed by one contemporary Spanish writer to have stemmed from the workers’ strike (huelga) of the Cavite Arsenal, the first ever recorded in the Philippines, and probably one of the earliest in the Far East"

Some scholars even at tri¬ buted the mutiny to racial discrimination between the Filipino non-commissioned soldiers and those of the new peninsular Spanish armed for ces, for the latter received higher ranks, pay, and even enjoyed better food rations following the new Izquierdo policy. Although the revolt was localized, the Spanish authorities viewed the event as an overturning of the colonial rule in the Islands, even considering it as part of a greater national move¬ ment to liberate the Philippines from Spain. Fr. Mariano Gomez of Bacoor, Cavite, Fr. Jose Burgos and Fr. Jacinto Zamora of the Manila Cathedral, were unjustly accused as agitators of the anti-Spanish movement. However, until the time they were executed by the garrote vil, Archbishop Meliton Martinez refused to defrock Gomburza, as per Izquierdo’s or iginal in struction, although the triumvirate were threatened with excommunication by the same archbishop in his pastoral letter. Archbishop Mar¬ tinez even or dered the to lling of the bells of Manila churches as a luneral dirge for the souls of the departed priests. Their corpses were clandestinely transported to the Paco cemetery in Manila and there dumped into a common grave in an unmarked site which up to now has not been successfully located. 126 A,;., HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Rizal no less observed the significance of the Cavite revolt, when he wrote in 1889, that... it may be possible to stimulate another revolt like that of Cavite and then, because of it, cut off the heads of many educated persons, but from the blood spilled, fresher and more shoots will sprout. Before the catastrophe of 1872, there were less thoughtful people, less anti-friars; they sacrificed in nocent victims; but now you have the young, the women, and the young ladies declaring the mselves in favor of the same cause. Repeat the sacrifice and the executioners will be sealing their own fate. •j* fj» *3* ^ ^ ^ PART III REFORM AND REVOLUTION 8 THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS The unjust execution of the three Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora was a turning point in Philippine history, for it ushered in a new era — the reform movement. Realizing the danger of fighting for their cause on the home front, the sons of the wealthy and the well-to-do Fili¬ pino families migrated to Europe to breathe the free at mosphere of the Old World. There they in itiated a sustained campaign for reforms in the administration of the Philippines. In the homeland, meanwhile, the Filipino in tellectuals secretly colla¬ borated with those in Spain and founded nationalistic societies. For more than a decade the Filipino propagandists waged their war of propaganda against the Spanish authorities and friars, but they failed to awaken the Government of the Peninsula to the demoralizing realities of colonial administration. The reform movement was a failure in that it did not achieve its goals. In another sense, however, it was a success, for its failure led to the founding of the revolutionary Katipunan with separatist aims. The Role of the Middle Class.—The economic development of the Philippines in the nineteenth century led to the rise of the Filipino middle class. Non-existent in previous centuries, the middle class, composed of Spanish and Chinese mestizos, rose to a position of power in the Filipino community and eventually became leaders in finance and education. With the change in status they hankered for of ficial or bureaucratic power to make their position in the social pyramid more secure and in fluential. But the Spanish authorities looked down upon them, for they did not belong to the in ner circle of peninsulares — Spaniards born in Spain — whose prerogative it was to rule and govern. This at titude was not surprising, for Spanish society in the Philippines was a sort of caste consisting of two well- defined classes: the peninsulares or Spaniards born in Spain and the in sulares or Spaniards born in the Philippines. The contempt with which the for mer dealt with the latter arose 129 130 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE from a feeling* that anybody bom in the Philippines was ipso facto in ferior. Thus, to show their contempt for the in sulares, the peninsulares called the for mer Filipinos. The “natives”, on the other hand, were in variably called in dios. It was not until Governor-General Basilio Augustin called for the loyalty and aid of the “in dios” in 1898 that the latter were called Filipinos. Before 1898, then, the Filipinos were called in dios and the in¬ sulares Filipinos. Thwarted in their at tempts to win a “place in the sun”, the members of the middle class started, almost unobtrusively, the movement for reforms. There was no alternative: the Spanish authorities looked down upon them with condescension, if not in deed with contempt, while the “natives” looked upon them with suspicion — the “natives” having been, and continued to be, the victims of the mestizos' arrogant and in solent mannerisms. Between the two evils — the contempt of the Spaniards and the suspicion of the “natives” the middle class chose the lesser evil, that is, the natives. It was thus that the Filipino middle class and the “natives” came to work hand in hand, with the for mer naturally leading the latter by the hand. The chance of the middle class to show their political color came when General Carlos Maria de la Torre became governor in 1869. Identified with the revolutionary for ces in Spain, de la Torre showed his democratic tendencies when he dismissed the palace halberdiers, lived simply within his means, walked the streets in mufti, and abolished flogging as a punishment"

Lively and highly in telligent, he took to writing early in life, producing a tale entitled Fray Botod. This work, which deals with the ignorance, abuses, and immorality of a certain friar named Bo¬ tod, circulated in manuscript form. Its existence, however, could not be hidden for long, and Lopez Jaena found himself the object of a manhunt. Why so? Because he delineated the average friar of the period — fat (botod is the Hiligaynon word for a big-bellied man, the equivalent of the Tagalog slang botyok), ignorant, abusive, and immoral. The friars saw in his Fray Botod their own picture, and nothing excites the anger of man more than to be ridiculed in public. There was only one way out of the tight fix Lopez Jaena was in: to leave the Philippines. In 1880, he secretly left for Spain, and enrolled in medicine at the University of Valencia. He later transferred to Madrid, where he found the at mosphere congenial, for he loved light and shadows, the clubs and the cafes, and the jour¬ nalists of the capital. In social and political clubs, he dis¬ tinguished himself as a great or ator. His speeches and or at ions were, however, almost always about the condition of the Philip¬ pines or a defense of the Filipinos against the malignant charges of Spanish hacks. One of his greatest or at or ical triumphs oc¬ curred in Madrid in 1882 during the celebration of the Inter¬ national Congress of Commercial Geography. On that occasion, a friar, Fr. Ramon Martinez Vigil, who had been to the Philip¬ pines and had written an article on the ancient Tagalog script, was praising the friars for their “benevolent” role in the Philip¬ pines when all of a sudden Ldpez Jaena stood up and delivered a defense of the Filipinos. At the same time, he denounced vigorously the role of the friars in in troducing and maintain¬ ing obscurantism in the Philippines and in obstructing the prog¬ ress of the people. Somewhat like Lord Byron, L 6 pez Jaena woke up the next morning to find himself famous. THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 133 Triumph followed upon triumph. The following year, 1883, at the Teatro de Madrid, on the 391 st anniversary of the “dh covery” of America, Lopez Jaena, in the presence of the diplomatic corps, prominent men in politics, arts, and letters, and distinguished ladies, delivered an impassioned speech in which he called America the brains of the commercial world and the Philippines the heart in which “all the arteries, all the veins of the in dustrial and commercial wealth converge...” At the same time, he pointed out that the Filipinos did not want a semi-feudal state; neither did they want the friars who represented “oppression, in to lerance, and fanaticism.” But yes, they, the Filipinos, wanted a free press and the right to be represented in the Cortes so that their aspirations could be considered by them and recognized by the Government of Spain. There was wild applause after his speech, and the Venezuelan Minister to Spain, Dr. Calcano, sprang to his feet and embraced Lopez Jaena in the name of Latin America. In 1889, sensing the necessity of a newspaper to promote the in terests of the Philippines and the Filipinos, the Filipino reformists founded the newspaper La Solidaridad. The first number of this periodical came out on February 15, with Pablo Rianzares as financier and Lopez Jaena as editor. The aims of La Solidaridad, as expressed in its in itial editorial, follow: Our aspirations are modest, very modest. Our program, aside from being simple, is clear: to combat reaction, to stop all retrogressive steps, to extol and adopt liberal ideas, to defend progress; in a word, to be a propagandist, above all, of democratic ideas in or der to make these supreme in all nations here and across the seas. The aims, the refore, of La Solidaridad are described as to collect, to gather libertarian ideas which are manifested daily in the field of politics, science, art, literature, commerce, agriculture, and in dustry. We shall also discuss all problems relating to the general in terest of the nation and seek solutions to those problems in high-level and democratic manner. * * * With regard to the Philippines, since she needs the most help, not being represented in the Cortes, we shall pay particular at tention to the defense of her democratic rights, the accomplishment of which is our patriotic duty. 134 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE That nation of eight million souls should not, must not be the exclusive preserve of the ocracy and traditionalism. The Sol, as the newspaper was lovingly referred to by the reformists, became the mouthpiece of the Filipinos in Spain. It published not only news but also essays and articles about the Philippines and the Filipinos. In 1891, at Barcelona, Lopez Jaena collected his speeches and articles and published them in book form under the title Discursos y Arttculos Varios. It is to the credit of Lopez Jaena that he in itiated the reform movement which gathered strength as the years rolled on. So great was he as an or ator that even Spaniards admired his command of their own language. He was fiery, and no one would suspect that such a man of small stature and slovenly habits could sway the masses of men to his side by the power of the spoken word. He was slovenly and careless, as was said of him by his friends, so much so that he ate sardines with his fingers which he dutifully cleaned afterwards by the simple expedient of wiping them with his coat. He was almost always in rags, and the Filipino colony in Spain felt ashamed of him and his eccentricities. Mariano Ponce used to buy suits for him, but Lopez Jaena was so enamored of his old and dirty ones that he implored Ponce not to throw them away. Then he would pawn his new suits and promptly return to his beloved rags. Yet anyone reading any of his speeches or articles would easily feel the impact of his hidden personality. For he had the power and the genius of a bom or ator. That is why his eccentricities, while shameful, were easily for given and for got¬ ten, for when he spoke he shone with a halo of saintliness. This was proved once more when, in vited to lecture at the Ateneo de Barcelona, he conjured hp imaginary facts in such a manner as to convince his hearers of the truth of what he was saying. When his Filipino friends pulled his coat to call his at tention to his wanton display of irresponsibility, he ignored them and con¬ tinued dishing out more imaginary facts. When after the lecture his friends chided him for his in ventions, he calmly answered: “If what I have said was not true, no one among those present could belie me either, because on that subject they are as ignorant as I am.” As editor of the So/, Lopez Jaena did not receive any salary. His only compensation was free lodging, meals, clothing, and a little pocket money for trivial expenses. To make him write"

In the caf£ where he spent most of his waking hours, Lopez Jaena would sit idly, or der cups of wine, and magnificently allow others to spend for him. Here in the cafe, his friends would give him sheets of paper on which to write his pieces, and surprisingly enough, he wrote with ease when his head was full of spirits. It was in this charac¬ teristic manner that he wrote most of his speeches and articles. But such mode of living, such ment al vigor with out any rest and sufficient nutriment, could only lead to physical break¬ down. Tuberculosis stepped in and challenged his or at ory to drive it out of his lungs. But Lopez Jaena was too weak to reply effectively, and on January 20, 1896, in Barcelona, the great Filipino passed on as a living memory. MARCELO H. DEL PILAR, the political analyst of the Filipino colony in Spain, was bom in the barrio of Kupang, Bulakan, Bulakan, on August 30, 1850, the son of Julian H. del Pilar and Blasa Gatmaitan. His father was a poet of sorts and from him Marcelo in herited his love for the arts. As a young man, he studied at the College of San Jose and later at the University of Santo Tomas, where he finished his law course in 1880. His sense of justice led him early in life to campaign against the abuses of the friars, and since there was no free¬ dom of speech and of the press at the time he paid for his te¬ merity with a month’s imprisonment. In 1878, he married his first cousin, Marciana del Pilar, by whom he had several children, with only Anita and Sofia surviving. Marcelo began his career as his country’s evangelist in 1880 when he took to the field to campaign against the for ces that stifled freedom and progress in the Philippines. He made the plaza and the cockpits, even the small tiendas, his platform, preaching the gospel of work, self-respect, and dignity. He was a master of Tagalog and in this language he tried to arouse the consciousness of the masses to the necessity of acting as a unified people. In 1882, he founded the nationalistic newspaper Diariong Tagalog. He wrote of patriotism and the sad state of the country. The newspaper, however, did not live long enough to become a major force in Filipino society. Nevertheless, del Pilar carried his^personal campaign against the abuses of the Spaniards to the different barrios and to wns of Bulakan. Once, at a barrio fiesta, del Pilar heard a friar holding forth on the miracles of the saints. He asked the priest: “How many miraculous saints do we have in the Philippines?” “Todos, ” was the priest’s quick 136 HIS TORY OF IMF FILIIMNO PEOPLE reply. “Ah!” del Pilar said with out concealing his sarcasm. “In that case Spain ought to envy the Philippines, for here all saints are miraculous.” Not to be outwitted, the unsuspecting priest replied: “Even there in Spain, my son.” “But there in Spain,” Marcelo said, “the priests are not so miraculous as those in our country!” This statement drew the laughter of the crowd and the friar, embarrassed and humiliated, fled and called out the civil guard. But del Pilar was smart. He left hurriedly and dis¬ appeared among the crowd before the guards’ arrival. The year 1888 was significant to del Pilar, for it was in that year that he gave his life wholly to the propagation of uncommon, at least in the Philippines, ideas. He wrote pamphlet after pam¬ phlet ridiculing friar sovereignty and exposing the in justices committed almost daily against the Filipinos. In the same year, the Spanish friar, Jose’ Rodriguez, issued a series of pamphlets, denouncing Rizal and his Noli Me Tangere. One of these pam¬ phlets Caingat Cayo, savagely at tacked Rizal as an enemy of the holy Catholic religion. It described Rizal’s novel as a bad book which should not be read. Del Pilar- immediately jumped to the defense of Rizal by issuing his brilliant pamphlet Caingat Cayo, a searing in dictment of Rodriguez’s pamphlet, using the pen name Dolores Manapat. At the same time, the nationalistic Filipino priest, Vicente Garcfa, of Tanawan, Batangas, refuted Fr. Rodri¬ guez, using the pen name V. Caraig (V. Garcia). Not content with defending Rizal, Del Pilar wrote the with ering satire, Dasalan at Toksohan, a brilliant parody of the Prayer Book. Thus in “Amain Namin, ” a parody of “Our Father,” del Pilar said. Our uncle who art in the convent, cursed be the name, may we be delivered from thy greed, may thy throat be slit here on earth as it is in heaven. Give back this day our daily rice thou hast stolen from us and draw our laughter by thy lowing as thou laughest when thou stealest our money; and deliver us from thine temptation and save us from thine foul mouth. Amen. Del Pilar also parodied the Ten Commandments to ridicule the friars, the most potent single group in the Philippines. He called this particular work the “Ten Commandments of the Friars”, namely: 1. Thou shalt worship and love the friars above all. 2. Thou shalt not cheat them of their stipends. 3. Thou shalt sanctify the friar, Sundays or holidays. 4. Thou shalt pawn thyself to pay for the burial of thy father and mother. THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 137 5.

The Ten Commandments of the Friars boil down to two things: first, worship the friar above all, and second, of fer him thy honor and wealth. Aside from the satirical Dasalan at Toksohan, del Pilar wrote Dupluhan, Kadakilaan ng Dios, Pasiong Dapat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Tauong Babasa, Sagot nang Espaha sa Hibik nang Filipinas, Dudas, La Sobrenm Monacal, La Frailocracia Filipina, and scores of editorials and articles published in the Sol. His radical activities could no longer be to lerated by the Spanish authorities, who promptly or dered his arrest. But del Pilar skipped the country and left for Spain in October 1888. In December 1889, he took over the editorship of the Sol and became the moving spirit behind the reform movement. He to iled encessantly, writing, editing the Sol, and contacting progressive Spaniards who would fight side by side with the Filipino re¬ for mists. In the process he missed many a meal. In one of his editorials, he said: There is an aspiration for better life in the Philippines; the people who pay the taxes, the country that supports the Spanish flag with its farm and blood — this faithful country is aware that she is not composed of mere flock of sheep. This country does not ask any kind of sacrifice from Spain; all she asks is that she be governed well or ill, but with a full under¬ standing of causes, that the country be heard through legitimate means... We are asking for assimilation; we demand that those Islands be Hispanized... Under del Pilar, the aims of the Sol were expanded to in clude (1) the removal of the friars and the secularization of the parishes; (2) active participation in the affairs of the government; (3) free¬ dom of speech, of the press, and of assembly; (4) a wider social and political freedom; (5) equality before the law; (6) assimila¬ tion; and (7) representation in the Spanish Cortes, since the Filipinos had never been truly represented in that body. Spain, 138 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE however, had her own in ternal problems to look after and, there¬ fore, could not listen at tentively to the anguished cry of the Filipino reformers. Del Pilar became disillusioned and, on the eve of his death, switched his vigorous mind from assimilation to revolution. He said: “Insurrection is the last remedy, especially when the people have acquired the belief that peaceful means to secure the remedies for evils prove futile.” He planned to call the leaders of the reform movement to a meeting at Hong¬ kong in or der to take steps to ward the liberation of the country from Spanish tyranny. But he was gravely ill. He was missing his meals; cigarettes he had none; and to minimize the biting cold he would walk the streets of Barcelona to pick up cigarette butts to smoke. The Sol had no longer the funds necessary to continue the campaign for reforms. Rizal was already in Dapitan as an exile; Lopez Jaena was sick; so was Jose Panganiban. Del Pilar’s daughter Anita sent him a peso, but love and devotion alone could not stave off hunger. Friendliness and hungry, the great reformist and political analyst died on July 4, 1896. Upon his death, even his Spanish political adversaries paid him a homage. Said the Spanish newspaper La Politico de Espaha en Filipinas, the or gan of the friars: Marcelo del Pilar was the greatest journalist produced by the purely Filipino race. We did not consider him as an artful filbuster; at times we saw in him the calculating conspirator, the journalist gone astray, who had no real hatred for the sovereign country, though he showed he had it for the state of affairs prevailing in the Philippines. But whatever the truth may be, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was Marcelo... the Tagalog who, as publicist, in spired us with the greatest esteem when serenely, and apparently with the greatest sincerity, he gave his views on very arduous political problems. More correct in form than any other, skillful in debate, tena¬ cious in maintaining his conclusions, the personality of Marcelo del Pilar as a propagandist is doubtless the greatest produced by the Tagalog race. While he had not the culture and in tensity of purpose of his countryman, Rizal, he had, however, the advantage of knowing how to in still his thoughts in a subtle manner into the minds of his followers. JOSE RIZAL, the most cultured of the reformists, was bom in Kalamba, Laguna, on June 19, 1861, the son of Francisco Mercado and Teodor a Alonzo. A precocious child, he was alleged THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 139 to have written a Tagalog poem at the age of eight and entitled it “Sa Aking Kabata,” a poem that teaches love of one’s own language.

He studied for a time at the University of Santo Tomas, but in 1882, at the age of twenty-one, he left for Spain. He studied medicirie, read much oivmany subjects not in cluded in the medical curriculum, and mastered several languages, in cluding French and German. Now far from his country, he looked across the seas to find its strength as well as its weaknesses, and at the age of twenty-six he finished his novel Noli Me Tangere. This is a socio-historicai novel based on facts that he gathered while in the Philippines. The book is a novel only in the sense that the technique employed by the author is that of fiction. It is a mistake to suppose that because it was written in novel form it is, the refore, fiction. Rizal himself made this clear when, in a letter to the great Filipino painter, Felix Resurreccifin Hidalgo, he said: Noli Me Tdngere, words taken from the Gospel of St. Luke,1 signify “Do not to uch me.” The book contains things of which no one among ourselves has spoken up to the present; they are so delicate that they cannot be to uched by anybody. In so far as I am con¬ cerned, I have tried to do what nobody likes to do. I have endeavored to answer the calumnies which for centuries had been heaped on us and our country; I have described the social condition, the life, our beliefs, our hopes, our desires, our grievances, our griefs; I have unmasked hypocrisy which, under the guise of religion, came to impoverish and to brutalize us; I have distinguished the true religion from the false, from superstition, from that which trafficks 1 Actually, St. John. 140 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE with the holy word to extract money, to make us believe in sorcery, of which Catholicism would be ashamed if it were aware of it. * * * The facts I narrate are all true and actually happened; I can prove them. [Underscoring supplied.] The novel gained immediate popularity, but only a limited number of copies entered the Philippines, for the Spanish au¬ thorities, particularly the friars whom Rizal ridiculed in the novel, prohibited its reading. Anybody caught reading it was punished severely. The effect of the book on the Spaniards in the Philippines was tremendous, for in it they found their un¬ flattering images: all their defects, their ignorance, their im¬ morality, their bogus culture, and their vices were faithfully mirrored in the novel. As Dr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, a Spaniard born in the Philippines, said: All the defects of the public administration of affairs, the ignorance of the functionaries and their corruption, the vices of the clergy, the in capacity of the governors, and the in feriority of Spanish culture in these islands were made manifest. The prestige which the friars had enjoyed, and which was based only on the ignorance of the masses, crumbled away when the private lives of the members of the religious or ders in the provinces were described in the pages of Rizal’s book and the immorality and the viciousness of the friars were exposed to the public view. The defects in the system of education pursued in the colleges and in the Filipino university were also exposed and the evil results of the teaching fingered out. So vividly were the defects in the Spanish colonial administration described that the entire structure to ttered, and the prestige which Spanish civilization in the Islands had at tained up to that time in the minds of the Filipinos was completely discredited. The book was at tacked in all quarters of the Spanish com¬ munity in the Philippines. Fr. Jose Rodriguez, as already in¬ timated, issued his pamphlet Caingat Cayo, which warned the Filipinos against reading the Noli. In 1889, Rizal published his answer to Fr. Rodrfguez in the pamphlet La Vision de Fr. Rodriguez, a brilliant satire in which Rizal exposed the igno¬ rance of the friar. The result of all his writings was to antagonize the Spaniards, but Rizal* with a single-minded devotion to his country and his people, worked harder for the welfare of the native land. In 1891, he finished his second novel, El Filibus- terismoy published the same year with the help of Valentin Ventura, who lent him the money necessary to print the book. THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 141 Remembering the unjust execution of the three Filipino priests Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, Rizal dedicated his second novel to their memory, saying: The Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by sur¬ rounding your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the belief that there was some error, committed in fatal moments, and the entire Philippines, by worshipping your memory and calling you martyrs, in no sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, the refore, as your complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not have cherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake to combat. And while we await that Spain some day shall restore your good name and shall cease to be a party to your death, let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over your unknown to mbs, and any one who, with out clear proofs, at tacks your memory, stains his hands in your blood! The Fili, in contrast with the Noli, is a political novel in which Rizal predicted the coming of the Revolution. Yet because he was essentially a man of peace, he made that Revolution fail, for he conceived of it only as a peaceful, not an armed, revolu¬ tion"

THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 141 Remembering the unjust execution of the three Filipino priests Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, Rizal dedicated his second novel to their memory, saying: The Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by sur¬ rounding your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the belief that there was some error, committed in fatal moments, and the entire Philippines, by worshipping your memory and calling you martyrs, in no sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, the refore, as your complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not have cherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake to combat. And while we await that Spain some day shall restore your good name and shall cease to be a party to your death, let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over your unknown to mbs, and any one who, with out clear proofs, at tacks your memory, stains his hands in your blood! The Fili, in contrast with the Noli, is a political novel in which Rizal predicted the coming of the Revolution. Yet because he was essentially a man of peace, he made that Revolution fail, for he conceived of it only as a peaceful, not an armed, revolu¬ tion. Thus, he put in the lips of Father Florentino, the kindly Filipino priest, these significant words: I do not mean to say that our liberty will be secured at the sword’s point, for the sword plays but little part in modern affairs, but that we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it, by exalting the in telligence and the dignity of the in dividual, by loving justice, right and greatness, even to the extent of dying for them, - and when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, the tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn. Rizal returned to the Philippines for the second time — the first was in 1887 — early in 1892 and was promptly arrested and thrown into Fort Santiago. On July 7,1892, his banishment to Dapitan was announced of ficially. For four years he remained in Dapitan helping his less for tunate countrymen, teaching the young boys how to be good citizens, planting fruit trees, doing some business on the side, writing letters, collecting shells and sending them to his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt in Austria, 142 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE writing a Tagalog grammar, and beautifying the plaza. His life was, as it had been in Europe, in tense. There was no idle moment. Finally, fed up with his isolation in Dapitan, he asked permission from the governor-general to go to Cuba to enlist as a military doctor. His request was granted, and soon he was on a ship bound for Manila. It was at this critical moment that the revo¬ lution flared up. Rizal, not wanting to be in volved in the revolt, stayed on the ship to await the arrival of the next steamer for Spain. When finally he left for Spain he thought that he was already safe from the arm of Spanish law. But before the ship could dock at Barcelona, he was placed under arrest, in carcerated, and returned to the Philippines. He was tried on charges of treason and complicity in the revolution, charges which were absolutely baseless. He was sentenced to die by musketry and on the early morning of December 30, 1896, he was shot amidst the frenzied shouts of the Spaniards. La Solidaridad.—The last two decades of the nineteenth century were characterized by political activities never before witnessed among the Filipinos. It was an era of growing po¬ litical and social consciousness and discontent which found ex¬ pression in the works of Lopez Jaena, Rizal, del Pilar, Eduardo de Lete, Pedro Govantes and others, who left the Philippines in search of freedom elsewhere. Lopez Jaena and other reformers founded the Filipino Circle in Madrid in 1882 and even published its mouthpiece to bring to the at tention of the peninsular Spaniards the so-called Philippine problem. But the Minister of the Colonies discouraged the Circle and its mouthpiece, with the result that the reformists were for ced to disperse. In 1887, however, Eduardo de Lete and other Filipinos put out the newspaper Espaha en Filipinas which was to voice the desires of the Filipinos. The patriotic Filipinos at home collected funds as advanced sub¬ scription, but before the money could reach the editor, Eduardo de Lete, the newspaper had already passed out of existence. It was at this point that the reformists in Spain thought of publishing an of ficial or gan. On the suggestion of Mariano Ponce it was agreed to continue the publication of the Espaha en Filipinas, but the failure of the paper was taken a reason against reviving it. In 1888, the expatriates in Spain proposed to the reformists at home that a new or gan be founded, a proposal that was accepted by the Manila end of the reform movement. Rizal, chosen to manage the proposed periodical, but then in London busy copy¬ ing and annotating Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, turned down the of fer. With the arrival of Marcelo H. del Pilar in THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 143 Barcelona on New Year’s Day, 1889, the founding of a Filipino or gan gained acceptance from all Filipinos in Spain. It was agreed to finance the first numbers of the periodical by contributions from the Filipino expatriates. On February 15, 1889, the first number of La Solidaridad came out in Barcelona. The paper was a for tnightly dedicated to the exposition of conditions in the Philippines, the defense of the Filipinos against the malicious and slanderous at tacks of the hired writers of the friars, and the publication of studies about the Philippines and the Filipinos. The first editor of the Sol was Lopez Jaena, but he turned over its management to del Pilar in December 1889. The news of the birth of the Sol reached the Philippines within two months and soon the nationalists began sending their contributions to Spain. The periodical came out regularly every fifteen days, thanks to the patriotism of the Filipinos in Spain and those in the Philippines. In writing for the Sol, the Filipino reformists used pen names for obvious reasons. Rizal used Dimas Alang and Laong Laan; Mariano Ponce hid under the pen names Tikbalang, Naning, and Kalipulako; Antonio Luna used Taga-Ilog; Marcelo H. del Pilar Wrote under the pen name Plaridel; and Jose Ma. Panga- niban wrote as Jomapa. The Spaniards in the Philippines naturally for bade the reading of the periodical, but their vigilance was not enough to discourage the Filipinos from smuggling in copies of the for bidden newspaper"

The Sol may not have succeeded in in fluencing the Peninsular Government to grant the reforms demanded by the Filipinos, for it was not disposed, in the first place, to humor them, but in its more than six years of existence the Sol represented the ideals of the Filipino reformist group. At the same time, it also succeeded in exposing the evils in Philip¬ pine society and in belying the claims put forth by such anti- Filipino writers as Wenceslao E. Retana, Vicente Barrantes, and Pablo Feced that the Filipinos had no civilization before the coming of the Spaniards. Thus, when Barrantes claimed that the Filipinos had no the ater, Rizal, writing in the Sol, ridiculed him and exposed not only his prejudice, but also his profound ignorance. The Sol, then, represented in that age the spirit of the Filipinos. Having played its role creditably, the newspaper bowed out of existence in Madrid with its last number dated November 15,1895. The Hispano-Filipino Association.—At first the reformists worked in dividually, but later on, realizing the advantages of 144 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE pooling their resources and efforts in the campaign to have their voices heard by the Peninsular Government, they banded to gether to form a society. The society, conceived as early as July 1888, was in augurated on January 12, 1889 in Madrid. Since it was composed of Filipinos and Spaniards who favored the granting of reforms in the colony the society was called Hispano-Filipino Association. Prominent among the Spanish members of the society were Miguel Morayta, professor of history at the Uni- versidad Central de Madrid, and Felipe de la Corte, author of several works on the Philippines. Morayta was elected president of the society. To make the propaganda work effective, the society was divided into three sections: the political section under Marcelo H. del Pilar; the literary section under Mariano Ponce; and the sports section under Tomas Arejola. The Central Directorate of the association outlined the reforms needed in the Philippines, among the most important of which were (1) the compulsory teaching of Spanish in all schools; (2) the sup¬ pression of in human punishment in all jails and tribunals of justice; (3) the establishment of the civil register and the register of deeds; (4) the abolition of the diezmos prediales and the sanctorum 2; (5) the establishment of secondary schools in two or three provinces of the archipelago; (6) reforms in the University of Santo Tom£s in or der to raise it to the rank of the universities in Spain; (7) the establishment of agricultural banks; (8) the in itiation of reforms in the public administration: and (9) construction of good roads and railways. The concerted campaign of the Hispano-Filipino Association resulted in the passage of laws in the Cortes which would have been of benefit to the Filipinos had they been carried out. It was this society which urged no less than fifty-two Spanish to wns to petition the Cortes to favor parliamentary representation of the Philippines. The petition was presented to the Cortes by Representative Emilio Junoy on February 21, 1895, but nothing came out of it. The society also secured the passage of the Maura Law in 1893; the law for the compulsory teaching of Spanish; and the laws providing for the in itiation of reforms in the judiciary. But these reforms were never carried out in view of the return to power of the reactionary group in Spain. The Role of Masonry.—Disgusted with the role of the friars in Philippine affairs, the Filipino propagandists in Spain affiliated 2 The diezmos prediales was a tax which amounted to one-tenth of the produce of the land; the sanctorum was a tax for the support of the Church. THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 145 with masonic lodges in Spain. Lopez Jaena, not contented with merely becoming a member of a Spanish Masonic lodge, thought of bringing to gether all Filipino Masons into * one lodge. Con¬ sequently, he established the lodge Revolution in Barcelona on April 1, 1889, which was exclusively by and for the Filipinos. A year later lodge La Solidaridad was founded in Madrid. This lodge took in all the members of Revolution when the latter was dissolved. These lodges became the focus of propaganda activities in Spain and were responsible for the maintenance of unity in the ranks. The leading Filipino Masons then thought that it was time to establish lodges in the Philippines. Pedro Serrano Laktaw and Antonio Luna were selected to carry out this decision. Serrano Laktaw, upon his arrival in the Philippines, conferred with patriotic Filipinos regarding the feasibility of secretly establishing Masonic lodges. On January 6, 1891, the lodge Nilad was established and a year later, on March x O, 1892, it was recognized by the Gran Oriente Espahol, the Spanish mother lodge. The Masons were careful in their pronouncements, for they did not want to antagonize unduly the Spanish author¬ ities. In one of their meetings, the Masons set forth their platform as follows:3 We want a dignified, free and prosperous country in whose horizons can be seen the splendor of the sun of justice and civil¬ ization. We want a democratic regime, a genuine and effective autonomy of the human in dividual as against the enslaving pre¬ tensions of an ambition that nourishes its life in the absorption of the rights of the people and that waters its happiness with the tears of the needy. We want a good government and a good adminis¬ tration"

Kalaw, La Masonerta Filipim (Manila, Bureau of Printing, 1920) p. 99. An English translation of this book by Frederick H. Stevens is entitled Philippine Masonry (Manila, 1956). A slightly different transla¬ tion of the passage cited above is found on page 107 of the English tran iation. 146 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Such platform could not but win the sympathy of the en¬ lightened Filipinos. In view of the in creasing number of Masons, it was thought practical to establish other lodges throughout the Philippines. As of May 1893, the Masonic lodges in the country numbered thirty-five, nine of which were in Manila. The popularity of Masonry was such that even women joined it. The first woman to become a Mason was Rosario Villaruel, who was in itiated a member of the lodge Walana on July 18, 1893. The other female members were Trinidad Rizal, Romualda Lanuza, Josefa Rizal. Marina Dizon, Sixta Fajardo, Valeriana Legazpi, and Purificacion Leyva. It can be said that the pro¬ paganda corps was composed mostly of Masons, and it was this fact which worried the Spanish Minister of the Colonies who, on April 4, 1895, sent a cablegram to the governor-general in which he said that “an alarm exists here about the separatist work in Archipelago through Masonic propaganda that excludes all Spaniards and is directed exclusively by natives. I request Your Excellency... to in form me hourly of this, and, if true, to redouble the vigilance and to issue necessary or ders to the [provincial] governors.” At the outbreak of the revolution, Masonry was already deeply entrenched in the Philippines. Though not directly re¬ sponsible for the revolution — Andres Bonifacio, however, was a Mason — it served as a pattern for the methods and or ganization of the radical Katipunan. La Liga Filipina.—Almost simultaneously with the in tro¬ duction of Masonry in the Philippines, a civic society called La Propaganda was established. Its members, composed mostly, if not exclusively, of the middle class, contributed money to defray the expenses of the Filipino reformers in Spain who were waging a campaign to obtain political concessions from the Mother Country. The funds collected were for warded to the Hispano- Filipino Association. In time, however, the funds of the or ganiza¬ tion were malversed, and the society passed out of existence. At this juncture, Rizal stepped into the picture and proposed the founding of another civic society. He had prepared a consti¬ tution for this society while at Hongkong and now he thought that the time had come for concrete action. On the night of July 3, 1892, at a house in Tondo, Rizal founded and in augurated La Liga Filipina. Elected were Ambrosio Salvador, President; Agustin de la Rosa, Fiscal; Bonifacio Arevalo, Treasurer; and THE CAMPAIGN FOR REFORMS 147 Deodato Arellano, Secretary. The aims of the Liga, as expressed in its constitution, were: (1) To unite the whole archipelago into one compact, vigorous, and homogeneous body; (2) Mutual protection in every want and necessity; (3) Defense against all violence and in justice; (4) Encouragement of in struction, agriculture, and commerce; and (5) Study and application of reforms. The aims of the Liga were to be carried out through the creation of a governing body composed of the Supreme Council, the Provincial Council, and the Popular Council. The members were each to pay ten centavos as monthly dues. Each of the members was free to choose a symbolic name for himself. The funds of the society were to be used in the following manner: (1) The member or his son who, while not having means shall show application and great capacity, shall be sustained; (2) The poor shall be supported in his right against any powerful person; (3) The member who shall have suffered any loss shall be aided; (4) Capital shall be loaned to the member who shall need it for an in dustry or agriculture; (5) The in troduction of machines and in dustries, new or necessary in the country, shall be favored; and (6) Shops, stores, and establishments shall be opened, where the members may be accommodated more economically than else¬ where. Innocent as the society was, the Spanish authorities considered it dangerous and on the night of July 6, 1892, Rizal was secretly arrested. The following day, Governor-General Eulogio Despujol or dered Rizal’s deportation to Dapitan. The Liga languished for a while, but some members continued to support it. The aims remained the same, but it was agreed that all should con¬ tribute to ward the support of La Solidaridad in Spain. Domingo Franco was elected President; Deodato Arellano, Secretary- Treasurer; Isidoro Francisco, Fiscal; Juan Zulueta and Timoteo Paez, members of the Supreme Council.

The society 148 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE I lasted only a few months. Its death led to a conflict among its members. The middle-class members of the society believed that something could still be done by La Solidaridad in its campaign for reforms. The poor members led by Andres Boni¬ facio thought that there was no hope of reforms. This conflict led to the for mation of the Cuerpo de Compromisarios by the middle class. Bonifacio, however, had already founded his Kati- punan. The Cuerpo lived but a few months, for its members, though patriotic, were passive and too conservative to make the society and effective medium for propaganda. The Failure of the Reform Movement.—The in tensive cam¬ paign of La Solidaridad for reforms did not yield any tangible result in the form of changes in the administration of the Philip¬ pines. It is true that it brought to the at tention of the peninsular Spaniards the so-called Philippine problem, but the Mother Country was too preoccupied with its own in ternal problems to give a moment’s thought to the colonial problem. Then, too, the friars were to powerful even in Spain to be sidetracked by the Spanish authorities, so that whatever good impressions the Sol had created in the minis of the Spanish of ficials in Spain were counteracted by the in fluential and powerful newspaper of the friars, La Polftica de Espaha en Filipinas. In the second place, the societies established in the Philippines whobe purpose wn to campaign for reforms did not have sufficient mean, with which to carry out their aims. There was difficulty in collecting funds for the continued publication of the Sol. Some of the members of these societies realized the futility of the peaceful propaganda, considering that in its more than six years of existence the Sol had not succeeded in convincing the government cf Spain to grant the needed reforms in the administration of the colony. In the third place, the propagandists were divided against the mselves by petty jealousies. The result was the weakening of the ties that hound them to gether. Most of the members of the middle class were conservative and lacked the courage and the vigorous hope necessary to continue an unequal struggle. Hence the failure of the peaceful campaign for reforms. t JC «T > *1. ^ •T* •j' ^ ^ 9 BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN The failure of the reform movement was already evident as early as 1892 when Rizal was arrested and then banished to Dapitan. Yet the more hopeful among the middle class still hung on to the conviction that they could soften the heart of Mother Spain into granting the reforms demanded. It is for to this reason that the reform movement continued for four more years or until 1896 when the masses, led by Andres Bonifacio, were for ced to take to the field against the Spaniards. Andres Bonifacio, a man of scanty education but nevertheless highly in telligent, founded the Katipunan on the very night that the news of Rizal’s deportation to Dapitan leaked out. Unlike the members of the middle class, Bonifacio and his plebeian asso¬ ciates did not dream of mere reforms. They were in terested in liberating the country from the tyranny of the Spaniards and the only way, to their minds, to accomplish their end was to prepare the people for an armed conflict. Thus the Katipunan was founded on a radical platform, namely, to secure the in¬ dependence and freedom of the Philippines by force of arms. The Founding of the Katipunan.—The news of Rizal’s de¬ portation shocked and surprised the people, for Rizal to them was the symbol of freedom. That night of July 7, 1892, Andres Bonifacio, Valentin Diaz, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, Deodato Arellano, and a few others, met secretly at a house on Azcarraga (now Claro M. Recto Avenue), near Elcano Street, Tondo, and decided to form an association called Kataastaasan Kagalang- galang na Katipunan nang manga Anak nang Bay an, or Kati¬ punan for short. The men gathered around a flickering table lamp, performed the ancient blood compact, and signed their membership papers with their own blood. It was agreed to win more members to the society by means of the triangle method in which an or iginal member would take in two new members who did not know each other but knew only the or iginal member 149 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 4 50 who took them in. Thus, or iginal member A, for in stance, would take in new members B and C. Both B and C knew A, but B and C did not know each other. Also agreed upon during the meeting was the payment of an entrance fee of one real fuerte (twenty- five centavos) and a monthly due of a medio real (about twelve centavos.) The Katipunan Objectives.-TJnder the leadership of Boni¬ facio, the Katipunan laid down three fundamental objectives or aims: political, moral, and civic. The political objective con¬ sisted in working for the separation of the Philippines from Spain. The moral objective revolved around the teaching of good manners, hygiene, good morals, and at tacking obscurant¬ ism, religious fanaticism, and weakness of character. The civic aim revolved around the principle of self-help and the defense of the poor and the oppressed. All members were urged to come to the aid of the sick comrades and their families, and in case of death the society itself was to pay for the funeral expenses. For purposes of economy, however, the society saw to it that the funeral was of the simplest kind, avoiding unnecessary expenses so common under the rule of the friars. The Structure of the Katipunan.—A study of the procedure and structure of the Katipunan reveals that it was in fluenced by Masonry, in sofar as in itiation rites were concerned, and by Rizal’s La Liga Filipina as to or ganization. This is not surprising, for Bonifacio was a member of the Liga and was also a Mason, being affiliated with the lodge Taliba. Structurally, the society had three governing bodies: the Kataastaasang Sanggunian or the Supreme Council, the Sangguniang Bayan or Provincial Council, and the Sangguniang Balangay or Popular Council"

The Kataas¬ taasang Sanggunian was the highest governing body of the society and was composed of a president, a fiscal, a secretary, a treasurer, and a comptroller or in terventor. The Sangguniang Bayan and the Sangguniang Balangay represented, respectively, the province and the municipality or town. Each of these had a council similar to that of the Supreme Council. The latter, to gether with the presidents of the two other councils, constituted the Katipunan Assembly. Judicial matters affecting the members of the society were referred to a sort of court known as the Sangguniang Hukuman or Judicial Council. It sat as a court of justice to pass judgment on any member who violated the rules of the society or to mediate BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 151 between quarreling brethren or factions. During its existence, the Judicial Council had not passed the death sentence on any member. But a Secret Chamber, composed of Bonifacio, Jacinto, and Valenzuela, sentenced some members to be expelled for having allegedly violated the secrets of the society. The triangle method of taking in members was so slow and clumsy that in October 1892 Bonifacio convened the or iginal members and decided to change the method of recruiting members. It was agreed that any member of the society could take in as many new members as he could get. Under this new method the membership of the society reached more than 100. Thereupon an election was held, with the following as of ficers of the first Supreme Council: Deodato Arellano. President or Supremo Andres Bonifacio. Interventor or Comptroller Ladislao Diwa. Fiscal Teodoro Plata. Secretary Valentin Diaz. Treasurer In a meeting in February 1893, Bonifacio, disgusted over Arellano’s in action, deposed him and put Roman Basa in his place as Supremo. The of ficers of this second Supreme Council were: President or Supremo Fiscal Secretary Treasurer Councilors When, early in 1895, Bonifacio realized that Roman Basa was an in effectual as Deodato Arellano, he called a meeting of the society and promptly deposed Basa.

Secretary bf Finance Immediately before the outbreak of the revolution, the refore, Bonifacio or ganized the Katipunan into a government revolving around a “cabinet” composed of men of his confidence. Kinds of Membership.—When the Katipunan had sufficiently expanded to in clude more than a hundred new members in its ranks, Bonifacio thought it convenient to divide the members into three grades: the first, the second, and the third. The first grade was called Katipon and wore a black hood in the meetings of the society. The hood had a triangle of white ribbon in side of which were the letters Z. LI. B. y the Katipunan characters corres¬ ponding to the Roman A. ng B. y meaning Anak ng Bay an (Son of the People) —^the password of the Katipon. The second grade, called Kawal (Soldier), wore a green hood with a triangle consist¬ ing of white lines. At the three angles of the triangle were the letters Z. LI. B. Suspended from the neck of the Kawal was a green ribbon with a medal at the end, with the letter K in the ancient Tagalog script (t R) appearing in the middle of the medal. Beneath the letter K was a crossed sword and flag. The password BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 153 was Gom-Bur-Za> taken from the names of the three martyrs Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora. The third grade, called Bayani (Patriot), wore a red mask and sash with green borders, symbol¬ izing courage and hope. The front of the mask had white borders that for med a triangle with three Kys arranged as if occupying the angles of a triangle within a triangle. At the latter’s base were the letters Z. LI. B. in a horizontal row, thus: K. K. K. Z. LI. B. The password was Rizal. For the members to recognize each other in the street, the society adopted countersigns: a member meeting another member placed the palm of his right hand on the breast, and as he passed the other member he closed his hand, bringing the in dex finger and the thumb to gether. The Katipon could graduate to the Kawal class if he had brought several members into the society, while the Kawal could become a Bayani upon being elected an of ficer of the society. •: • ' _ ' x The Katipunan Codes.—The Katipunan members faced many dangers, so that precautions had to be taken to keep the society secret.

Upon his request, Benita Rodriguez, with the help of Gregoria de Jesus, Bonifacio’s wife, made a flag. It consisted of a red rectangular piece of cloth with three white K's arranged horizontally at the center. This was the first of ficial flag of the society. But some members of the Katipunan had their flag with the three K's arranged in the form of a triangle. Bonifacio himself had a personal flag which consisted of a red rectangular piece of cloth at the center of which was a white sun with an in definite number of rays. Below the sun were the three white K's arranged horizontally. Owing to the lack of uniformity in the design and use of the flag, some generals of the revolution adopted their own BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 157 designs. Thus, General Mariano Llanera used a black banner with a skull above two cross-bones and the letter K, all in white. So different was this banner that Bonifacio humorously called it “Llanera’s Skull” Still another flag was that of General Pio del Pilar which consisted of an equilateral triangle with a K at each angle. Inside the triangle was a mountain with the sun rising behind it. When the revolution flared up, the Magdalo faction of the Katipunan in Cavite adopted a flag consisting of a red rectangular banner with a white K in the ancient Tagalog script in the center of a sun, represented by a white circle, with an in definite number of rays. Later on, the rays of the sun were limited to eight to represent the eight provinces which first took up arms against the Spaniards. This flag became the first of ficial banner of the revolutionary for ces and was blessed in a mass celebrated at Imus. In the Naik Assembly of March 17, 1897, the Katipunan military leaders decided to adopt a flag with a new design. It consisted of a red rectangular cloth with a white sun and rays in the middle. The sun was the mythologic 1 sun with eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth. This flag superseded the flag of the Magdalo faction and became the first of ficial flag of the Filipinos. It became the symbol of the Filipino nationality until the signing of the Truce of Biyak-na-bato on December 14-15, 1897, when it was hauled down from the po^e of the revolutionary headquarters at Biyak-na-bato. Celebrations ““The nationalistic temper of the society was shown in its annual celebrations. February 17 of every year was recalled as the day of prayer in memory of the three Fili¬ pino priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora. On that date, all po¬ pular councils were in structed to erect a catafalque, shrouded in black, with a to rch at each of the four comers. The catafalque was adorned with wreaths made of the makabuhay plant, the symbol of immortality. The members entered in single file and prayed for the souls of the departed martyrs and swore to avenge their death. Andres Bonifacio.—Bonifacio, the founder and or ganizer of the Katipunan, was born in Tondo, then a part of the Province of Manila, on November 30, 1863. His parents were Santiago Bonifacio and Catalina de Castro. Andres grew up in the slums and never knew the benefits of a prosperous life. He had three brothers and two sisters: Ciriaco, Procopio, Espiridiona, Troadio, 158 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and Maxima. Andres studied the alphabet in a school conducted by a certain Guillermo Osmena of Cebu. The death of his parents for ced Andres to give up schooling to shoulder the burden of his family.

Late in his teens, he was employed as a clerk- messenger in the commercial firm of Fleming and Company. Serious-minded, honest, and dedicated to his work, he later on became the Company’s agent. He sold rattan, tar, and other articles of trade. His earnings, however, were not enough to make both ends meet, and so he transferred to Fressell and Company as an agent. His constant struggle to make a living did not give him much leisure to improve his mind. Nevertheless, he read books by the lamplight at home. He read Rizal’s two novels, The Ruins of Palmyra, Hugo’s Les Miserables, Eugene Sue’s The Wandering Jew, the lives of the Presidents of the United States, International Law, the Penal and Civil Codes, some novels, and a book on the French Revolution. Thus, while not for tunate to have a for mal education he educated himself by dint of hard work. In his early manhood, Andres fell in love with a certain Monica, whom he later married. The marriage was short-lived, for Monica died of leprosy. In 1892, he met Gregoria de Jesus of Kalookan and fell in love with her. After months of court¬ ship, the two were married, with Restituto Javier and his wife, Benita Rodrfguez, as sponsors. After their Catholic marriage at Binondo Church, the couple were re-married according to the Katipunan rites. After the rites, Gregoria was in itiated into the Women’s Chapter of the Katipunan and chose Lakangbini (Muse) as her symbolic name. Henceforth, she took custody of the papers, revolvers, seals, and other paraphernalia of the society. Humble and self-effacing, Bonifacio knew his limitations and recognized the worth of others. When, after writing a sort of decalogue for the Katipunan, he found out that Emilio Ja¬ cinto’s Kartilla was better, he did not hesitate to set his own aside and adopt that of Jacinto as the of ficial “teachings” of the society. Though the founder and or ganizer of the Kati¬ punan, he did not in sist on becoming its president. It was only after discovering that the first two presidents were not as serious BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 159 in their duties as expected of them that he took over the reins of the Katipunan government. To him the question of the society’s survival was a matter of life and death, for he knew that the success of any society depended on its president and the cooperation of its of ficers and members. In 1895, Bonifacio, to gether with Emilio Jacinto, Restituto Javier, Guillermo Masangkay, Aurelio Tolentino, Faustino Ma- nalak, Pedro Zabala, and a few others, went to the in terior part of Morong (Now Rizal) to find a place to hide in case of the discovery of the society. They reached San Mateo and Mon- talban and found the caves of Makarok and Pamitinan safe places of refuge. Initiation rites were held in the two caves, for many poor Filipinos joined the small group in or der to be¬ come “Sons of the People”. The Katipuneros, old and new, went in side a cave and there, charcoal in hand, Bonifacio wrote on the walls: “Long live Philippine in dependence!” Returning to Manila, Bonifacio plunged into a vigorous campaign to pro¬ pagate the ideals of the society. He deposed Roman Basa as president and had himself elected to take his place. Rumors of the leakage of the Katipunan secrets were broadcast, and Boni¬ facio, who had a one-track mind, had the rumors in vestigated and those suspected of having a hand in the leakage were sum¬ marily expelled from the society. Such was Bonifacio’s person¬ ality that no one dared to question the wisdom o is decisions. But he was not dictatorial; he was, in fact, humble and to lerant. But when the society’s existence was at stake, he never hesi¬ tated to take drastic action against anybody whom he thought would defeat the purposes for which the Katipunan was founded. Bonifacio may have been ignorant from the point of view of the middle class, but he succeeded where the middle class failed. The middle class, in their naivete, held on to their mis¬ taken belief that Spain would hear their cries for reforms. Boni¬ facio, though not highly educated, had more in sight than his in tellectual superiors. It was this in sight which led him to found the revolutionary Katipunan for he knew deep in his heart that Spain would never grant the reforms demanded by the reformists. His in sight told him that only an armed conflict could make the Spaniards realize the folly of their bull-headedness. Bonifacio, then, was the legitimate Father of the Revolution, and with out him it is extremely doubtful whether the Philippine Revolution could have become a reality at a time when everybody seemed in despair with out doing anything about it. Yet, in the present 160 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE estimation he is overshadowed by Rizal as the national hero. The reason for this is that when the Americans came they found in Rizal’s philosophy of education of the masses first before in dependence a fitting rationalization of their colonial policy, namely, that of “benevolent assimilation”, and so they encouraged and promoted the Rizal cult. On the other hand, they found in Bonifacio, a common man, a dangerous precedent, for Bonifacio stood for the use of armed might in at taining in dependence and freedom. For the Americans, the refore, to promote the Boni¬ facio cult was to defeat their own purpose of discouraging the Filipinos from taking up arms against them. It is only in the Philippines were the leader of the liberation for ces is not the national hero. This is not to disparage Rizal, who was a great Filipino and who deserves all the honors that his memory now enjoys"

The point is that Bonifacio should be placed <Tde by side with Rizal in so far as the national estimation is concerned. Emilio Jacinto.—Called the “Brains of the Xatipunan”, Emilio Jacinto was born in Tondo on December 15, 1875, the son of Mariano Jacinto and Josefa Dizon. As a boy he spent most of the day in the streets and so came to learn a kind of Spanish which may be described as bamboo or pidgin Spanish. Being poor did not detain his parents from sending him to school to pursue a career. He enrolled at San Juan de Letran College and later at the University of Santo Tomas, where he developed a taste for reading. At the ago of eighteen, he joined the Kati- punan, becoming the youngest member of them all. Membership in the secret society for ced Jacinto to speak Tagalog, for it was a rule that all conversations and discussions were to be carried on in Tagalog. By a painful process, Jacinto became an expert in Tagalog and wrote most of his articles in this language. Honest and highly in telligent, he won the admiration of Bonifacio and subsequently became his trusted friend and adviser. Bonifacio had uch implicit faith in him that when the latter wrote the Kartilla or primer for the Katipuneros Bonifacio did not hesistate to adopt it as the of ficial “teachings” of the society. Bonifacio and Jacinto were like brothers who never separated from each other if either one could help it. Separation came late in December 1896 when Bonifacio went to Cavite to mediate between the two rival factions of the Katipunan in that province ana Jacinto, appointed commander-in-chief of the revolutionary for ces in Laguna, went to this province to direct the movements of the revolutionists. Nevertheless, they communicated with I BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 161 each other when time and circumstances permitted. Bonifacio died two years earlier than Jacinto who, while directing a campaign against the Spaniards in Mahayhay, Laguna, contracted fever and died on April 16,1899. Jacinto, as the “Brains of the Katipunan”, was the author of articles which in fluenced the masses to join the society and to make sacrifices for the welfare of the native land. He was the editor of the society’s newspaper Kalayaan (Freedom) which voiced the aspirations of the people. The secret of Jacinto’s success as a propaganda writer lies in the simplicity of his style, a style that reflected his personality. Precisely because of the simplicity of his style, the masses understood him and felt the power of his words. Aside from the Kartilla, Jacinto wrote Liwanag at Dilim (Light and Darkness), Pahayag (Manifesto), Sa mga Kababayan (To My Countrymen), Ang Kasalanan ni Cam (Cain’s Sin), Pag- katatag ng P&mahalaan sa Hukuman ng Silangan (Establishment of the Provincial Government of Laguna), and Samahan ng Bay an sa Pangangalakal (Commercial Association of the People). The Teachings of the Katipunan.—Realizing the importance of a primer to in doctrinate the members of the society in its ideals, Jacinto prepared one which he called Kartilla, a word adopted from the Spanish cartilla which at the time meant a primer for grade school students. The Kartilla consisted of thirteen “teachings” which the members of the society were expected to follow. The primer follows: I. Life which is not consecrated to a lofty and sacred cause is like a tree with out a shadow, if not a poisonous weed. II. A good deed that springs from a desire for personal profit and not from a desire to do good is not kindness. III. True greatness consists in being charitable, in loving one’s fellow-men and in adjusting every movement, deed and word to true Reason. IV. All men are equal, be the color of their skin black or white. One may be superior to another in knowledge, wealth and beauty, but cannot be superior in being. V. He who is noble prefers honor to personal gains; he who is mean prefers personal profit to honor. VI. To a man with a sense of shame, his word is in violate. 162 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE VII. Don’t fritter away time; lost riches. may be recovered, but time lost will, never come again. VIII. Defend the oppressed and fight the oppressor. IX. An in telligent man is he who is cautious in speech and knows how to keep the secrets that must be guarded. X. In the thorny path of life, man is the guide of his wife and children; if he who guides moves to ward evil, they who are guided likewise move to ward evil. XI. Think not of woman as a thing merely to while away time with, but as a helper and partner in the hardships of life. Respect her in her weakness, and remember the mother who brought you into this world and who cared for you in your childhood. XII. What you do not want done to your wife, daughter and sister, do not do to the wife, daughter and sister of another. XIII. The nobility of a man does not consist in being a king, nor in the highness of the nose and the whiteness of the skin, nor in being a priest representing God, nor in the exalted position on this earth, but pure and truly noble is he who, though born in the woods, is possessed of an upright cha¬ racter; who is true to his words; who has dignity and honor; who does not oppress and does not help those who oppress; who knows how to look after and love the land of his birth. When these doctrines spread and the Sun of beloved liberty shines with brilliant effulgence on these unhappy isles and sheds its soft rays upon the united people and brothers in everlasting happiness, the lives, labors, and sufferings of those who are gone shall be more than re¬ compensed.

Bonifacio, in his Katungkulang Gagawin ng mga Z. LI. B. (The Duties of the Sons of the People), laid down the rules to be followed strictly by all members of the society. The rules constitute a decalogue: I. Love God with all your heart. II. Bear always in mind that the love of God is also the love of Country, and this, too, is love of one’s fellow-men. III. Engrave in your heart that the true measure of honor and happiness is to die for the freedom of your country. IV. All your good wishes will be crowned with success if you BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 163 have serenity, constancy, reason, and faith in your acts and endeavor. V. Guard the mandates and aims of the K. K. K. as you guard your honor. VI. It is the duty of all to deliver, nt the risk of their own lives and wealth, anyone who runs great risks in the performance of his duty. VII. Our responsibility to ourselves and the performance of our duties will be the example set for our fellow-men to follow. VIII. Insofar as it is within your power, share your means with the poor and the unfortunate. IX. Diligence in the work that gives sustenance to you is the true basis of love — love for your own self, for your wife and children, and for your brothers and countrymen. X. Punish any scoundrel and traitor and praise all good work. Believe, likewise, that the aims of the K. K. K. are God-given for the will of the people is also the will of God. The Women’s Chapter of the Katipunan.—Bonifacio’s idea of expanding the membership of the Katipunan led him, first to do away with the triangle method of recruiting new members and, second, to the for mation of the Women’s Chapter. Doubt¬ less, Bonifacio knew that the strength of a society with pur¬ poses such as those of the Katipunan lay in numbers. Conse¬ quently, in the middle of 1893, soon after his second marriage, he opened the door of the society to patriotic and scrupulous women who had the virtue to keep their to ngues in place. To be sure that no woman of dubious character could penetrate the deep secrets of the society, Bonifacio limited the member¬ ship to the wives, daughters, and sisters of the male members. It was their duty to take in new members, male or female, and, more important from the point of view of security, to see to it that the meetings of the male members were not disturbed by surprise raids of the authorities. Thus, while the men were hold¬ ing their meeting in the backroom, the women, in or der to draw away the suspicion of the authorities, danced and sang in the sala in full view of the passersby. It was thus that the women members acted as a front for the clandestine goings-on of the Katipuneros. Prominent women of the community were in itiated into the society. Their of ficers were: Josefa Rizal, President; Gregoria de Jesus, Vice-President; Marina Dizon, Secretary; and Angelica 164 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Rizal Lopez, Fiscal. In particular, Gregoria de Jesus risked her life in keeping in her person many Katipunan documents even at a time when she was heavy with child. The Katipunan Newspaper.—Another step taken by the Ka¬ tipunan to propagate its teachings and to win more adherents to its side was the establishment of a printing press. One dif¬ ficulty encountered was the lack of sufficient funds with which to purchase even a small printing press adequate enough to meet the simple needs of the society. Fortunately, however, two Katipuneros from the Visayas, Candida Iban and Francisco del Castillo, who came back from Australia in 1895, had one thousand pesos between them for having won in the lottery. With a magnificent gesture, the two bought the small printing press of Bazar El Cisne, then located at the comer of what are now Carriedo and Rizal Avenue. Its owner, Antonio Salazar, agreed to part with his press for four hundred pesos. The press was transferred to Andres Bonifacio’s house on what is now Oroquieta Street near Zurbaran. With a proud conscience, Iban and del Castillo returned to Kalibo, Kapis, to spread the doctrines of the Katipunan. The printing press lacked many types, particularly the letter a, the much-employed letter in Tagalog. Jacinto, who was much in terested in the press, borrowed twenty pesos from his mother and with it he bought some types from Isabelo de los Reyes, a great Filipino nationalist. But even with these types the facilities of the press were in adequate, for other types were lacking and with out them no printing job could be done. The problem was solved by four Katipuneros employed at the printing establish¬ ment of the popular daily Diario de Manila. They stole types from the printing plant of this Spanish-owned periodical and gave them to Dr. Pio Valenzuela. On the latter’s suggestion, the printing press was moved to his place of residence — at No. 35 (until recently No. 408) Lavezares Street, San Nicolas, a place found convenient for the printing of the proposed or gan of the society. To manage the press, Valenzuela asked the help of Ulpiano Fernandez, a printer in the printing plant of the daily El Comercio, and Faustino Duque, a student of San Juan de Letran. Valenzuela suggested the name Kalayaan for the society’s or gan, and Jacinto and Bonifacio approved it. However, it was agreed that Jacinto be made its editor but that the name of BONIFACIO AND THE KATIPUNAN 165 Marcelo H. del Pilar be made a front as the editor. It was also agreed that to fool the Spanish authorities as to the place of printing, Yokohama should be placed on the masthead. For weeks, day and night, Valenzuela, Duque, and Fernandez took turns at preparing the pages of the Kalayaan, which was ap¬ proximately nine by twelve in ches in size"

For weeks, day and night, Valenzuela, Duque, and Fernandez took turns at preparing the pages of the Kalayaan, which was ap¬ proximately nine by twelve in ches in size. Two thousand copies of the first number, dated January 18, 1896, were printed the hard way. The paper actually came out in mid-March. The first number contained a supposed editorial of del Pilar which, in fact, Jacinto wrote. It greeted the people and wished them “solidarity and in dependence” and of fered them his “life and all he had for the good of the Filipino people.” There was an article by Jacinto, Valenzuela’s Catuiran? (Is it Right?) which described the cruelties of the Spanish priest and civil guards of San Francisco del Monte (now in Quezon City) on a helpless village lieutenant, Jacinto’s Manifesto which urged the Filipinos to revolt against the Spaniards to secure their liberty, Bonifacio’s poem Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Bayan (Love of Country), and a sprinkling of news. For obvious reasons, Jacinto Valenzuela, and Bonifacio wrote under their pen names: Dimas-Ilaw, for Jacinto; Agap-ito Bagumbayan, for Bonifacio; and Madlang- Away> for Valenzuela. Copies of the first number were secretly distributed in Ma¬ nila, Cavite, Morong (now Rizal province), Kalookan, Malabon, and other places. Encouraged by the success of this in itial number, Jacinto began to prepare a second number which would contain nothing but his works. But time was running out on the Kalayaan. When the type was already set and the paper about ready to “go to bed,” that is, about to be printed, the Spanish authorities, who had suspected the periodical to be in or around Manila, raided the place where the paper was being printed, which was then at No. 6 (until recently No. 712) Clavel Street, San Nicolas. But before the authorities could lay hold of the press, Duque and Fernandez had already destroyed it. Then the two separated, never to meet again. The second number, there¬ fore, did not come out. The Expansion of the Katipunan.—The publication and dis¬ tribution of the Kalayaan, with its in cendiary contents, imme¬ diately in fluenced the thinking and feeling of the masses in Central Luzon. Jacinto’s and Bonifacio’s writings, in particular, awakened the people from a long lethargy and immediately swelled the ranks of the Katipunan. At the end of March 1896, when the 166 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE two thousand copies of the periodical had been distributed far and wide, hundreds of people nightly joined the Katipunan in the to wns of San Juan del Monte, San Felipe Neri, Pasig, Pateros, Mariquina, Kalookan, Malabon, and other places. The people became aware of their rights and duties to their country. The Katipunan also extended to the provinces of Bulakan, Batangas, Cavite, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Laguna. Bonifacio’s single- minded devotion to the Katipunan and to all that it stood for finally yielded results. From the founding of the society to January 1, 1896, it did not have more than 300 members, but since the appearance of the Kalayaan the membership had in¬ creased to around 30,000. The Kalayaan had done its bit for the society. The people were now prepared to shoulder the risks demanded of them in the struggle for the emancipation of the native land. ^ ^ 10 THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE The Katipunan became especially popular in the suburbs of Manila and in the provinces of Central Luzon. But as the number of its affiliates in creased, the Spanish authorities began to suspect its underground character. The friars began to denounce the nightly meeting held by the Katipuneros and on August 19,1896, Patino exposed the society to Fr. Mariano Gil. With the discoveiy of the Katipunan, Bonifacio had no other alternative than to take to the field and on August 23, at Pugadlawin, he and his men declared their in tention to fight to the bitter end. The revolution spread to other provinces. In Cavite, meanwhile, the two factions of the society were at loggerheads and Bonifacio was in vited to mediate between them. At Tejeros, it was agreed to change the society with a government responsive to the demands of thp times, and in the election that followed Bonifacio was chosen Director of the Interior. Unfortunately, his election was questioned by Daniel Tirona. Bonifacio, hurt by the in sult, declared the results of the election null and void. In April, he was or dered arrested, tried, and executed. The Filipinos were at the time losing battle after battle. Aguinaldo retreated to Biyak-na-bato, where the Republic was founded. Later, in De¬ cember, the Truce of Biyak-na-bato was concluded between the rebels and the Spanish Government. The Truce, however, was a failure. Rizal and the Revolution.—Bonifacio, who had known Rizal during the Liga\\ days but whom Rizal did not know personally, wanted Rizal’s opinion on the necessity of rising in arms against the Spaniards. He, the refore, commissioned Dr. Pfo Valenzuela to go to Dapitan in June 1896 to confer with Rizal. With Valen¬ zuela on the S. S. Venus were Rizal’s sister Narcisa and his niece Angelica Rizal Lopez. The ship cast anchor at the port of Dapitan in the late afternoon of June 21. Valenzuela immediately pro¬ ceeded to Rizal’s home. In the evening after supper, Valenzuela whispered to Rizal the real purpose of his visit. He then related the founding of the Katipunan and its aims, among which was 167 168 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE to overthrow Spanish authority.

Told that the revolution might break out prematurely because of the impatience of the masses, Rizal pointed out that a revolution with out sufficient arms should not be started against an armed nation. He remembered the first Cuban revolution against Spain which failed because of lack of arms. Even so, he suggested that in fluential and wealthy Filipinos be at tracted to the cause of the society in or der to ensure the success of the revolution. In such a case, he said, there would be unity among all classes of Filipinos. Knowing that the society had no competent military leadership, he suggested that Antonio Luna be appointed to direct all military operations against the enemy. Valenzuela pointed out the difficulty of winning over the wealthy Filipinos to the Katipunan side. This was one problem to which Rizal failed to suggest a solution. It is obvious that Rizal was not against revolution in itself, but was against it only in the absence of preparation and arms on the part of the rebels. This was because Rizal feared that with out arms the rebels would surely be defeated and the reby cause irreparable damage to the in nocent people. His knowledge of the history of revolutions in other lands led him to believe that any revolution was useless unless the rebels were at least as armed as the enemy. After the in terview, Valenzuela sailed back to Manila and reported the results of his mission to Bonifacio. The latter, having been apprised of Rizal’s opinions, admitted that it would be fatal for them to start a revolution with out enough arms with which to fight the enemy. Preparations for the Struggle.*—Meanwhile, the Katipunan began preparations geared for any emergency. Bonifacio thought that sooner or later the revolution would explode, and he did not want to be taken by surprise. Consequently, he or dered the manufacture of bolos to be distributed to the members of the society. Bolos alone, however, would *not do, for the enemy was armed with Remingtons and Mausers. A ray of hope shone on the Katipuneros when Valenzuela told Bonifacio that the Japanese warship Kongo, with Admiral Kanimura on board, had dropped anchor at Manila Bay and that it might be possible for them to seek the aid of the admiral in the struggle for na¬ tion al liberation. Contacts were made through Jose Moritaro Tagawa, a Japanese employee of a Japanese bazaar, and soon the Katipunan committee headed by Bonifacio himself had an in terview with Admiral Kanimura. The in terview was cordial, but the Japanese refused to commit his country to the revolu- THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 169 tion ary plans of the society. With the failure to enlist the help of Japan, Bonifacio look¬ ed elsewhere for concrete help, but found that the best help was self-help. He thought of the Katipuneros in the various branches of the government and sought to use them as his to ols. He called two of them, Tito Miguel and Roman Ramos, who were employed in the Maestranza (arsenal), and or dered them to steal rifles and pistols, for the Maestranza was a place where the or dinance was located. Through this expediency the weapons of the Katipunan in creased. Even so, the quantity of such weapons was not sufficient to start a revolution. More bolos were or dered and hidden to prevent the authorities from dis¬ covering the in tentions of the society. Spanish Suspicion Aroused.—-The in crease in the number of the Katipunan affiliates, while advantageous to Bonifacio, was in a way a disadvantage. The new members were impatient and in their impatience they met nightly, a circumstance that aroused the suspicion of the authorities. Rumors or such nocturnal meetings reached Manila, and the Spanish population, particularly the friars, became jittery. From Batangas, a rumor circulated that there were secret gatherings and that rifles and ammunition from Hongkong and Yokohama were being landed. The friars exploited this rumor to advantage by telling the governor-general to act at once in or der to prevent a bloody up¬ rising. Blanco, the governor-general, was reluctant to act upon the suggestion of the friars, for he was not exactly sympathetic to the friars. Nevertheless, he banished all the prominent men of Malolos, Bulacan, in 1895, and those of Taal, Batangas in 1896. The friar campaign of vilification now began. On June 20,1896, a Recollect friar in Cavite denounced the alleged existence of a group of men who met at banquets to to ast the victory of the Cuban rebels against the Spaniards. Another rumor had it that there were some 17,000 rebels in the town of San Juan del Monte, San Felipe Neri, San Pedro Makati, Pasig, and Caimito. The parish priest of Guadalupe, listening to a rumor-monger that was his servant, denounced the existence of an alleged secret society in his parish to the governor-general. The curate of Santa Cruz, Manila, reported to the authorities alleged secret meetings of suspicious persons in Manila. In spite of these reports, most of which were exaggerated and calculated to force the governor-general to act precipitately, 170 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the latter refused to take any action. Instead, he rebuked the friars and told Father Mariano Gil’s messenger: “Undeceive yourself, freemasonry and filibustering are like a pit in which you put your finger and at once you to uch the bottom. Both evils exist only in the minds of the friars and a few other fanatical Spaniards.” The friars, undaunted by their rebuff, continued to pester the governor-general with more reports of alleged secret meetings. To them, the governor-general was a fathead who could not make up his mind.

But Echaluce was not in a mood to humor the friar. Instead, he took precautions to make Manila safe from disturbances of any kind. At almost the same time, however, an unfortunate in cident took place between two Katipuneros who were working in the Spanish-owned Diario de Manila. Apolonio de la Cruz and Teo- doro Patino had a misunderstanding and Patino, weakling that he was, took his revenge on Apolonio by revealing the secrets of the society to his sister, Honoria. The latter, an in mate at the or phanage in Mandaluyong, was reported to have cried. The madre portera,, Sor Teresa, when in for med of the cause of the girl’s alleged grief, suggested that Teodoro Patino tell all he knew to Father Mariano Gil. In the afternoon of August 19, Patino told Father Mariano of whajt he knew about the secret society. The friar immediately hurried to the printing shop of the Diario de Manila and, accompanied by the owner of the periodical, searched the premises for the hidden proofs of the existence of the Katipunan. The lithographic stone used to print the Katipunan receipts was found and when it was shown to Patino the latter pronounced it genuine. At midnight, the locker of Policarpio Turla, whose signature appeared in the re¬ ceipts, was for ced open and there a dagger, the rules of the society, and other pertinent documents were found. These proofs were turned over to the police, who were now convinced of the existence of a vast underground society whose purpose was the overthrow Spanish sovereignty in the Philippines. % The discovery of the Katipunan was immediately followed by mass arrests of Filipino suspects. Prominent men, numbering about 500, were rounded up and convicted of illegal association and treason. Others, though in nocent, were thrown into jail THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 171 and Fort Santiago. That night, Manila hardly slept, for the Fili¬ pinos did not know when they would be arrested and to rtured with out even a semblance of reason. Wealthy Filipinos Implicated.—As Valenzuela feared, the wealthy Filipinos refused to join the Katipunan. Bonifacio thought that in or der to force them to sympathize with the members of the society a trick should be played on them in such a way as to make it appear that they were deeply in volved in the Katipunan. Jacinto then drew up a list of wealthy Filipinos, while some of the Katipuneros were or dered to study their signatures for the purpose of for ging them on some documents they were about to prepare. This done, fake letters with the for ged signatures of the wealthy victims were made. The alleged documents contained the in for mation that such wealthy men as Luis R. Yangco, Frincisco L. Roxas, and others, were heavy contributors to the Katipunan fund and that they were in sym¬ pathy with the principles and plans of the society. The result of this trick was unexpected: in stead of for cing the wealthy Filipinos to join or contribute to the society they denounced it and denied any knowledge of its existence. But their excuses were of no avail, for the authorities simply refused to believe them. Francisco L. Roxas was executed, while Yangco and others were saved by bribing some highly-placed Spanish of ficials. The “Cry” of Pugadlawin.—The news of the discovery of the Katipunan spread throughout Manila and the suburbs. Bo¬ nifacio, in for med of the discovery, secretly in st me ted his run¬ ners to summon all the leaders of the society to a general as¬ sembly to be held on August 24. They were to meet at Balin¬ tawak to discuss the steps to be taken to meet the crisis. That same night of August 19, Bonifacio, accompanied by his brother Procopio, Emilio Jacinto, Teodoro Plata, and Aguedo del Ro¬ sario, slipped through the cordon of Spanish sentries and reached Balintawak before midnight. Pfo Valenzuela followed them the next day. On the 21 st Bonifacio changed the Katipunan code because the Spanish authorities had already deciphered it. In the afternoon of the same day, the rebels, numbering about 500, left Balintawak for Kangkong, where Apolonio Samson, a Katipunero, gave them food and shelter. In the afternoon of August 22, they proceeded to Pugadlawin. The following day, in the yard of Juan A. Ramos, the son of Melchora Aquino who was later called the “Mother of the Katipunan”, Bonifacio ask¬ ed his men whether they were prepared to fight to the bitter 172 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE end. Despite the objection of his brother-in-law, Teodoro Plata, all assembled agreed to fight to the last. “That being the case,” Bonifacio said, “bring out your cedulas and tear them to pieces to symbolize our determination to take up arms!” The men obediently tore up their cedulas, shouting: “Long live the Phil¬ ippines!” This event marked the so-called “Cry of Balintawak,” which actually happened in Pugadlawin. First Skirmishes.—In the midst of this dramatic scene, some Katipuneros who had just arrived from Manila and Kalookan shouted: “Dong Andres! The civil guards are almost behind us and will reconnoiter the mountains.” Bonifacio at once or dered his men to get ready for the expected at tack of the Spaniards. Since they had in ferior arms the rebels decided, in stead, to retreat.

Soon after, a burst of fire came from the approaching Spaniards. The rebels deployed and prepared for the enemy. In the skirmish that followed, the rebels lost two men and the enemy one. Because of their in ferior weapons, which consisted mostly of bolos and a few guns, the rebels decided to retreat. On the other hand, the Spaniards, finding the mselves greatly outnumbered, also decided to retreat. So both camps retreated and thus prevented a bloody encounter. This was the first skirmish fought in the struggle for national emancipation. i On August 26, Spanish reinforcements were dispatched to Pasong Tam 6 to drive away the rebels. ‘But the latter, who were going to or were already in Balara, could not be found. The Spaniards, frustrated in their at tempt to contact the Filipino contingent, shot, in stead, two in nocent farmers who were leisurely going on their way home. Returning to Manila, the Spanish soldiers boasted that a great fight had taken place at Pasong Tamo and that they had driven the rebels to the in terior. This was the or igin of the so-called “Cry of Balintawak”, which neither happened on August 26 nor in Balintawak. Meanwhile, the rebels, skirting the mountain trails day and THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 173 night, finally arrived at Mariquina. Later in the day, however, they abandoned it and proceeded to Hagdang Bato on August 27. The following day, Bonifacio issued a manifesto in citing the people to take up the Filipino cause and to get set for a concerted at tack on the Spaniards on August 29. The manifesto read: This manifesto is for all of you. It is absolutely necessary for us to stop at the earliest possible time the nameless oppressions being perpetrated on the sons of the people who are now suffering the brutal punishment and to rtures in jails, and because of this please let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose it is necessary for all to wns to rise simultaneously and at tack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulation we have put in force. The in tended at tack on Manila did not materialize, how¬ ever, probably because there were not sufficient arms with which to carry out the plan. Instead, Bonifacio and Jacinto led their men in an at tack on the powder magazine at San Juan del Monte on August 30. The defending Spaniards, outnumbered and weak, fought a delaying battle until reinforcements could arrive. With the arrival of fresh Spanish troops, Bonifacio and his men lost the battle and were driven back with heavy casualties. The Revolution Spreads.—Meanwhile, south of Manila the rebels grew in strength. A thousand men marched to ward Pasig and at tacked the small force of civil guards. At almost the same time, about 400 rebels at tacked the church of Pandakan and captured it with out any resistance, for the parish priest ran to the belfry to save his life. Pateros, Tagig, Kalookan, Kawit, San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), Noveleta, San Pedro Makati, and other to wns, rose as one man and pursued the Spanish enemy. Bonifacio and his men shifted the rebel at tack to San Mateo, Mariquina, and Montalban, which they captured but which were later re-captured by the Spaniards. With the defeat of the Filipinos in the battle of Langka River, near San Mateo, Bonifacio or dered them to retreat to Balara. The Spaniards pursued them and in the battle that followed Bonifacio nearly lost his life when a Spanish bullet ripped the collar of his shirt while he was protecting his friend Jacinto. 174 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE In the north, the rebels of San Isidro, armed with bolos and pointed sticks, at tacked the Spanish garrison on September 2, 3, and 4. Led by Mariano Llanera and accompanied by musi- kong bumbong (band with bamboo in struments), the rebels at¬ tacked furiously but were repulsed by the heroic defense of the Spaniards. The Reign of Terror.-The flames that now engulfed many provinces worried the Spanish authorities no end. To frighten the population into submission, the authorities resorted to a reign of terror. Only by this means could they hope to prevent the revolutionary movement from becoming national in scope. The Spanish volunteers and Corps of Vigilantes promptly in¬ vaded the homes of Filipinos in or der to secure evidence against those who were directly or in directly in volved in the uprising. In Trozo, Captain Carlos March of the Spanish Volunteers found in criminating evidence against Katipuneros. All suspects were immediately arrested and thrown into jail.

Torture was employed to make them squeal, with the result that those who could not stand the various to rtures in flicted on them shouted the names of some Katipunan members. Hundreds were arrested and jailed. Suspects in the provinces were brought to Manila to receive what the Spaniards considered their “just punishments”. Heads of families, hundreds of them, were shipped to the Carolines or to the Spanish penal colony in Africa. These men could congratulate the mselves for not having been beheaded. Fort Santiago was so packed with Filipino suspects that many of them died of suffocation. To extract money from the wealthy Filipinos, some Spanish authorities extorted money from their victims who, after having paid a THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 175 sum, were re-arrested and jailed until they paid more. In some places, as in Malinta, Pulo, Bulakan, the Spaniards massacred the people. Tortures were resorted to by the Spaniards in or der to make the ignorant masses talk. One form of to rture was to hang the suspect by the hands and then have him suddenly dropped to the ground. Another method was the use of an electric machine whose wires were connected to the feet or hands of the suspect. The poor man was electrocuted time and again to force him to shout the names of even in nocent persons. Another form of to rture was to hang a suspect by the hand, his feet barely to uching the ground. More of ten, the suspects were simply shot with out any trial. On September 4, four Kati- puneros were executed at the Luneta. On September 12, thirteen men from Cavite were executed. They have since been known as “Los Trece Martires de Cavite” The following month, the Spaniards executed an unknown number of Filipinos in Mindanao. On January 4, 1897, twelve Bicolano rebels were executed, thus making them the “Twelve Bicol Martyrs”. In Kalibo, Kapis, nineteen patriots were shot to death. But the most in famous in justice was perpetrated upon Jos£ ^izal, who was executed at the old Bagumbayan Field on December 30, 1896. These executions, however, only served to make the Filipinos more bitter and to fight with fiercer determination. The Katipunan in Cavite.—Even before the outbreak of the revolution, the Katipunan in Cavite was already divided into two factions representing two provincial councils. The factions were known as the Magdalo and the Magdiwang. The for mer was led by Baldomero Aguinaldo, with headquarters at Cavite el Viejo (now Kawit), and the latter by Mariano Alvarez, with headquarters at Noveleta. The Katipuneros of Cavite were very active, having raised the standard of revolt on August 31, 1896 when they at tacked the tribunal (municipal building) of San Francisco de Malabon. The Magdiwang, on the other hand, at tacked the Spaniards in Noveleta, shouting: “Panahon na! Mabuhay ang Kalayaan/” (The time has come! Long live Lib¬ erty!) At Cavite el Viejo, the Magdalo, led by Candido Tirona, took the of fensive against the enemy garrison which was cap¬ tured with out much difficulty. Meanwhile, Emilio Aguinaldo marched against Bakood to in tercept the Spanish for ces coming from Manila but was defeated. Aguinaldo retreated to Imus and here, in the morning of September 5, he defeated the Spanish troops under the command of General Aguirre. The latter, in his haste to escape the Filipinos, galloped furiously away, leaving 176 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE his sword behind him. In this encounter, the Spaniards lost hundreds of men and sixty guns with ammunition. Aguinaldo returned to Imus the recognized hero of the hour. From that time on, the Cavitenos called him General Miong, not Capitan Miong. The rebel triumphs fired the imagination of the people. Every male, young or old, carried a bolo or a knife, ready to fight the hated Spaniard wherever he was met. Aguinaldo was so in spired by the showing of the people and by the unity in all the ranks that he issued two manifestoes on October 31 calling upon the people to continue to fight until liberty was won. Defeated in many sectors, the Spaniards decided to carry the fight to the province of Cavite. Governor-General Ramon Blanco, egged on by the friars and the Spanish populace, took the of fensive in Cavite early in November. He assaulted Bina- kayan and Noveleta, but was repulsed with heavy losses. The Filipinos, under Aguinaldo, also suffered losses, one of the casualties being Candido Tirona, Aguinaldo’s bosom friend. Having defeated the Spaniards, Aguinaldo and his men created the positions of Secretary of State and Secretary of the Interior. Jacinto Lumbreras was designated Secretary of State, while Daniel Tirona was appointed Secretary of the Interior. The successive defeats of the Spaniards led the friars to agitate against Governor-General Blanco. They accused him of dilly¬ dallying and of in competence. Their efforts were rewarded when General Blanco was finally relieved as governor by the brutal General Camilo de Polavieja on December 13, 1896. Po- lavieja began his campaigns in Cavite early in January 1897 and partially succeeded in driving away the rebels from several places. His or der to massacre the civilians led Andres Bonifacio, then in Morong, to issue a proclamation denouncing the Spanish brutality. Inch by inch, the Spaniards captured the territory they had lost until about one-third of Cavite fell into their hands.

Bonifacio in Cavite.—The rivalry that existed between the Magdalo and the Magdiwang factions of the Katipunan in Ca¬ vite led to a series of reverses early in January 1897. In a mass movement such as that of the revolution, unity was in dispensable. To patch up matters, the Magdiwang faction in vited Andres Bonifacio to in tervene in the conflict. At first Bonifacio refused, saying that his presence in Morong was necessary. But upon the in sistent request of Artemio Ricarte and Mariano Alvarez, THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 177 Bonifacio accepted the in vitation. Accompanied by his wife and his brothers Procopio and Ciriaco, Bonifacio went to Cavite to ward the end of December 1896. He was met at Zapote by Emilio Aguinaldo, Edilberto Evangelista, and a few other leaders, who wanted to meet him personally. On December 31, an assembly of revolutionists was held at Imus to determine whether the Katipunan should be superseded by another form of government. The Magdalo faction believed that with the out¬ break of the revolution the Katipunan had ceased to be a secret society and should, the refore, be superseded by one more in keeping with the demands of the period. The Magdiwang men, on the other hand, contended that the Katipunan should remain the government of the revolutionists because it already had a constitution *nd by-laws recognized by all. The conflict was not resolved and the meeting ended with out having accomplished anything. The Tejeros Convention.-As months passed by and as the rebels found the mselves on the receiving end of the armed power with the Spaniards, their leaders thought it timely and wise to call another meeting of both factions in or der to solve their in ternal problem. Consequently, on March 22, 1897, the two factions again met at Tejeros, a barrio of San Francisco de Malabon. The conventic i was held at the estate-house of the friars which the rebels had captured earlier. The session opened at about two o’clock in the afternoon with Jacinto Lumbreras a Magdiwang, as presiding of ficer, and Teodoro Gonzales, also a Magdiwang, as secretary. Severino de las Alas, a Magdiwang, took the floor and suggested that the convention assembled should solve the problem of whether a new government should be established to take the place of the Ka¬ tipunan. This suggestion led to one heated argument after an¬ other until both camps almost came to blows, numbreras sensed the seriousness of the situation and immediately called for a recess to cool off the hotheads. After an hour, the session was resumed with Bonifacio as chairman. To resolve the issue, he prudently acceded to the wish of some that a new government be established to replace the Katipunan. However, he stated, the principle that the will of the majority should be respected and obeyed must be followed. The convention adopted this principle unanimously. With this thorny question resolved, the Republic of the 178 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Philippines was proclaimed. Before the election, Bonifacio re¬ minded the convention that whoever should get elected to any position should be respected. This proposal was approved and the election got underway. Elected were: Emilio Aguinaldo Mariano Trias. Artemio Ricarte. Emiliano Riego de Dios Andres Bonifacio President Vice-President Captain-General Director of War Director of the Interior When Bonifacio was being proclaimed, Daniel Tirona, a Magdal 6 y stood up and said: “The position of Director of the Interior is an exalted one and it is not proper that a person with¬ out a lawyer’s diploma should occupy it. We have in our pro¬ vince a lawyer, Jos£ del Rosario!” Bonifacio was hurt and felt that he was in sulted, for it had been previously agreed that who¬ ever got elected was to be respected. He demanded, the refore, that Daniel Tirona retract what he said. But Tirona, in stead of apologizing to Bonifacio, disappeared from the scene. Boni¬ facio in his anger whipped his pistol and was about to fire at Tirona when Ricarte held his arm, thus preventing what might have been a tragic affair. The people began to leave the hall, and Bonifacio, still angry, cried aloud: “1, as chairman of this assembly, and as President of the Supreme Council of the Kati- punan, as all of you do not deny, declare this assembly dissolved, and I annul all that has been approved and resolved.” With this statement, he left the hall, followed by his men. The Second Meeting at Tejeros.—Aguinaldo, who was at Pasong Santol, a barrio of Dasmarinas, was notified the fol¬ lowing day of his election to the Presidency. At first he re¬ fused to leave his men who were preparing to fight the enemy, but his elder brother, Crfspulo Aguinaldo, persuaded him to take the oath of of fice, promising that he would take his place and would not allow the enemy to overrun the place with out dying in its defense. Aguinaldo then acceded to his brother’s request and proceeded to Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza), where he and the others elected the previous day, with the ex¬ ception of Bonifacio, took their oath of of fice. Meanwhile, Bonifacio and his men, numbering forty-five, again met at the estate-house of Tejeros on March 23. All of them felt bad about the results of the previous day’s proceed¬ ings, for they believed that anomalies were committed during THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 179 the balloting.

But Bonifacio refused to return to the revolutionary fold headed by Aguinaldo. The Naik Military Agreement.—Bonifacio’s anger over what he considered an irregular election and the in sult heaped on him by Daniel Tirona, a Magdalo, rankled for long. At Naik, he and his men drew up another document in which they resolved to establish a government in dependent of, and separate from, that established at Tejeros. An army was to be or ganized “by persuasion or force” and a military commander of their own choice was to take command of it. The document read: We who sign these presents with our true names, all of ficers of the army who have met in convention headed by the Supreme Chief [Bonifacio], on account of the critical situation of the pueblos and the war, having discovered the treason committed by certain of ficers who have been sowing discord and conniving with the Spaniards, our enemies, corrupting the army and being guilty of criminal neglect in the care of the wounded, have agreed to deliver the people from this grave danger by the means hereinafter enu¬ merated: First: All combatants shall, by persuasion or force, be in cor¬ porated in an army corps and placed under the command of General Pio del Pilar. Second: We shall recognize no one as being vested with full power except Right in the first place, and those courageous of ficers who, since the beginning of the war and until the present moment, have never gone back on their oath and have conducted the mselves loyally. r Third: Any disloyal person shall be punished on the spot, according to his desserts. Such is our agreement, and we swear before God and the country of our birth that we shall keep it unto the grave. 180 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Among the forty-one men who signed it were Bonifacio, Artemio Ricarte, Pfo del Pilar, and Severino de las Alas. The document posed a potential danger to the cause of the Revolu¬ tion, for it meant a definite split in the ranks of the revolutionists and almost certain defeat in the face of a united and well-armed enemy. The Trial and Execution of Bonifacio.—From Naik, Boni¬ facio, his wife, and two brothers, with a handful of loyal fol¬ lowers, transferred to the barrio of Limbon, Indang. The Naik Military Agreement came to the knowledge of Aguinaldo and, realizing the significance of Bonifacio's in tentions, he or dered the arrest of the Bonifacio brothers. A group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Agapito Bonzon was dispatched to Lim¬ bon to effect the arrest. Bonzon or dered his men to surround the perimeter of the zone of which Bonifacio’s house was the center. A skirmish was in evitable, and in the firing that fol¬ lowed Bonifacio was stabbed in the larynx, his brother Ciriaco was killed, and his other brother Procopio was wounded. Boni¬ facio was placed in a hammock and brought to Naik, the capital of* the rebel government. On April 28, Aguinaldo for warded the Bonifacio case to the Council of War in Order “to conduct the necessary trial... On April 29, personnel of the Council of War was completed, with Colonel Pedro Lipana as the Judge Advocate. Jose Elisas was fiscal, while Placido Martinez and Teodoro Gonzales were appointed defense at to rneys of Andres and Procopio, respectively. The trial lasted from April 29 to May 4. The Council of War that tried the Bonifacio brothers was composed of General Mariano Noriel, President, and Cri- sostomo Riel, General Tomas Mascardo, Placido Martinez (Bo¬ nifacio’s at to rney), Mariano Riego de Dios, Esteban Ynfante, and Sulficio Antony, members. Andres and Procopio Bonifacio were found guilty of treason and sedition in spite of the fact that the evidence was not suf¬ ficient to prove their alleged guilt. Bonifacio was returned to jail pending the reading of the sentence. On May 8, Baldomero Aguinaldo, the Auditor of War, wrote President Aguinaldo re¬ commending approval of the Council of War’s decision, namely, execution of the two brothers. On the same day, May 8, President Aguinaldo commuted the death sentence to banishment. As soon as this or der changing the death sentence to banishment reached the headquarters of Generals Mariano Noriel and Pio del Pilar, they immediately rushed to General Aguinaldo and THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 18 I asked him to with draw his or der. They reasoned that with Boni¬ facio alive the cause of the Revolution would be prejudiced since he would continue to disrupt the unity of the revolutionary for ces.

The Revolution Continues - When Makapagal returned U Maragondon, where the new rebel capital had been established following the capture of Naik by the enemy, he found the Fili¬ pino for ces retreating and the Spaniards pounding the town furiously. The enemy, however, suffered much, for the Spanish soldiers, most of whom had just arrived from Spain, were not accustomed to the tropical climate. General Camilo de Pola vieja, tired of the endless battles, asked for his relief as governor- general. His request was granted and on April 15, 1897, he sailed for Spain. He was replaced by a for mer governor-general of the Philippines, Fernando Primo de Rivera. Primo de Rivera arrived in Manila on April 23. He im¬ mediately conferred with the military commanders regarding the general situation in the Philippines. He found out to his dismay that far from being demoralized the Filipinos were united against the Spaniards. At the end of the month, he marched to Cavite to take personal charge of the military operations. First he issued a decree granting pardon to those who, up to May 17, would give up their arms and surrender to the government. Most Filipinos ignored this decree. Forthwith, Primo de Rivera launched a spirited campaign against the rebels, for cing Aguinaldo and his men to retreat to Batangas. 182 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE With almost all of Cavite in the hands of the Spaniards, Primo de Rivera issued another decree extending the benefit of his pardon beyond May 17. His purpose was to win over the Fili¬ pinos to his policy of at traction. A few took advantage of the governor’s decree, while the rest continued their resistance against the enemy. Aguinaldo, meanwhile, was in Talisay, Batangas, where he had established his headquarters. The enemy surrounded the area in the hope of capturing him, but he slipped through the Spanish cordon on June 10 and proceeded with his men to the hilly region of Morong (Rizal). With 500 picked men, he crossed, the Pasig to Malapad-na-bat 5, near Guadalupe, and from here he secretly passed through San Juan del Monte and Montalban, and on to Mount Puray. After a well-earned rest, Aguinaldo and his men proceeded to Biyak-na-bato, San Miguel del Mayumo, in Bulakan, where he established his headquarters. The Government of Central Luzon.—News of Aguinaldo’s arrival at Biyak-na-bat 6 reached the to wns of Central Luzon. As a consequence, armed men from Pangasinan, Zambales, the Ilocos provinces, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija, renewed their armed resistance against the enemy. From Biyak-na-bat S, Aguinaldo and his men joined for ces with those of General Mariano Llanera of Nueva Ecija and harassed the Spanish soldiers garrisoned in the Central Luzon provinces. With the coming of the rainy season, Primo de Rivera’s campaigns were temporarily halted. Meanwhile, at Puray, the rebels met in the camp of General Licerio Geronimo. Those assembled established the Depart¬ ment al Government of Central Luzon, comprising Manila, Morong, Bulakan, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Tarlac, and Pangasinan. The assembly elected the following: ^ Father Pedro Dandan Anastacio Francisco Paciano Rizal. Cipriano Pacheco... Teodoro Gonzales... Feliciano Jocson... President Vice-President Secretary of the Treasury Secretary of the War Secretary of the Interior Secretary of Welfare The assembly also designated the field commanders with their corresponding military rank. t The Biyak-na-bato Republic—Unable to persuade the Fili¬ pinos to give up their arms, Primo de Rivera issued a decree orf July 2, 1897, which prohibited all in habitants to leave their THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 183 villages and to wns. The effect of the decree was contrary to the governor’s expectations, for the people continued fighting for the Filipino cause. From his hideout, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation in July entitled “To the Brave Sons of the Philip¬ pines” in which he listed the revolutionary demands, namely: (1) the expulsion of the friars and the return to the Filipinos of the lands they appropriated for the mselves; (2) represenation in the Spanish Cortes; (3) freedom of the press and to lerance of all religious sects; (4) equal treatment and pay for Peninsular and Insular civil servants; (5) abolition of the power of the government to banish citizens; and (6) legal equality for all persons. This proclamation shows that Aguinaldo was still willing to return to the Spanish fold provided these demands were met. This in spite of the fact that before July he and his men had already established a republican government at Biyak-na-bat 6, known as the Biyak-na-bat 6 Republic. The provisional consti¬ tution of this Republic was prepared by Felix Ferrer and Isa- belo Artacho, who copied, almost word for word, the Cuban constitution of Jimaguayu. The Biyak-na-bato Constitution was signed on November 1,1897.

Antonio Montenegro... Isabelo Artacho. Emiliano Riego de Dios Baldomero Aguinaldo. Vice-President Secretary of Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Interior Secretary of War Secretary of the Treasury The Truce of Biyak-na-bat&—•Sometime in August, a mestizo, Pedro A. Paterno, who had spent a part of his life in Spain, ap¬ proached Governor-General Primo de Rivera and asked that he be made a mediator between the Filipinos and the Spaniards. He wanted, he said, to stop the fatal conflict between the two peo¬ ples, for he loved Spain and the Philippines. The governor-general acceded to his request. From August to December, Paterno negotiated with Aguinaldo and Primo de Rivera on the conditions that he thought would be satisfactory to both. On November 18, the first document of what came to be known as the Truce of Biyak-na-bato was signed by Paterno as representative of the revolutionists, and by Primo de Rivera for the Spanish Govern¬ ment. Other matters were threshed out by Paterno, and on December 14 the second document known as the “Programme” was signed by Pvu, erno and Primo de Rivera. The following day, December 15, the third and last document of the Truce was signed, also by Paterno and Primo de Rivera. The resulting Truce provided, among other things: (1) that Aguinalch and his companions would go into voluntary exile abroad; (2) that Primo de Rivera would pay the sum of P 800,000 to the rebels in three in stallments: (a) P 400,000 to Aguinaldo upon his departure from Biyak- na-bato, (b) P 200, Q 00 when the arms surrendered by the revolutionists exceeded 700, and (c) the remaining P 200,000 when the Te Deum was sung and general amnesty proclaimed by the governor; (3) that Primo de Rivera would pay the additional sum of P 900,000 to the families of the non-combatant Filipinos who suffered during the armed conflict. To make sure that the Spanish authorities were sincere, the revolutionists demanded that two Spanish generals were to remain at Biyak-na-bato as hostages and another, Colonel Miguel Primo de Rivera, the governor’s nephew, to accompany the exiles to Hong¬ kong. Primo de Rivera agreed, and on December 23 the Spanish generals, Celestino Tejeiro and Ricardo Monet, arrived at Biyak-na- THE REVOLUTION: FIRST PHASE 185 bato and became hostages of the rebels. On the same day, Agui- naldo and his men, in cluding Pedro and Maximo Patemo, boarded a launch and sailed for Kalumpit. They took the train for Dagu- pan, then the carromatas for the port of Sual Pangasinan. The group sailed for Hongkong the same day, December 27, with Aguinaldo in possession of a check for P 400,000. The Failure of the Truce.—January 1898 was a month of colorful festivities in Manila. The Spaniards, happy that their lives had been spared during the hectic battles, began a series of fiestas so lavish that thousands of pesos were spent to make the occasion, that is, the end of the hostilities, a memorable one. There were boat and horse races, fireworks in the evenings, a magnificent ball at the Ayuntamiento or City Hall, and dramas at the Zorilla Theater. On January 23, the Te Deum was sung at the Manila Cathedral and on the 24 th (Madrid time) at the Palacio Real in Madrid. Meanwhile, the Filipino generals left at Biyak-na-bato did everything in their power to surrender the arms given up by the rebels. Some of the Filipino leaders, however, were suspicious of Spanish aims and continued to hold on to their weapons. They expected a continuation of the armed conflict and prepared the mselves and their men for the emergency. The Spanish au¬ thorities, on the other hand, did not trust the Filipinos. The result was that periodic clashes occurred between the Filipinos and the Spaniards. The clashes started in mid-February and continued until Spanish power was destroyed by the combined Filipino-American for ces a few months later. One of the leaders, General Francisco Makabulos of Tarlac, established the Central Executive Committee which was in tended to be a provisional one “until a general government of the Re¬ public in these islands shall again be established.” This rebel government had a constitution, popularly called the constitution of Makabulos, which provided for an executive committee com¬ posed of a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary of the Interior, a Secretary of War, and a Secretary of the Treasury. It is clear that the Filipino leaders were not disposed to follow the letter of the Truce, but on the contrary felt that they could use the money given to them by Primo de Rivera to purchase arms and ammunition. On the other hand, the lower Spanish of ficials arrested and imprisoned many Filipinos whom they suspected of having been in volved in the rebellion.

Only the in terest of the amount was with drawn and used for the expenses of the exiles. M. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo, with two companions, went to Singapore where the American Consul E. Spencer Pratt conferred with him. Pratt persuaded Aguinaldo to cooperate with Commodore George Dewey who was about to sail to Manila to destroy the Spanish navy. War was declared between the United States and Spain, and Dewey promptly sank the Spanish warships. Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on board an American ship and soon after raised the standard of revolt against Spain. The Filipinos who had surrendered or who had joined the Spanish army as volunteers immediately deserted to the Aguinaldo Camp. Governor-General Basilio Augustin made desperate at tempts to win over the Filipinos to the Spanish side, but it was too late. Fighting on practically all fronts was renewed. The Relief on Primo de Rivera.—Whatever good in tentions Primo de Rivera had with regard to the solution of the Philip¬ pine problem were frustrated when the Conservative Party of Spain was succeeded by one to which the governor-general did not belong. The succeeding Liberal Party sent General Basilio Augustin to the Philippines as Primo de Rivera’s successor. This was unfortunate, for the new governor-general was ignorant of the actual conditions in the Philippines. Primo de Rivera wanted to remain for sometime because rumors were afloat that the serious Spanish-American relations might degenerate into a shooting war. In such an eventuality, it was not wise to send a new governor-general to the Philippines. On April 9, 1898, however, General Augustin arrived in Manila, and the following day Primo de Rivera turned over the reins of the Phil¬ ippine government to his successor. Immediately upon his assumption of of fice, the new governor announced that he would continue Primo de Rivera’s work of pacification. With this announcement, he leaned back and waited for developments. 187 188 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE American Designs on the Philippines - Meanwhile, the Spanish- American relations were turning for the worse. The Cuban revo¬ lution had drawn the United States to the side of the Cuban rebels, for American economic in terests in the island were paramount. At that time, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., one of the in fluential Americans, wi bed that war between Spain and the United States should break out in or der to expand the navy. This statement was made to his sister as early as May 1896. When he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897, he conceived the idea of at tacking Manila in the event that war should break out between the United States and Spain. To his militarist mir i there was only one man who could carry out the plan. It was Commodore George Dewey. Taking ad¬ vantage of the retirement of the commander of the American Asiatic Squadron, Roosevelt worked for the appointment of Commodore Dewey, to the position. On February 25, 1898, Roosevelt cabled Dewey, now commander of the Squadron, to make Hongkong his base of operations. At the same time, he in structed Dewey to take of fensive action against the Spanish flotilla based in Manila in case of a war with Spain. Thus, when the war finally broke out, Dewey was in a position to rush immediately to Manila to destroy the Spanish warships. The coming of the Americans, the refore, was not a mere accident of the Spanish-American War, but a planned action. Roosevelt himself made this clear when he confessed in 1899: “It has been said that it was a mere accident that Dewey happened to be in command of the Asiatic Squadron when the war broke out. This is not the fact. He was sent to command it in the fall of 1897 because... it was deemed wise to have there a man who could go to Manila if necessary.” The Spanish-American War.—In the face of the Philippine and Cuban revolutions, Spain could not antagonize the United States. She the refore tried to heal the rift in or der not to draw her into a fatal war with a rising powerful nation. Unfortunately, however, Spain’s Ambassador to the United States, Dupuy de Lome, wrote a friend in Havana, Cuba, in January 1898, stating that President William Mc Kinley was a weakling and a low politician. This letter was stolen and published in a New York periodical. The result of its publication was that the Americans, who had been roused to anger by stories of alleged Spanish brutalities and mistreatment of American citizens in Cuba, demanded war against Spain. The relief of the Spanish Ambassa¬ dor did not lessen the anger of the American public. THE REVOLUTION: SECOND PHASE 189 This unfortunate in cident was still fresh in the American mind when a tragic event led to the declaration of war against Spain. On February 15, 1898, the American warship Maine was blown up at Havana harbor, resulting in the death of 246 men. Roosevelt, seeing in his accident an excise to goad his government to war, said: “I would give anything if President Mc Kinley would or der the fleet to Havana harbor to morrow. The Maine was sunk by an act of treachery on the part of the Spaniards.” At a little past noon, April 25, Dewey received a cable from Secretary of the Navy Long, saying: “War has commenced be¬ tween the United States and Spain. Proceed particularly against the Spanish fleet. You must capture vessels or destroy. Use utmost endeavor.” Secretary Long’s cable to Dewey was off¬ shoot of the Teller Resolution which the American Congress passed on April 21, 1898, declaring a state of war with Spain. Congress passed a for mal declaration of war on April 25"

Congress passed a for mal declaration of war on April 25. The Battle of Manila Bay.—With the receipt of Secretary Long’s cable announcing the declaration of war with Spain, De¬ wey sailed from Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, for the Philippines with seven heavily armed ships. In the early morning hours of May 1, 1898, his fleet entered Manila Bay almost undetected by the Spanish shore batteries on Corregidor and Bataan. Dewey sailed straight to ward the Manila Bay shore in the hope that he would find Admiral Patricio Montojo’s fleet there and give battle immediately. The Spanish fleet, meanwhile, was near Sangley Point, Cavite, waiting for the best opportunity to go into the fray. In the dawn’s light Dewey saw the outlines of the Spanish ships far to his back and immediately or dered his men to turn back in the direction of Sangley Point. On the bridge of his flagship Olympia, Dewey calmly estimated the distance between the two fleets and when he thought that his guns could hit the enemy ships effectively, he turned to the captain of the Olympia and said calmly: “You may fire when you are ready, Gridley.” The naval battle that followed was one-sided; in fact it was a massacre. While it is true that the Spanish ships outnumbered those of the Americans, the for mer were, nevertheless, poorly armed. All in all, the American fleet had more to nnage than the Spanish flotilla. At 12:30 P. M., the destruction of Montojo’s fleet was complete. The Spaniards, in the face of absolute defeat, hoisted the white flag in Cavite in to ken of surrender. 190 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE News of the victory of Dewey in Manila Bay electrified the Americans. Almost everywhere in the United States the rust¬ ling of the pages of geography books could be heard, for they were ignorant of the location of the Philippines. With that single event, the United States found herself enmeshed in the coils of world politics and signalized her entrance into the “Days of Empire”. Aguinaldo in Singapore.—As early as the middle of April 1898, rumor filtered through Manila and the provinces that the Spanish-American war was a matter of days or perhaps a few weeks away. Many of the rebel leaders stopped their revolu¬ tion ary activities pending the determination of the truth of the rumor. Meanwhile, in Hongkong, Aguinaldo and his compa¬ nions were following the trend of events on the other side of the Pacific. To them it was an opportunity to oust the Span¬ iards from the Philippines. But there was a division in the ranks of the exiles, for Isabelo Artacho wanted the P 400,000 given to Aguinaldo to be divided among them. Aguinaldo refused and Artacho sued Aguinaldo in the Hongkong Supreme Court. To avoid appearing in court, Aguinaldo, accompanied by Gregorio del Pilar and J. Leyba, secretly left for Saigon where he took another ship to Singapore. In the afternoon of his arrival, April 23, Howard Bray, an Englishman of long residence in the Philip¬ pines, contacted Aguinaldo and told him that the American consul, E. Spencer Pratt, wanted to have an in terview with him. In the course of the in terview, Pratt persuaded Aguinaldo to cast his lot with the Americans, adding: “You need not have any worry about America. The American Congress and President have just made a solemn declaration disclaiming any desire to possess Cuba and promising to leave the country to the Cubans after having driven away the Spaniards and pacified the country. Cuba is at our door, while the Philippines is 10,000 miles away!” Aguinaldo expressed his eagerness to return to the Philippines to lead once more the Filipinos in the fight against the Spaniards. Pratt cabled Dewey, who was then in Hongkong, regarding Aguinaldo. Dewey answered: “Tell Aguinaldo come as soon as possible.” Pratt arranged for Aguinaldo’s departure, and on April 26, Aguinaldo and his two companions sailed for Hong¬ kong. Unfortunately, however, Dewey had already sailed for Manila Bay when Aguinaldo arrived. Aguinaldo and Consul Wildman.- Aguinaldo was naturally disappointed upon finding that Dewey had already sailed for THE REVOLUTION: SECOND PHASE 191 Manila. Nevertheless, the American consul at Hongkong, Rounse- ville Wildman, promptly met him and in for med him that Dewey had left in structions for him to make arrangements for the return of Aguinaldo to the Philippines. In the succeeding conferences with Aguinaldo, Wildman suggested that upon his return to the Philippines Aguinaldo should establish a dictatorial govern- ment which was necessary in the prosecution of the war against Spain. However, Wildman said, after the war and after the peace had been restored, Aguinaldo should establish a government similar to that of the United States. Preparatory to his return to the Philippines, Aguinaldo asked Wildman to purchase arms and ammunition for the Filipinos. He gave Wildman P 50,000 for 2,000 rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammunition. Before his departure, he gave Wildman P 67,000 for another shipment of arms. With uncommon energy, Wild¬ man took charge of the purchase of the needed arms and ammunition. The first arms shipment was consummated, but the second shipment, for which Aguinaldo gave him P 67,000, was never realized. Nor did Wildman return or account for the huge sum entrusted to him by Aguinaldo.

Aguinaldo and the Hongkong Junta.—In the wake of De¬ wey’s victory, the Filipinos who composed the Hongkong Junta met on May 4 to discuss the steps to be taken in the face of the new developments. Present during the deliberations were Felipe Agoncillo, temporary President; Doroteo Lopez, tempo¬ rary Secretary; Teodoro Sandico, Anastacio Francisco, Mariano Llanera, Miguel Malvar, Andres Garchitorena, Severo Buena¬ ventura, Maximo Kabigting, Faustino Lichauco, and Antonio Montenegro. Agoncillo in for med the Committee of the arrival of Aguinaldo and suggested the temporary suspension of the meeting to give Aguinaldo and Galicano Apacible time to enter the session hall. Once in side, Aguinaldo related his dealings with Pratt and Wildman. Since the situation in the Philippines was critical, Aguinaldo asked the members of the Junta to ad¬ vise him on what to do. After an exchange of opinions, the Junta unanimously decided that Aguinaldo should return to the Philippines to lead the Filipinos against the Spaniards. Aguinaldo Returns-Aguinaldo was convinced of the wis¬ dom of the Junta's decision and so he prepared for his return to the Philippines. On May 7, the revenue cutter Mc Culloch arrived in Hongkong, but the master of the ship notified Agui¬ naldo that Dewey did not in struct him to take Aguinaldo aboard. 192 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE On the revenue cutter’s second return to Hongkong, however, Aguinaldo was notified that Dewey had given in structions to the captain to have Aguinaldo return on board the Mc Culloch. Consul Wildman made the arrangements for Aguinaldo’s pass¬ age and suggested that he and his companions board the ship at night in or der to avoid the suspicion of the Spanish consul at Hongkong. The Mc Culloch left Hongkong at eleven in the morning of May 17 and arrived at Cavite on May 19. Soon after, Dewey’s launch took him to the Olympia where he was given honors due a general. Aguinaldo alleged that in his conference with Dewey aboard the latter’s flagship, he was told that the United States needed no colonies and that there was no doubt that the United States would recognize Philippine in dependence. Dewey, however, denied he made much a statement to Aguinaldo and asserted that he treated with the Filipino general in a personal manner with out committing the government of the United States. There is no sufficient evidence to back up Aguinaldo’s contention. It is more probable that he mistook the personal at tentions of the Admiral as those of the American government. Renewal of the Struggle.—As soon as Aguinaldo had landed the war materials he had brought from Hongkong, rebels from Bataan came to see him. Aguinaldo handed them copies of his proclamations urging the people to rally once more to the Fili¬ pino flag in the struggle against the Spaniards. The news of his return spread throughout Central Luzon. A number of Filipino volunteers in the Spanish army defected to the Filipino for ces. Aguinaldo or dered them to occupy Da- lahikan, the Cavite shipyard, to prevent the enemy from occupy¬ ing it. Arms were secured from the captain of ■ the American warship Petrel and distributed among the large number of Fili¬ pinos coming in to of fer their loyalty and services to Aguinaldo. On May 21, assured that his people would not desert him, Agui¬ naldo issued a proclamation, saying: Everything appears favorable for at taining in dependence. * * * * * * I urge that we strive to unite our efforts, and let us fire our hearts with the idea of vindicating our country. Many nations are on our side. On the last day of the present month, at noon, we shall be able to rise all at once, and in case our enemies are aware of it, start doing so openly. When you hear that we are bombarding any of the to wns of Salinas [Rosario], Noveleta, Naic, Tansa, Cauit, Bacoor, Las Pina*, and Paranaque, you may begin to move THE REVOLUTION: SECOND PHASE 193 and follow up the enemy on his retreat; notwithstanding, it would be better if you could come on so as not to scatter the arms too much. * * * Day after day, Aguinaldo’s headquarters was besieged by patriotic rebels. By the end of May, Aguinaldo’s for ces had captured about 5,000 prisoners. Imus, Paranaque, Bakood, and Las Pinas were captured from the enemy within a week. In Pampanga, San Fernando and Macabebe were captured by the rebels, for cing the Spanish general, Monet, to run for his life. Laguna, Batangas, Bulakan, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Tayabas (Quezon), and Camarines were up in arms and declared their loyalty to Aguinaldo.

On May 28, General Augustin called the first and only Consultative Assembly and appoi ted prominent mestizos to sit in it. His purpose in calling the Consultative Assembly was to win over to his side the wealthy and in fluential segment of the Filipinos, namely, the mestizos, and to make it appear that he had the welfare of the Filipinos at heart. Actually, however, the Con¬ sultative Assembly was nothing but a decoration, for its function was purely advisory and did not have the right to in itiate reforms. Augustin’s at tempts to win oyer the Filipinos to the side of Spain failed. The Siege of Manila. What was then known as the City of Manila was the Walled City or lntramuros. The districts out¬ side the City were called arrabales or suburbs. Soon after the destruction of the Spanish navy, Dewey blockaded Manila to prevent Spanish ships from entering or leaving the bay. Though HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 194 helpless in the face of a powerful enemy, the Spaniards never¬ the less continued hoping for a miracle. Dewey had so far not in vaded or bombarded the city, where thousands of Spaniards had sought refuge. Dewey thought that it was useless to conquer the city by arms, for he did not have enough men to occupy it. He waited for reinforcements from the United States. Mean¬ while, the Filipino for ces under Aguinaldo besieged the city in an at tempt to starve out the enemy within its walls. The suburbs, like Tondo, Santa Cruz, San Juan del Monte, and as far north as Kalookan, teemed with Filipino soldiers. To make the siege effective, Aguinaldo cut off the city’s food and water supply. So effective was the strategy that the people in side the city — Spaniards, as well as Filipinos and aliens — suffered from hunger and thirst. It was only a matter of weeks before the Spanish authorities would surrender to Aguinaldo. On June 6, and again the following day, Aguinaldo of fered Governor-General Augustin honorable surrender. But Augustin, thinking more of Spanish honor than his life, stubbornly re¬ fused to accept surrender, for in the Spanish code of honor the word surrender was non-existent. With this refusal, Aguinaldo continued the siege in the belief that hunger and thirst would finally compel the governor to give up the struggle. The Spanish-American Secret Agreement.—The first Amer¬ ican reinforcements Dewey had been waiting for arrived on June 30, 1898, under the command of General Thomas Ander¬ son. On July 17, the second reinforcements, headed by General Francis V. Greene, arrived. With fresh troops, the Americans were confident that they could easily dislodge the Spaniards from the city. Hope of an easy victory filled their hearts when the third reinforcements, headed by General Arthur Mac-Arthur, arrived on July 31. Preparation were immediately made for the battle that would determine the fate of Manila. For several nights, some Spanish soldiers outside the city skirmished with the Americans, resulting in a few casualties. Meanwhile, Dewey made use of his in born diplomatic skill. He thought that the surrender of Manila could be affected with¬ out the use of arms. Consequently, he started negotiations with Augustin, through the Belgian consul, Andre, regarding the surrender of Manila. But when the Peninsular Government heard of Augustin’s plan to surrender, it relieved him as governor and appointed General Fermin Jaudenes in his stead. Jaudenes, THE REVOLUTION: SECOND PHASE 195 like Augustin, believed that the Spanish position was hopeless in the face of a superior enemy and in the face of the Filipino rebels. To save face, he in sisted that to satisfy the Spanish code of honor there should be a mock battle, after which the Spanish armed for ces would surrender. He further in sisted that the Fili¬ pinos rebels should be excluded from participating in the surrender of Manila, that is to say, they should not be allowed to enter the city. Dewey and Merritt accepted the terms even if it meant treachery to their ally, General Aguinaldo. Dewey went so far as to promise to hold back the Filipino troops while the mock battle was being enacted. This agreement between Jaudenes, on one hand, and Dewey and Merritt, on the other, / was so secret that no one else in either camp knew of its existence. Beginnings of the Filipino-American Rift.—At the time that Dewey was waiting for reinforcements, Aguinaldo and his for ces were laying siege to Manila. This situation was favorable to the Americans, for they did not have to be on the lookout for any hostile Spanish maneuver since the job of watchdog was being done by their Filipino allies. It was Dewey’s policy not to provoke an armed conflict with the Spaniards until after the arrival of the reinforcements. When, finally, the latter arrived, General Wesley Merritt decided that the of fensive against Manila should be conducted along the bay side. Since this position was occupied by the Filipinos, he in structed General Francis V. Greene to ask for Aguinaldo’s cooperation in the drive against their common enemy. By “cooperation” Merritt meant the evacuation of the bay side area by the Filipino troops so that the Americans could occupy it. Aguinaldo demanded that the request for the evacuation be made in writing. Greene promised he would after the evacuation. With this verbal promise, Aguinaldo with drew his troops to give way to the Americans. Greene, however, did not honor his word. The continuous stream of American reinforcements worried Aguinaldo no end. He wondered why, in spite of the fact that the Spaniards were then at the mercy of the Filipino troops, American reinforcements continue to pour on in numbers. His suspicions of ultimate American in tentions, however, he kept to himself"

His suspicions of ultimate American in tentions, however, he kept to himself. But other Filipino military leaders were harboring the same suspicions. General Artemio Ricarte, for example, expressed his doubts as to American in tentions and warned Aguinaldo “to be careful because it seems that the Americans, want to fool us.” General Pfo del Pilar also unburdened him- 196 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE self of the same feeling to Aguinaldo and suggested that batteries be mounted in certain places to prevent the Americans from passing through them. Meanwhile, the Americans began to improve their positions. With this advantage and the fact that Dewey and Merritt had already made a secret agreement with the enemy regarding the exclusion of the Filipino troops from the Walled City, the Americans became more and more secure in their improved po¬ sitions. So secure were they that on the eve of the mock assault on Manila, General Anderson had the in solence to telegraph Aguinaldo: “Do not let your troops enter Manila with out per¬ mission from the American commander. On this side of the Pasig River you will be under fire.” Such an at titude served to in crease Aguinaldo’s suspicions of American in tentions. What began as a friendly alliance worsened into silent hostility. The Mock Battle of Manila.—The assault on Manila was to have begun on Augnst 10. Bad weather, however, delayed the planned action. On August 7, Dewey and Merritt issued a joint ultimatum to Jaudenes telling him to evacuate the non-comba¬ tants to safe places as the American land and naval for ces would start operations “against the defenses of Manila.” Jaudenes asked the opinion of high Spanish of ficials, in cluding the Arch¬ bishop, on what to do. Since there was no unanimity of opinion he waited till the next day to give his answer. Another ultimatum was issued to him on August 9 asking him to surrender the city and his for ces. Jaudenes asked for sufficient time to consult with his government, but Dewey and Merritt turned down the request. The morning of August 13 was dark and heavy with clouds. Then the rains poured and drenched the soldiers. The Filipino troops, armed to the teeth, position the mselves on the right flank of General Arthur Mac Arthur, ready to rush into the fray. Despite requests from General Anderson not to advance his troops when the at tack commenced, Aguinaldo stood pat on his decision to participate in the assault on Manila. * ' The plan of at tack was for Dewey’s ships to bombard Fort M\\n Antonio A bad. General Greene was to advance from the direction of Mai ate, while General Mac Arthur was to at tack iiom the direction of Singalong. At 9:30 in the morning, the THE REVOLUTION: SECOND PHASE 197 Olympia began the bombardment of the Spanish positions in the Fort, followed a little later by the other warships. Greene began his advance almost an hour later, while Mac Arthur com¬ menced his advance about 11:00 A. M. The Filipino troops then moved in closer to the walls of the city. There was a short display of fireworks on the side of the enemies. The Spaniards hoisted the white flag of surrender at the southwest bastion of the walls at about 11:20 A. M., but it was not until 12:0 C noon that General Greene noticed it. Manila had “fallen”. \\ ' ''' r Terms of Capitulation.—General Greene, upon seeing the white flag, rushed into the open Bagumbayan Field, followed by a handful of soldiers. Traversing what is now the City Hall, Greene, accompanied by his chief of staff. Captain Bates, took a carriage and entered the city at the Puerto Real. He was on his way to the Ayuntamiento to confer with General Jaudenes. Meanwhile, Admiral Dewey sent his flag lieutenant, Brumby, a* his representative to the surrender negotiations. Merritt, on the other hand, personally went to the Ayuntamiento to negotiate the surrender of Manila. It was about five in the afternoon when the terms of capitulation were agreed upon by both sides. By the terms of the agreement, the Spanish authorities agreed to surrender the Spanish troops and the Filipino volunteers found in side the Walled City. The Americans, on the other hand, agreed to safeguard the city, its in habitants, its churches, and religious worship. The following day, Sunday, August 14, the document containing the terms of surrender was for mally signed by the representatives of both parties. The Protocol of Peace.—Before the mock assault on Manila, Spain and the United States were negotiating for the cessation of hostilities. On August 10, Secretary of State Day submitted to the representative of Spain, Jules Cam bon, the French ambassador to Washington, a draft of the protocol with pro¬ vided for the appointment of not more than five commissioners on each side to discuss the peace treaty. The peace commissioners were to meet in Paris not later than October 1. Moreover, the draft also provided for the cessation of the Spanish-American hostilities. Spain agreed to sign these terms. Consequently, on August 12, Washington time, President Mc Kinley issued a proclamation directing that “all military operations against the enemy be suspended.” This proclamation was cabled to General Merrit on the same day, but because Dewey cut the cable between Manila and the outside world after the battle of Manila Bay, 198 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Merrit did not receive the proclamation until the afternoon of August 16, when the mock battle of Manila had already been “fought” and the terms of capitulation signed. Thus, the mock battle of Manila would not have been “fought” and Spanish honor would have been saved had not Dewey cut the cable earlier"

To show the capacity of the Filipinos for self-government, Aguinaldo established the Dictatorial Government in May and, a month later, the Revo¬ lutionary Government. Different departments were created to take charge of the multifarious duties of the new government. In September the Congress was convoked at Malolos and a con¬ stitution prepared to guide the government in its progress to¬ ward republicanism. Diplomatic agents were sent abroad to work for the recognition of Philippine in dependence. But the United States, however, had decided to take over control of the Philippines, and in December 1898 the Treaty of Paris between Spain and the United States was concluded. The treaty gave the Philippines to the United States. Even so, the Filipino leaders proclaimed the Philippine Republic in Malolos with Aguinaldo as President. The Dictatorial Government.—In the wake of his military victories, Aguinaldo decided that it was time to establish a Fili¬ pino government. He had with him when he arrived from Hong¬ kong a draft of a plan prepared by Mariano Ponce for the estab¬ lishment of a revolutionary government: Consul Wildman, how¬ ever, had advised Aguinaldo earlier to establish a dictatorial government which later on could be the nucleus of a republican government similar to that of the United States. Probably because the critical times demanded a government with a strong executive, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Aguinaldo’s adviser, told him to form a dictatorial government. Consequently, Aguinaldo made known his in tention of establishing such form of government when he announced, in the morning of May 24,1898, that he was assuming “command of all the troops in the struggle for the at tainment of our lofty aspirations, in augurating a dictatorial government to be administered by decrees promulgated under my sole responsibility...” Later iii the day, he issued a decree for mally establishing the Dictatorial Government. The decree 199 200 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE nullified the or ders issued under the authority of the Biyak-na- Bato Republic and asserted that the Dictatorial Government was temporary in nature, “so that, when peace shall have been reestablished and our legitimate aspiration for unrestricted liberty at tained, it may be modified by the nation, in which rests the principle of authority. Treatment of Enemy.—In general, the Filipinos treated the Spanish prisoners with justice. But there were times when, be¬ cause of hatred of the for mer masters, the Filipinos exceeded their enthusiasm and maltreated some Spaniards. Aguinaldo, wishing his people to follow the paths of righteousness and jus¬ tice, appealed to them to treat the Spanish prisoners humanely. One of Aguinaldo’s first acts as Dictator was to issue a circular, dated May 29, 1898, urging the people to stop the disgraceful treatment of the Spanish prisoners. He said: It happens very of ten that the people and our soldiers, carried off by the triumph, for get all my previous advice in regard to the treatment which they rught to accord to the prisoners, and, you will enucavor to stop this disgraceful conduct to ward the sur¬ rendered enemy, and to punish those who may disobey your or ders. To maintain peace and or der and to suppress crimes, Agui¬ naldo issued another or der on June 1 providing that all classes of crimes were to be tried by competent military tribunals. Again and again, he impressed upon the people the necessity of respect¬ ing the persons and property of the enemy. Declaration of Independence—With a government in ope¬ ration, Aguinaldo thought that it was necessary to declare the in dependence of the Philippines. He believed that such a move would in spire the people to fight more eagerly against the Span¬ iards and at the same time lead the. for eign countries to recog¬ nize the in dependence of the country. Mabini, who had by now been made Aguinaldo’s unofficial adviser, objected. He based his objection on the fact that it was more important to reorganize the government in such a manner as to convince the for eign powers of the competence and stability of the new government than to proclaim Philippine in dependence at such an early period. Aguinaldo, however, stood his ground and won. On June 5, Aguinaldo issued a decree setting aside June 12 as the day for the proclamation of Philippine in dependence. At the same time, he commissioned Julian Felipe, a composer THE MALOLOS REPUBLIC 201 from Cavite, to prepare a composition which would be played during the in dependence ceremonies. On June 11, Felipe showed Aguinaldo the draft of his musical composition, which was en¬ titled Marcha Filipina Magdalo. Aguinaldo and other revolu¬ tion ary leaders, upon hearing the composition played on the piano, adopted it as the of ficial march of the Philippines. Agui¬ naldo then requested Felipe to teach the music to the members of the band of San Francisco de Malabon so it could be played the next day. Felipe changed the title of the march to Marcha National Filipina (Philippine National March). On June 12, between four and five in the afternoon, Agui¬ naldo, in the presence of a huge crowd, proclaimed the inde¬ pendence of the Philippines at Cavite el Viejo (Kawit). For the first time, the Philippine National Flag, made in Hongkong by Mrs. Marcela Agoncillo, assisted by Lorenza Agoncillo and Delfina Herboza, was of ficially hoisted and the Philippine National March played in public. The Act of the Declaration of Inde¬ pendence was prepared by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, who also read it"

The Act of the Declaration of Inde¬ pendence was prepared by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, who also read it. A passage in the Declaration reminds one of another passage in the American Declaration of Independence. The Philippine Declaration was signed by ninety-eight persons, among them an American army of ficer who witnessed the proclamation. The proclamation of Philippine in dependence was, however, promulgated on August 1 when many to wns had already been or ganized under the rules laid down by the Dictatorial Govern¬ ment. Apolinario Mabini.—It was immediately before the procla¬ mation of in dependence that a young man was brought before Aguinaldo as his adviser. He was Apolinario Mabini. Bom of very poor parents, Inocencio Mabini and Dionisia Maranan, in Talaga, Tanawan, Batangas, Mabini studied in a school in Tanawan, then conducted by a certain Simplicio Avelino. Much later, he transferred to a school conducted by the famous peda¬ gogue, Father Valerio Malabanan. He continued his studies at San Juan de Letran and at the University of Sto. Tomas, where he received his law degree in 1894. His dream to defend the poor led him to for sake the priesthood, which his mother want¬ ed him to take. Early in 1896, he contracted an illness, probably in fantile paralysis, that led to the paralysis of his lower limbs. When the revolution broke out the same year, the Spanish au¬ thorities, suspecting that he was somehow in volved in the dis¬ turbance, arrested him. The fact, however, that he could not 202 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE move his lower limbs showed the Spaniards that they had made a mistake. He was released and sent to the San Juan de Dios Hospital. Mabini, it must be noted, was not entirely free from nationalistic association, for he was a member of Rizal’s La Liga Filipina and worked secretly for the in troduction of re¬ forms in the administration of the government. In 1898, while vacationing in Los Banos, Aguinaldo sent for him. It took hun¬ dred of men taking turns at carrying the hammock he was in to bring Mabini to Kawit. Aguinaldo, upon seeing Mabini’s physical condition, thought that he mtist have made a mistake in calling for him to help him in his work. What could a man in such condition do to help him? But when Mabini spoke, Aguinaldo’s doubts vanished. There was firmness in the sick man’s voice, and Aguinaldo decided to make him his trusted adviser. From then on, it was Mabini who stood behind Agui¬ naldo. Envious enemies called him the “Dark Chamber of the President,” but his admirers considered him the “Brains of the Revolution.” Reorganization of Local Government.—Because Mabini be¬ lieved in or der, he prepared a decree for Aguinaldo’s signature. Believing in the democratic principles, Mabini in serted in the decree a statement to the effect that it was “the first duty of the government to in terpret faithfully the popular will.” Ma¬ bini wanted Aguinaldo to be surrounded by representatives close to the people and who knew their needs so that the head of the State could take measures to meet those needs. Conse¬ quently, the Decree of June 18, 1898 provided for the reorgani¬ zation of local government in those provinces already freed from Spanish control. Made electors were those in habitants who were prominent for their high character and social posi¬ tion. These electors were to elect the town chief, the headman for each barrio, and three delegates, namely, the delegate for police and in ternal or der, the delegate for justice and civil reg¬ istry, and the delegate for taxes and property. The town chief, the headmen of the barrios, and the three delegates constituted the Popular Assembly. The town chief was to act as president of the assembly, with the headman of the poblacion or town proper as vice-president, and the delegate for justice and civil registry as secretary. The chiefs of the to wns, in consultation with their respec¬ tive popular assemblies, elected the provincial chief and three councilors. The provincial chief, the chief of the capital of the province, and the three councilors constituted the Provincial THE MALOLOS RE PUBLIC 203 Council, whose chief duty was to propose measures for the gen¬ eral welfare of the in habitants of the province. The decree also provided for the election of delegates from each province who would constitute the Revolutionary Con¬ gress. These delegates were to be elected by the chiefs of the to wns. The proportion of delegates to the Congress was made as follows: for the City of Manila and the province of Cavite, three delegates each; for the province of the first class, two delegates each; for the rest of the provinces, one delegate each. The main function of the Revolutionary Congress was, according to the decree, “to propose... measures concerning the preser¬ vation of in ternal or der and external security of these islands...” In or der to secure maximum efficiency in the implementa¬ tion of the rules regarding the holding of elections, the decree provided for the appointment of a commissioner of the Central Government for each province. The military commanders who liberated any town from the Spaniards became automatically commissioners “by virtue of their of fice.” Administration of Justice.-'The administration of justice was outlined in a supplementary decree of June 20, 1898, be¬ cause of the complex problems connected with the establishment of courts. The decree provided that the Spanish Penal Code, when not contrary to the decree of the government, was to re¬ main in force for the time being.

Then the Provincial Council was to or der the accused to appear in public for his trial. The decision of the Provincial Council may be appealed to the Commission of Justice of the Revolutionary Congress. In civil cases, the decisions were made by the Popular Assembly. These decisions could be appealed to the Provincial Council. The decision in each case was considered temporary and may be amended by courts of competent jurisdiction after the proclamation of the Republic and when the “administration of justice shall have been duly or ganized.” The Revolutionary Government.—The Dictatorial Govern¬ ment lasted for only a month, from May 24 to June 23, 1898. At the in stance of Mabini, Aguinaldo delivered on June 23 a 204 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE message, penned l; y Mabini, giving his reasons for changing the form of government to a revolutionary one. On the same day, Aguinaldo issued a decree setting up the Revolutionary Govern¬ ment. It changed the title of the chief of state from Dictator to President and defined the object of the government as the “struggle for the in dependence of the Philippines until all nations, in cluding the Spanish, shall expressly recognize it, and to prepare the country so that the true republic may be established.” To help the President in his duties, four departments were created, namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Navy and Commerce, the Department of War and Public Works, the Department of Police and Inte... al Order, Justice, Education and Hygiene, and the Department of Finance, Agriculture and Manufacturing Industry. The department secretaries were not responsible for the decrees of the President, but they were to sign them “with the President to give them authority.” The President appointed the department secretaries and the personnel of each department. The decree also provided for the creation of Congress. As has been seen, the decree of June 18 provided for the election of delegates from each province to represent it in Congress. The degree of June 23 provided that in those provinces which had not been pacified, that is to say, provinces which had not been taken from the Spaniards, the delegates for said provinces were to be appointed by the President. The powers of Congress were defined as follows: To watch over the general in terest of the Philippine people, and the carrying out of the revolutionary laws; to discuss and vote upon said laws; to discuss and approve, prior to their ratifica¬ tion, treaties and loans; to examine and approve the accounts presented annually by the Secretary of Finance, as well as extra¬ or dinary and other taxes which may be hereafter imposed. On July 15, 1898, Aguinaldo macle his first cabinet appoint¬ ments: Baldomero Aguinaldo, Secretary of War and Public Works; Leandro Ibarra, Secretary of the Interior; and Mariano Trias, Secretary of Finance. Cayetano Arellano was of fered the secretaryship of for eign affairs, but he declined, feigning illness, although actually he was in sympathy with the Americans and would not, the refore, give his services to the Filipino government. Later, Mabini accepted the position and the reby became h member of the President’s of ficial family. On September 28, Aguinaldo in creased the number of departments to six, namely, for eign affairs, war, in terior, welfare, justice, and treasury. THE MALOLOS REPUBLIC 205 The Malolos Congress.—In accordance with the decrees of June 18 and 23, Aguinaldo convoked the Revolutionary Con¬ gress at Barasoain, Malolos. Peace and or der conditions in some provinces were such that Aguinaldo was compelled to appoint their delegates to Congress. Consequently, on September 4, he appointed fifty delegates to the Congress. This number was in creased by ten on September 10. The number of delegates to the Congress fluctuated from time to time. In the morning of September 15, the basilica of Barasoain was filled with delegates and spectators. Outside, the Banda Pasig played the National Anthem. When Aguinaldo and his of ficers arrived, the delegates, the cream of the Filipino in telli¬ gentsia, spread out to give way to the President. With the President seated, the secretary read the names of the delegates, after which Aguinaldo was in troduced. Cries of “Viva!” re¬ verberated and Aguinaldo acknowledged the applause of the throng. Then he stood up and read his message, first, in Tagalog, and then in Spanish. A round of applause followed Aguinaldo’s speech, which Felipe Buencamino wrote. Aguinaldo then an¬ nounced that the ceremonies were over and tnat Congress was to convene after electing its of ficers. In the afternoon, the Congress proceeded to elect its of ficers, namely, Pedro A. Paterno.

The first significant act of the Congress was the ratification, or September 29, of the in dependence proclaimed at Kawit on June 12. Aguinaldo, whose of fice and of ficial residence were located at the convent of Malolos Church, arrived at Ba-. asoain, where Congress was holding its sessions, amidst the “vociferous acclamations of the people and the strains of music.” The ceremonies began at 10:30 A. M., and Aguinaldo, after congratulating Paterno for having been elected to the presidency 206 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of Congress, partly said in Tagalog: * * * now we witness the truth of what the famous President Monroe said to the effect that the United States was for the Amer¬ icans; now I say that the Philippines is for the Filipinos. The Malolos Constitution.—-In preparing the decree of June 18, and that of June 23, Mabini envisioned the Congress to be an advisory body of the President. He believed that in such period as the country was passing through it was necessary to have a strong Executive. But his idea was contradicted by Congress when it proposed to draft a constitution. Congress advanced the opinion that a modem constitution answering to the needs of the times was imperative in or der to secure the recognition of Philippine in dependence by for eign powers. Ma¬ bini, on the other hand, argued that such a delicate task as the framing of the constitution should be done in a peaceful and quiet mood in or der to give the framers sufficient time to deli¬ berate on the proposed provisions. At such a period as they were undergoing, it was not proper to frame a constitution. Moreover, Mabini added that Congress was convoked not to frame a constitution, but to advise the President and to give him popular support. Mabini was, however, in the minority, and although his arguments were unassailable he was defeated by the majority under the leadership of Patemo. Nevertheless, Mabini submitted his Constitutional Plan of the Philippine Republic, but Congress, for the second time, overruled him. A committee to draft the constitution was created, with Fe¬ lipe G. Calderon as its most prominent member. Having set Mabini’s Constitutional Program aside, the committee, under the in fluence of Calderon, also set aside, but in a subtle manner, Patemo’s constitutional plan, which smelled strongly of the Spanish Constitution of 1869. With the advice of Cayetano Arellano, a brilliant but unreconstructed mestizo, Calderon drew up his plans for a constitution, deriving in spiration from the constitutions of Mexico, Belgium, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Brazil, and France. In the session of October 8, Calderon presented the draft of his constitution. Printed copies of it were made on October 21, and discussions began on October 25. The most tumultuous discussions occurred when the provision making Catholicism the religion of the State came up for consideration. After much heated debates on the subject, the Congress voted on it. The result was a tie. The second voting resulted in the victory of the separation of the Church and State. The partisans THE MALOLOS REPUBLIC 207 of separation won by only one vote — that of Pablo Tecson. Thus the Calderon project of making Catholicism the State religion was defeated. The provision on the subject of state religion was then amended to read: Article 5. —The State recognizes the freedom and equality of all religions, as well as the separation of the Church and State. A few other amendments were in serted in the draft constitu¬ tion before it was sent to Aguinaldo for approval. On January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo promulgated what is now known as the Malolos Constitution. The protracted discussions that characterized the Congress sessions on the subject of whether or not Church and State should be united showed, first, that the Filipinos as a people, though up in arms against Catholic Spain, were not anti-Catholic but merely anti-clerical, and second, that many of the delegates learned from the bitter lesson of Philippine history in voting against the union of Church and State which, under Spain, was the fundamental basis of Spanish colonial system. That decision became the cornerstone of Philippine democracy and showed not only the nationalism and democratic or ientation of those who voted for the separation of Church and State, but also their keen sense of history. The Constitution—The Malolos Constitution is the first important Filipino document ever produced by the people’s re¬ presentatives. It is anchored in democratic traditions that ulti¬ mately had their roots on American soil. It created a Filipino State whose government was “popular, representative and re¬ sponsible” with three distinct branches — the executive, the le¬ gislative, and the judicial.

      "context": ". The Constitution—The Malolos Constitution is the first important Filipino document ever produced by the people’s re¬ presentatives. It is anchored in democratic traditions that ulti¬ mately had their roots on American soil. It created a Filipino State whose government was “popular, representative and re¬ sponsible” with three distinct branches — the executive, the le¬ gislative, and the judicial. The constitution specifically provid¬ ed for safeguards against abuses and enumerated the national and in dividual rights not only of the Filipinos, but also of the aliens. The legislative powers were exercised by the Assembly of Representatives composed of delegates elected according to law. To make the function of Congress continuous, the document pro¬ vided for a Permanent Commission which would sit as a law¬ making body when Congress was not in session. The Assembly elected the President of the Republic. The Cabinet, composed of the Secretaries of the different Departments of the govern- 208 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ment, was responsible not to the President, but to the Assembly. The administration of justice was vested in the Supreme Court and in in ferior courts to be established according to law. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was to be elected by the Assembly with the concurrence of the President and the Cabinet. The Malolos Consituiion is unique for three reasons: first, because of the provisions making the Assembly or the legisla¬ tive branch superior to either the executive or the judicial branch; second, because it provided for a Permanent Commission to sit as a legislative body when the Assembly was not in session; and third, because it established a unicameral legislature. Calderon’s argument for the omnipotence of the legislature was that he feared the predominance of the ignorant military elements which were solidly behind Aguinaldo. To counteract their ignorance, Calderon purposely provided for a strong legislative arm, so strong that the executive, that is, Aguinaldo, would not be able to create an oligarchy composed of ignoramuses. Between an oligarchy of ignorance, as Calderon called the men who fought the enemy, and an oligarchy of in tellect, he preferred the latter. To check the executive further, Calderon made provision for the creation of a Permanent Commission, composed of Assembly delegates, which would sit as a legislative body when the Assembly was not in session. Calderon’s purpose in in cluding this provision is obvious enough: to check the powers of the executive even when the Assembly was in rececs. By this method, the executive could not usurp the powers that could make him powerful enough to in stitute an “oligarchy of ignoramuses.” As to the unicameral legislature, Calderon pointed out that there was no conflict of in terests among the people to justify the creation of a bicameral legislature. Moreover, in a country like the Philippines which was then emerging from the for mative stage, a bicameral legislature might only lead to delay ip administrative efficiency. A third reason given was that there were not enough competent Filipinos to fill the seats of a bicameral legislature. The Constitution as a whole is a monument to the capacity of the Filipinos to chart their own course along democratic lines. In a period of storm and stress, it symbolized the ideals of a people who had emerged from the Dark Ages into the light of Reason. The Philippine Republic.—Owing to the objections of Mabini to some provisions of the constitution, Aguinaldo did not im¬ mediately promulgate it. The Congress leaders compromised THE MALOLOS REPUBLIC 209 with Mabini by agreeing to in sert amendments to satisfy the President’s closest adviser. On January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo fi¬ nally promulgated the Constitution. Earlier, on January 2, he for med his Cabinet as follows: Apolinario Mabini... Teodoro Sandico... Baldomero Aguinaldo Mariano Trias. Gracio Gonzaga... President of the Cabinet and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Interior Secretary of War Secretary of Finance Secretary of Welfare, in clud¬ ing Public Instruction, Public Works, Communications, Ag¬ riculture, Industry and Com¬ merce The Council of Government, or the Cabinet, according to Ma¬ bini, “belongs to no party, nor does it desire to form one; it stands for nothing save the in terests of the fatherland.” On January 23, 1899, the Philippine Republic was inau¬ gurated at Malolos in colorful ceremonies. Aguinaldo took his oath of of fice after having been in for med that he had been pro¬ claimed President of the Republic. The Malolos Constitution was read article by article, and the army took its oath of loyalty before the President. A review of troops and procession followed. To make the event more memorable, Aguinaldo issued a decree granting pardon to all Spanish prisoners of war who were not members of the Spanish regular army and, at the same time, granting to Spaniards and other aliens the right to engage in business within the limits of the Republic. Revolutionary Periodicals.—As a struggling nation, the Philip¬ pines had to make its ideals and aspirations known to all the world so that the for eign Powers would respect and recognize its in dependence. There was need for propaganda media to broadcast these ideals and aspirations. Consequently, the Re¬ volutionary Government founded its of ficial or gan El Heraldo de la Revolucion, whose first number came out on September 29, 1898. Its name was subsequently changed to Heraldo Fili¬ pino, then to Indice Oficial, and finally, to Graceta de Filipinos, whose last number came out on October 14, 1899. These news¬ papers published the of ficial texts of the decrees of the govern¬ ment and, of course, some news items and Tagalog poems, all nationalistic in content. 210 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The revolutionary propaganda was not limited to the offi¬ cial publications of the government, however. Privately-owned newspapers took up the cause of the Filipinos and urged the people to unite and to exert more efforts in the struggle for national emancipation. Most famous of these periodicals was La Independence, edited and partly owned by General Antonio Luna. Its first number came out on September 3, 1898. On the staff of the newspaper were the great Filipino writers in Spanish, whose patriotic pieces were written under pen names: Cecilio Apostol (Catullo), Jose Palma, Rafael Palma (Dapit Hapon), Fernando Ma. Guerrero (Fulvio Gil), Epifanio de los Santos (G. Solon),. Jose G. Abreu (Kaibigan), Mariano V. del Rosario (Tito-Tato), Salvador V. del Rosario (Juan Tagalo), Rosa Sevilla, and Florentina Arellano.

So nationalistic was the periodical that the American authorities tried to suppress it, but did not succeed. Other nationalistic newspapers were La Republica Filipina, founded in Mandaluyong by Pedro A. Patemo, whose first num¬ ber came out on September 15, 1898; La Libertad, which came out on June 20, 1898 under the editorship of Clemente Jose Zu- lueta; Ang Kaibigan nang Bayan (The People’s Friend), Malo- los, 1898; Columnas Volantes (Fly Sheets), Lipa, Batangas, 1899; La Federation, Kabatuan, Iloilo, 1899; La Revolution, Jaro, Iloilo, 1898; Patria, Jaro, Iloilo, 1899; La Oportunidad, Tagbilaran, Bohol, 1899; and a few others. These newspapers, most of which were short-lived, were unanimous in their policy of fighting for the in dependence of the country. They may have been ephemeral, but their effects on the people were im¬ pressive, for they kept alive the sparks of revolutionary char¬ acter which gave the Philippines its most significant and color¬ ful epoch. Education.—The educational problem merited the at tention of the Filipino leaders. Owing to the destruction of many schools and to the peace and or der condition, all the schools were closed for the time being. The Revolutionary Government took steps to open classes as soon as circumstances permitted. On August 29, 1898, the Secretary of the Interior or dered the provincial governors to reestablish the schools that had been abandoned before. To continue giving in struction to the people, Aguinaldo in cluded in the budget for 1899 an item for public in struction amounting to P 35,000. On October 24, a decree was issued outlining the curriculum of the Burgos Institute. The curriculum THE MALOLOS REPUBLIC 211 in cluded Latin grammar, universal geography and history, Spanish literature, mathematics, French, English, physics, chemistry, philosophy, and natural laws. Higher education was provided for when, in a decree of October 19, 1898, Aguinaldo created the Literary University of the Philippines. Professors of civil and criminal law, medicine and surgery, pharmacy, and notariat were appointed. Dr. Joaquin Gonzalez was appointed first president of the University. He was succeeded by Dr. Leon Ma. Guerrero, who delivered the commencement address on September 29, 1899. The University did not live long, for the conflict with the Americans led its faculty and students to disperse. Diplomatic Activities—In or der to persuade the for eign Powers to recognize Philippine in dependence, Aguinaldo created diplomatic positions abroad. The first step taken was the pro¬ mulgation of decrees creating committees abroad for the purpose of carrying on propaganda activities for the Revolutionary Govern¬ ment. On June 24 and August 10, 1898, Aguinaldo issued two decrees providing for the establishment of the Hongkong Junta whose members were to represent the Philippines in different countries. Subsequently, the diplomatic agents were appointed: Felipe Agoncillo, for the United States; Mariano Ponce and Faustino Lichauco, for Japan; Antonio Regidor, for England; Juan Lima and Pedro Roxas, for France; and Eriberto Zarcal, for Australia. In France, the Paris Committee was established by the prominent Filipino residents of the city, and in Spain, the Madrid Committee was founded with aims similar to those of the Paris Committee, namely, to work for the recognition of Philippine in dependence by the for eign Powers. Agoncillo, accompanied by his secretary Sixto Lopez, went to the United States to work for American recognition of Phil¬ ippine in dependence, but his at tempts to secure an of ficial au¬ dience with President Mc Kinley failed. He sailed to Europe to appeal to the American Peace Commissioners to give the Fili¬ pinos a chance to be heard on a question that deeply affected their future, but in this, too, he failed. He returned to Washing¬ ton to fight the ratification of the Treaty of Paris by the Senate, but the Filipino-American hostilities for ced him to flee for his life. He returned to Paris and there continued his patriotic, if futile, activities. The Treaty of Paris.—In accordance with the Protocol of Peace signed on August 12, 1898, five American and five Span- 212 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ish commissioners were appointed to meet in Paris to discuss the final peace terms between Spain and the United States. The American commissioners were Cushman Davis, William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid, George Gray, and William R. Day, who resigned as Secretary of State to become Chairman of the American Peace Commission. The Spanish commissioners were Eugenio Montero Rfos, Chairman, and Buenaventura Abarzuza, Jose de Gamica, Wenceslao Ramirez de Villa-Urrutia, and General Rafael Cerero, members. The Peace Commission met in Paris from October to De¬ cember, 1898. Long discussions on legal points took place in which both sides refused to give in. Finally, the American com¬ missioners served an ultimatum on the Spanish commission¬ ers who believed that the Americans should be gracious and gallant in their hour of victory. But the American commis¬ sioners, having been in structed to demand the cession of the entire Philippines to the United States, were not in a mood to humor their Spanish counterparts and in sisted on their main demand, that is, the cession of the Philippines to the United States. Helpless, the Spanish commissioners finally agreed. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed. It provided that Spain would cede the Philippines to the United States in return for which she would receive $20,000,000 from the United States as payment for improvements made in the colony"

It provided that Spain would cede the Philippines to the United States in return for which she would receive $20,000,000 from the United States as payment for improvements made in the colony. Fur¬ ther, the United States agreed to give the Spaniards the right to ship commodities to the Philippines for a period of ten years on the same terms as those of the United States. The Treaty of Paris did not go into effect until after the American Senate had ratified it. The proponents of ratification did not command a majority in the Senate, for many senators believed that the treaty was unfair to the Filipinos. The un¬ for tunate rupture of Filipino-American hostilities on February 4, 1899 led many opponents of ratification to vote affirmatively. The vote was taken on February 6 and the treaty was ratified by two-thirds majority. American propaganda made it appear that the Filipinos fired the first shots that led to the Filipino- American hostilities. Consequently, the American senators who were at first against the treaty now voted for it in the belief that the Filipinos caused the rupture of Filipino-American rela¬ tions. The American propaganda, directed mainly by the in stru¬ ments of imperialists, won and the reafter the Philippines became a territory of the United States. kl. 4 K 4 ft. 13 THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES The American in sistence on the evacuation by Aguinaldo’s army of the strategic points along the Manila Bay area, the refusal of the American military authorities to allow the Filipino soldiers to enter the city after its surrender, and the American limitation of the areas to be occupied by the Filipino troops after the mock battle of Manila, led progressively to the deterioration of Filipino- American relations. The misunderstandings that followed these in cidents climaxed in the signing of the Treaty of Paris with out consultation with the Filipinos. Attempts, however, were made by a mixed commission of Filipinos and Americans to relax the tension between the two peoples, but the American members of the commission tried to prolong the sessions with out trying to improve the situation because they were waiting for the Amer¬ ican reinforcements which were then on their way to Manila. Finally, on February 4, 1899, an American sentry shot a Filipino soldier, resulting in the outbreak of the Filipino-American hos¬ tilities. The Filipinos fought at a disadvantage, for they had no sufficient arms with which to fight the enemy. But it took the Americans almost three years to conquer the Filipinos. American Apostasy.—It must be remembered that it was the Americans who first approached Aguinaldo in Hongkong and in Singapore to persuade him to cooperate with Commo¬ dore Dewey in wresting the power from the Spaniards. While it may not be true that Dewey promised Aguinaldo American recognition of Philippine in dependence, yet it is nevertheless true that there was an in for mal alliance between Dewey and Aguinaldo — an alliance to fight a common enemy, the Span¬ iards. There was, the refore, a moral as well as a legal basis for the American authorities to treat Aguinaldo as an ally. And yet when the^ finally succeeded in in creasing their number in the Philippines and in agreeing secretly to the surrender of Manila, they treated Aguinaldo as if he were. anl escaped convict. There was absolutely no reason why the Americans should not have allowed their Filipino allies to share the hour of glory in the surrender of Manila; there was much less reason why the Amer- 213 214 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE icans should have or dered Aguinaldo to with draw ifrom the suburbs of Manila after the surrender of the city. Such American actua¬ tion showed that they used Aguinaldo merely as a tool for their own selfish purpose. More significantly, their at titude to wards Aguinaldo showed that they came to the Philippines not as a friend, but as an enemy masking as a friend. It was, the refore, not strange that Aguinaldo and his men looked upon the Americans with suspicion. In such an at mos¬ phere all that could be expected was friction. When, in Decem¬ ber 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed with out even consulting the Filipino people and their representatives, the Filipino- American alliance that was for ged under the pressure of necessity gave way to mutual hostility. Mc Kinley’s “Benevolent Assimilation” Proclamation.—Before the conclusion of the Treaty of Paris, President Mc Kinley pretend¬ ed not to know what to do with the Philippines. Actually, there were American vested in terests who pressured him into taking the Philippines from Spain: the American economic in terests who were thinking of expanding American business in the Orient; the naval and military in terests who wanted the Philippines as the first line of American defense; and the religious in terests who wanted the Philippines as a base of operations for American Protestant missionaries. Mc Kinley could not ignore these vested in terests and so he finally in structed the American peace com¬ missioners in Paris to demand the cession of the Philippines to the United States. It is evident that from the outset the Amer¬ icans never really in tended to help the Filipinos win their in¬ dependence from Spain, for had it been otherwise they would not have sent successive reinforcements to the Philippines. With the Treaty of Paris concluded to the satisfaction of the American vested in terests, Mc Kinley issued his co-called “Benevolent Assimilation” Proclamation on December 21, 1898. This proclamation was the first of ficial in dication of American policy regarding the Philippines. It expressly in dicated the in¬ tention of the United States to stay in the Philippines by exer¬ cising the right of sovereignty over the Filipinos. In other words, the United States would assume control and disposition of the government of the Philippines"

In other words, the United States would assume control and disposition of the government of the Philippines. At the same time, President Mc Kinley in structed his military commanders in the Philippines to extend American sovereignty over the entire country by force. General El well Otis, who received the proclamation, sat on THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 215 it for a time in or der not to antagonize the Filipinos further, for he knew that they were in a bad mood. Thus he reasoned out: After fully considering the President’s proclamation and the temper of the Tagalog with whom I was daily discussing political problems and the friendly in tentions of the United States Govern¬ ment to wards them. I concluded that there were certain words and expressions the rein such as “sovereignty,” “right of cession,” and those which directed immediate occupation, etc., though most admirably employed, and tersely expressive of actual conditions, might be advantageously used by the Tagalog war party to in cite widespread hostilities among the natives. The ignorant classes had been taught to believe that certain words as “sovereignty,” “pro¬ tection,” etc., had a peculiar meaning disastrous to their welfare and significant of future political domination, like that from which they had recently been freed. In or der to comply with the President’s or der and at the same time not to, antagonize unduly the Filipinos, Otis published Mc Kinley’s Proclamation on January 4, 1899 with some amend¬ ments in serted in such a way as not to convey the meanings of the or iginal “sovereignty,” “protection,” and “right of cession.” Filipino Reaction.—Unfortunately for the Americans, how¬ ever, General Miller, then in Iloilo, published the or iginal text of the proclamation. A copy fell into the hands of the of ficials of the Revolutionary Government. The Proclamation was im¬ mediately subjected to severe at tacks. Antonio Luna, editor of La Independence, led the at tack on the proclamation and pointed out that it was “merely a subterfuge to quiet the people temporarily until measures could be in augurated and applied to put in practice all the odious features of government which Spain had employed” in the Philippines. On January 5, Agui- naldo issued a counter-proclamation in which he said partly: My government cannot remain in different in view of such a violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a nation which arrogated to itself the title of champion of oppressed x nations. Thus it is that my government is disposed to open hosti¬ lities if the American troops at tempt to take for cible possession of the Visayan islands. I denounce these acts before the world, in or der that the conscience of mankind may pronounce its in fallible verdict as to who are true oppressors of nations and the to rmentors of mankind... 216 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE In a revised proclamation issued the same day, Aguinaldo pro¬ tested “most solemnly against his in trusion of the United States Government on the sovereignty of these islands.” Otis regarded the two Aguinaldo proclamations as tanta¬ mount to war. He quietly strengthened the American observa¬ tion posts and alerted his troops. The tense at mosphere of the period was reflected in the evacuation of the Filipinos in and around Manila to safer places. On the other hand, Aguinaldo’s proclamations drew the masses to gether with a vigorous deter¬ mination to fight the ally turned enemy. Attempts to Relax the Tension.—Aguinaldo, however, tried his best to relax the Filipino-American tension. He knew that an armed conflict with the Americans would necessitate more and bitter sacrifices on the part of the people and that not having sufficient arms and ammunition the Filipino troops would be a terrible disadvantage. Consequently, he wrote Otis on January 9 notifying him of the appointment of Florentino Torres, Am¬ brosia Flores, and Manuel Arguelles to meet with the same number of American commissioners. The purpose of the meeting of the commissioners was to work out a plan for the “adjustment of the conflicting political in terests” of both parties. On the same day, Otis appointed General R. P. Hughes, Colonel James F. Smith, and Lieutenant-Colonel E. H. Crowder to meet with the Filipino commission. The conference began on January 9 and continued in termittently up to January 29. All through the series of conferences, the American panel tried to fool the Filipino panel into believing that they (the Americans) were ready to hear and to consider Filipino aspirations. In reality, however, they wanted the conference to continue in definitely pending the arrival of American reinforcements from the United States. The situation, the refore, was this: since the American volunteers in Manila were not enough to fight the Filipinos, it was necessary for the Amer¬ ican commissioners to prolong the conference with the Filipino commissioners in or der to give the American reinforcements time to arrive in the Philippines before hostilities could start. The conference did not yield any tangible result. Nor did it succeed in relaxing the Filipino-American tension. On the contrary, the Filipino military of ficers suspected that the Amer¬ icans were merely fighting for time.

But Torres was only a minor of ficial whose voice in the government was negligible. And so the tension in creased with no hope of relaxation. The San Juan Bridge Incident.-“Incident followed in cident which in evitably led to the outbreak of hostilities. On February 1, a group of American engineers was arrested by the Filipino troops. The following day, Otis filed a protest with Aguinaldo. The latter replied that the five Americans were not arrested but merely detained. Aguinaldo further pointed out that the Americans were found well within the Filipino lines and that they were detained in accordance with the decree of October 20, 1898 prohibiting for eigners from approaching the Filipino defensive works. On the same day, February 2, General Arthur Mac Arthur protested the presence of Colonel Luciano San Miguel’s soldiers within his territory. San Miguel, wanting to avoid any conflict with the Americans, or dered his men to with draw from the American side. The tension seemed to have been relaxed a little when on the night of February 4, an in cident occurred which led to the outbreak of the Filipino-American hostilities. At about eight in the evening of February 4, Private Willie W. Grayson, with two other members of his patrol, advanced ahead of the village in San Juan to ascertain whether there were Filipino soldiers in the vicinity. Suddenly four armed men appeared before Grayson. He said later, recounting the event: I yelled “Halt!”... the man moved. I challenged with another “Halt!” Then he immediately shouted “Halto!” to me. Well I thought the best thing to do was to shoot him. He dropped. * * * We retreated to where our six other fellows were and I said, “Line up fellows; the enemy are in here all through these yards.” We then retreated to the pipe line and got behind the water work main and stayed there all night. It was some minutes after our second shots before Filipinos began firing. The following day, Mac Arthur, with out at tempting to find out the cause of the firing, issued his or der to advance against the Filipino troops. The Filipino-American armed clash was on. Investigation of the Incident.—That same night, Captain 218 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Fernando Grey wired Malolos saying that the Americans had started the hostilities. Aguinaldo could not do anything at the moment, but the next day he sent an emissary to Otis to con¬ vey to the American commander that “the firing on our side the night before had been against my or der.” Furthermore, he expressed his wish to stop further hostilities. Otis, who was sure of American victory, answered that the “fighting, having begun, must go on to the grim end.” Aguinaldo then sent a telegram to all local chiefs in for ming them of the start of the Filipino-American hostilities and or dering them to prepare the people for any emergency. To determine the or igin of the hos¬ tilities he or dered Felipe Buencamino, Sr. to start an in vestiga¬ tion. On February 7, Buencamino asked Secretary of War Bal- domero Aguinaldo for in for mation regarding the in cident. In¬ vestigations were conducted and witnesses called to testify on what they knew about the event. It appeared from the in vesti¬ gations that the senior military of ficers were not at their posts on the night of February 4, but were in Malolos with Aguinaldo. It was also learned that on February 2 and 3, the Filipino em¬ ployees in American ships were dismissed from the service for no reason at all, and that in the morning of February 4 some 200 to 300 American soldiers boarded two cascos in Manila and were to wed to Cavite. Upon their arrival here they were not disembarked but sent back to Manila where they joined the other American contingents. The fact, too, that the American at tack on the Filipino troops was sudden showed that the Amer¬ icans had planned the in cident to force the issue against the Filipinos. On the other hand, the American military authorities made no at tempt to in vestigate the in cident. Instead, they or dered an all-out at tack against their for mer allies. American Victories.—With swift strokes, the American army knifed through Pasig and other to wns south of Manila. In the north, General Mac Arthur pushed ahead with his columns, bombarding the Filipino positions with accuracy. In the battle of La Loma, near the Chinese cemetery, Major Jose Torres Bugal- lon, one of the bravest of ficers, fell mortally wounded. With La Loma secure in his hands, Mac Arthur proceeded to wards Kalo- okan, where General Antonio Luna was waiting for him. In the fierce battle that followed, American superiority in arms once more proved victorious. Undaunted by his defeat, Luna prepared THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 219 a plan for the recapture of Manila. On February 22, he marched against the city, burning the houses in the suburbs to create confusion in the ranks of the enemy. Two days later, Luna’s for ces reached Azcarraga, but the Americans fought back and repulsed him with heavy losses. Luna then retreated to Polo where he established his headquarters. The Drive to the North.-Tn late February and early March, American reinforcements arrived from the United States, General Otis then began his in tensive drive to the north and or dered General Henry W. Lawton to take the of fensive in the south. Polo was taken, followed by the town along the Manila-Dagupan Railway, until on March 30 the American army was knocking at the gates of Malolos. Meanwhile, the Aguinaldo government had evacuated Malolos and established its headquarters in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija"

Meanwhile, the Aguinaldo government had evacuated Malolos and established its headquarters in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. Mac Arthur wanted to pursue Aguinaldo, but Otis or dered him to take a rest in Malolos. Meantime, General Lawton moved swiftly to the south, capturing Zapote, Bacoor, and Dasmarinas, all in Cavite. On the other hand, General Wheaton, aided by gunboats, successively captured Las Pinas and Paranaque, in Morong, and Santa Cruz, Paete, and other to wns of Laguna. But the Americans were not always victorious. On March 25, Filipino made a good account of the mselves when they repulsed General Wheaton at Polo and killed Colonel Egbert. In Quingua (Plaridel), on April 23, the American cavalry under Major Bell suffered a defeat in the hands of General Gregorio del Pilar. In this battle, the Americans suffered heavy casualties, in cluding Colonel Stotsenberg who was killed in battle. On December 18, 1899, the Filipinos under General Licerio Geronimo routed the Americans under General Lawton, who was killed in the battle of San Mateo. But these Filipino victories, however, were not sufficient to turn the tide against the Americans. The Filipino troops were poorly trained, poorly armed, poorly fed, and had no discipline. After resting his men in Malolos, Mac Arthur now decided to march against Kalumpit. The Filipinos, under General Luna, were in a good position to give battle to the enemy, for the Americans had to cross creeks and rivers to dislodge the Filipino defenders. Important to the Filipinos was the Bagbag River which afforded them good protection against the enemy. Mac¬ Arthur decided to encircled the Filipino defenders of Kalumpit by sending his subordinate of ficers to Quingua and Pulilan, while 220 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE he confronted Luna directly. At the precise moment when the enemy was about to launch his at tack, General Luna, irked by the in subordination of General Tomas Mascardo, left Kalum- pit with his artillery, cavalry, and foot soldiers to punish Mas¬ cardo who was then in Pampanga. General Gregorio del Pilar was left to defend the Filipino lines, but American superiority in strategy and arms proved too much for the “boy general.” When Luna returned to Kalumpit before nightfall, the Amer¬ icans had already succeeded in penetrating the Filipino defen¬ sive lines. Thus, the battle of Bagbag was lost and with it the other battles that followed. The Fall of Mabini.—Mabini, as President of the Cabinet, was the most powerful man behind Aguinaldo. When the United States, through the Schurman Commission, announced the policy of the American Government of extending its sovereignty over the Philippines, Mabini urged the Filipinos to continue the bitter struggle for in dependence. In a manifesto dated at San Isidro, April 15,1899, he said: And since war is the last resource that is left to us for the salvation of our country and our own national honor, let us fight while a grain of strength is left us; let us acquit ourselves like men, even though the lot of the present generation is conflict and sacrifice. It matters not whether we die in the midst or at the end of our most painful day’s work; the generations to come, praying over our to mbs, will shed for us tears of love and gratitude, and not of bitter reproach. On May 5, Secretary of State John Hay cabled the Schur¬ man Commission authorizing it to of fer autonomy to the Fili¬ pinos. Mabini stood for in dependence under the Protection of the United States, but the prominent members of the Malolos Government, like Patemo and Buencamino, wavered and want¬ ed to accept the American of fer of autonomy. Believing more in autonomy than in in dependence under the circumstances, the in fluential members of the Filipino Assembly (for merly Con¬ gress) passed a resolution asking Aguinaldo to repudiate Ma- bini’s in dependence stand and to relieve him as President of the Cabinet. Under this pressure, Aguinaldo, on May 7, 1899, wrote Mabini notifying him of the for mation of a new Cabinet under Patemo. The following day, Mabini answered Aguinaldo congratulating him on his “wise political measure.” With Ma- bini’s resignation, the executive arm of the government was reorganized. Seven departments were created: for eign affairs, 221 THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES treasury, in terior, war and navy, communications and public works, public in struction, and agriculture, in dustry and com¬ merce. The new Cabinet under Patemo was composed of: Pedro A. Patemo. President of the Cabinet Felipe Buencamino. Secretary of Foreign Affairs Severino de las Alas. Secretary of the Interior Mariano Trias... Secretary of War and Navy Hugo Hagan... Secretary of the Treasury Aguedo Velarde... Secretary of Public Instruction Maximo Molo... Secretary of Communications and Public Works Leon Ma. Guerrero. Secretary of Industry, Agriculture and Commerce Assassination of Luna.—Of all the Filipino soldiers of the period, Antonio Luna was the best prepared to fight the Amer¬ ican enemy. He was educated in Europe and studied a little of military science and tactics. But Nature endowed him with an unruly temper that made men fear and hate him. When the Filipino-American armed clash broke out, he saw the necessity of in stilling discipline into the minds of the men, most of whom were peasants or men of no training at all. His plan to recap¬ ture Manila was brilliantly conceived, but lack of cooperation from the Kawit Company, who in sisted that they took or ders only from General Aguinaldo, led to disastrous results.

Luna, of course, disciplinarian that he was, resented Aguinaldo’s partiality. In several in stances during the hostilities, Luna showed his terrible temper. He or dered that houses occupied by the Amer¬ icans be burned. At another time, he or dered the shooting of civilians who violated military rules. More serious, however, was his or der to arrest the members of the Cabinet who disagreed with him in political matters. He slapped Felipe Buencamino, Sr. and accused his son, Joaquin, of cowardice. Even Mabini, peaceful man that he was, complained against Luna and even suggested to Aguinaldo that the tempestuous general be replaced. Luna, then, won many enemies who may or may not have sound reasons to hate him. Early in June 1899 when Luna was at Bayambang, Panga- 222 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE sinan, preparing the defenses for the expected battle with the enemy, he received a telegram asking him to see Aguinaldo at his headquarters in Kabanatuan. Leaving Bayambang with his aide, Colonel Francisco Roman, and some soldiers, he arrived at the convent of Kabanatuan, which served as Aguinaldo’s headquarters, early in the afternoon of June 5. One of the guards was a member of Kawit Company whom Luna had earlier recommended for punishment. He slapped the sentry and went directly upstairs. There he found Buencamino, whom he hated, and heated words were exchanged between the two. Luna w Jfc reported to have in sulted not only Buencamino but also Agui¬ naldo, who earlier in the day had gone to San Isidro to in spect the troops. A rifle report was heard and Lima rushed downstairs to upbraid the soldier who fired the shot. Near the stairs, a group of men belonging to the Kawit Company ganged up on him. Some stabbed him with daggers, while others fired at him. Luna retreated to the street, whipped his pistol and fired, but missed his target. Colonel Roman came to his succor, but he, too, was mowed down. Luna fell on the convent yard, muttering: “Cow... ards! As... sa... ssins!” He received no less than forty wounds. He was buried the next day with hon¬ ors due his rank. But his assassins were never in vestigated; nor were they punished for their high crime. American Conquest of the Visayas.—Meanwhile, Otis in¬ structed General Miller to at tack Iloilo. Miller demanded the sur¬ render of the city, but the Filipino patriots, headed by General Martin Delgado, refused and in stead decided to fight. Fight¬ ing against heavy odds, Delgado or dered the burning of the city to prevent the enemy from using it as a base of operations. On February 20, Jaro fell into the hands of the Americans; Sta. Barbara fell on the 14 th, Oton on the 19 th, and Mandurriao on the 20 th. Having subdued Iloilo, Miller sent an American warship to Cebu to demand its surrender. On February 22, Cebu surrendered to the Americans, and Lt. Col. Thomas H. Hamer was designated military governor of the province. The occupation of Cebu was, however, not as peaceful as it seemed. The dissatisfied guerrillas murdered the Filipinos who surrendered Cebu with out a fight and harassed the American soldiers by guerrilla tactics. The guerrilla leaders, Arcadio Maxilom and Leandro Fullon, threatened with death all those who collaborated and would collaborate with the enemy. Thus, the Americans had a hard time administering Cebu. THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 223 The Negros Constitution—The American occupation of Negros was easy, for the Negrenses sympathized with the Amer¬ icans and consequently raised the American flag when Iloilo was taken. A committee composed of prominent Negrenses ar¬ rived in Manila on February 21 to ask Otis to allow them to arm a battalion for the maintenance of peace and or der in the island. Otis, taking advantage of this unusual act of collabora¬ tion, granted them their request, but in for med them that the island would be placed under an American military governor. On March 1, Otis issued an or der providing for the creation of a military district composed of Panay, Cebu, and Negros to be known as the Visayan Military District. The Negrenses were allowed to meet in convention to frame their own constitution. This the Negrenses obediently followed, and the so-called “Ne¬ gros Constitution’5 was submitted to the President of the United States on July 20. Naturally, President Mc Kinley did not take it seriously. Nevertheless, the constitution became the basis “to administer its civil matters” under which the “people may enjoy the largest measure of civil liberty compatible with prevailing conditions and which shall conform to their desire...” The Bates Treaty—The Americans were very diplomatic and cheerful in dealing with the Muslims. In an at tempt to win them over, the Americans appointed General John C. Bates to negotiate a treaty with the Sultan by which the Muslims and the Americans could co-exist peacefully. There was, the refore, no at tempt on the part of the Americans to conquer the Muslims, for they knew that they would have a big fight on their hands if they made such an at tempt. With consummate skill, General Bates patiently negotiated with the Sultan of Jolo.

On the other hand, the “domestic products of the archipelago of Jolo, when carried on by the Sultan and his people within any part of the Philippines Islands, and when conducted under the American flag, shall be free, unlimited, and undutiable.” Moreover, the American Government agreed to pay the Sultan and his leading men monthly salaries in Mexican dollars. With the conclusion of this treaty, the Americans succeeded in neutralizing the Muslims in their drive to pacify the Christian Filipinos. Aguinaldo Flees to the Mountains.—With the assassination pf Luna, the bulk of the Filipino troops became demoralized, for Luna had some followers in the revolutionary camp. Not long after the bloody in cident, many army of ficers surrendered to the enemy, thus making it difficult for Aguinaldo to maintain his army in tact. General Otis, taking advantage of the confusion in the Filipino ranks, decided to trap Aguinaldo in Angeles, Pampanga. He sent battle-seasoned troops to Lingayen Gulf to cut off Aguinaldo’s retreat. At the same time, he or dered Mac- Arthur to force Aguinaldo to move north into the waiting arms of the American for ces. The American of fensive began on October 12. Aguinaldo, finding himself in a precarious situation, moved his capital to Tarlac. When the enemy advanced he moved his capital to Ba- yombong, Nueva Vizcaya. The Americans were now in the dark as to the whereabouts of Aguinaldo, who had in the mean¬ time transferred to Bayambang, Pangasinan. With the American for ces fanning out in a U directions to trap him, Aguinaldo decided to flee to the north. With his wife, son, mother, sister, and some members of the Cabinet, he boarded the train on the night of November 13 bound for Calasiao. The Americans followed him in hot pursuit, but Aguinaldo was determined not to be captured and marched through valleys, fields, rivers, and hillsides day and night, stopping only here and there for brief moments of rest. Once out of reach of the enemy, Aguinaldo, realizing the disadvantage of having women with them, decided to surrender them. On Christmas day, 1899, the women, escorted by some army of ficers, were surrendered to the American army. Mean¬ while, Aguinaldo, finally rid of the women, continued his march ( THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 225 to Tierra Virgen, Cagayan, and, on September 6, 1900, reached Palanan, Isabela. It was a place difficult to approach, for the terrain was mountainous and all points leading to the town were guarded by Aguinaldo’s loyal men. The Battle of Pasong Tirad.—In Aguinaldo’s flight to the north, his rear guard commander, General Gregorio del Pilar, noted the advantageous terrain of Pasong Tirad. He, the refore, suggested that in or der to halt the Americans temporarily he would stay behind and make a last stand at the Pass. He thought that such a battle would necessarily delay the Americans and give Aguinaldo, on the other hand, sufficient time to widen the distance between him and the pursuing enemy. Aguinaldo ap¬ proved Del Pilar’s suggestion with much regret, for the young Del Pilar, the “boy general” of the armed for ces, had been loyal to him. Pasong Tirad was 4,500 feet high and commanded a good view for miles around. The trail leading to it was so narrow that only one man at a time could clamber up the hill. Del Pilar or dered his sixty men to b uld trenches on both shoulders of ihe Pass where they could see the movement of the enemy below. At ten o'clock on the night of December 1, 1899, Aguinaldo received Del Pilar’s report that the Americans had arrived at the town of Concepcion. The Americans under Major Marcn pursued Aguinaldo re¬ lentlessly, fox only the capture of the wily Filipino leader could end Filipino resistance to American rule. In the morning of December 2, Mar^h pri needed with his men, about 300 strong against Pasong Tirad From atop the Pass, the Filipino defend¬ ers fired at the advancmg enemy, who had not so far pinpointed the exact position of tne Filipinos.

No sacrifice can be too great. v* The afternoon of the battle, Aguinaldo received the fatal news. All the members of the Aguinaldo party, said one of the soldiers in his diary, “shed bitter tears and all wanted to fight the Americans.” The Capture of Aguinaldo.—With the Philippine army bereft of its leader and symbol, many Filipino soldiers and of ficers found it convenient to surrender to the enemy. At the same time, the Americans conducted an in tensive campaign of pro¬ paganda to win over the Filipinos to their side. They used the members of the Filipino middle and upper classes — Cayetano Arellano, Pedro A. Patemo, Felipe Buencamino, Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, Benito Legarda, Gregorio Araneta, and others — to campaign for peaceful existence under the Americans. Duti¬ fully, the Filipino collaborators, tired of carnage and disturbance and wanting to continue their exalted position under the Amer¬ ican regime, appealed to the guerrillas to give up their arms and live peacefully under the blessings of America. Pardo de Tavera, in particular, founded the newspaper La Democracia whose policy was based on what he termed the “fraternal feelings which the President of the United States and the American people have to ward them” [ the Filipinos]. While the American peace of fensives were going on, Colonel Frederick Funston, stationed in Nueva Ecija, was planning the capture of Aguinaldo. His men had earlier accepted the surrender of Cecilio Segismundo, Aguinaldo’s messenger, and had decoded some letters of Aguinaldo to his field generals. Knowing that the road to Palanan was fraught with danger, Funston employed some Macabebes and two for mer of ficers in the Filipino army, Lazaro Segovia and Hilario Tal Placido, to help put his plan into execution. With the reluctant blessing of General Mac Arthur, Funston and his co-conspirators sailed to Palanan on the Amer¬ ican warship Vicksburg, Funston or dered the for ging of the signature of General Urbano Lacuna, to whom Aguinaldo wrote THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 227 4 an or der to send reinforcements to Palanan, and made it appear that Lacuna was sending the needed reinforcements to Aguinaldo. After days of hardships, Funston and his American companions, pretending to be captives of the Macabebes, arrived at Palanan on March 23, 1901. Aguinaldo and his men met the Filipinos joyfully and even gave them food and shelter. Without any warning, the Macabebes turned against their countrymen, and Tal Placido grabbed Aguinaldo from behind. The firing, however, unnerved Tal Placido, who promptly fell on his stomach. Segovia began firing like a mad man, and Colonel Simeon Villa, fearing for Aguinaldo’s life, shielded him from the bullets. Aguinaldo who had by now whipped his pistol, wanted to fight back, but Dr. Santiago Barcelona held him by the arms, saying: “My General, you owe it to our people to live and continue fighting for free¬ dom.” Funston and his American companions entered the room and arrested Aguinaldo in the name of the United States Govern¬ ment. He was brought to Manila and on April 1, he took his oath of allegiance to the United States. In a proclamation he issued on April 19, he appealed to all Filipinos to accept the “sovereignty of the United States... Barbarous Acts.—War has always been uncivilized, and al¬ though its weapons have vastly improved with the advance of science, its techniques have not changed radically from those of less civilized ages. In almost all cases, brutality as an in stru¬ ment to weaken an enemy’s resistance is practised on both sides of the fence. The Filipino-American war was not an exception, particularly because the combatants belonged to two different races and civilizations. In judging Filipino brutality, however, one must remember that the Filipinos, having been the victims of American apostasy and imperialistic designs disguised as “bene¬ volent” and “altruistic”, have little to answer for their behavior to wards the Americans, for they considered the latter not only as traitors to their cause, but also as in terlopers and an obstacle to their legitimate desire for freedom and in dependence. This is not to justify Filipino brutality committed as a defensive measure but simply to explain why the Filipinos had to be brutal to the Americans who came to the Philippines purportedly to help them win their in dependence from Spain, but who actually had imperialistic designs on their country. The sources for a knowledge of these brutalities came from Filipino participants and eye-witnesses and from the Americans the mselves who, in a moment of moral agony, divulged the de- 228 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE tails and particulars of American brutalities in letters to their parents and friends and in testimonies before American in vestigating bodies. When the American military found to their discomfiture that the Filipinos were a stubborn people, they resorted to ex¬ treme measures to soften the Filipinos’ will to fight.

The sources for a knowledge of these brutalities came from Filipino participants and eye-witnesses and from the Americans the mselves who, in a moment of moral agony, divulged the de- 228 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE tails and particulars of American brutalities in letters to their parents and friends and in testimonies before American in vestigating bodies. When the American military found to their discomfiture that the Filipinos were a stubborn people, they resorted to ex¬ treme measures to soften the Filipinos’ will to fight. Said an author^1 Some of them [Americans] resorted to to rtures the likes of which had not been witnessed in the Philippines before. The cruelty of some Americans came to the knowledge of the American public through articles and letters written by soldiers who had seen such brutalities perpetrated upon the Filipinos. One such article appeared in Philadelphia, January 2, 1902, alleging that the American soldiers and their stooges, the Macabebe scouts, used the “water cure” almost in variably to loosen the to ngues of the hapless Filipinos in or der to force them to reveal the movements, weapons, size, and methods of the guerrillas. The “cure” consisted in for cing a man to lie flat on his back, his mouth for ced open by a stick or bayonet and, in some in stances, a cartridge case. Then water, usually salty or dirty, was poured into his mouth until his stomach was distended. The water was then disgorged from the stomach by making a chak of it for the soldiers to sit on. The process was repeated until the victim shouted, “Hold, enough!” There was variety in the mode of to rture. Less common was the Tope cure\" in which a long piece of rope was wrapped around the neck and to rso of the victim. A stick wa? placed between the coils of rope and slowly twisted to give the effect of a garrote. Sometimes, beating up a victim was resorted to until he became blue in the face. Two American of ficers, Lt. Alva Perkins and Capt. George Brandle, were charged with and tried for “wilfully and cruelly causing six Filipinos to be hung by the neck for a period of ten seconds, causing them to suffer* bodily pains.” They were found gu^ty and reprimanded for their sadistic efforts. In their desperation, the American soldiers turned arsonists burning whole to wns in or der to force the guerrillas to the open. One ruch in famous case of extreme barbarity occurred in the town of Balangiga, Samar, in 1901-190?. Balangiga was a peaceful little port off the southern tip of Samar, but it was garrisoned by Americans who could not pinpoint the nerve-center 1 Teodoro A. \\r ncillo, Malolos: The Crisis of tfa: Republic (Quezon < ity, University of the Philippines, 1960), p. 587 ft. THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 229 of guerrilla activities in the town. Many American soldiers who garrisoned the town were veterans of the Boxer Rebellion and had participated in the capture of Peking. The American soldiers were busy one morning taking their breakfast when suddenly they were at tacked by Filipinos in their employ. The church bells rang, and soon about 180 Filipinos fell upon the Americans many of whom were killed in stantly. The other Americans who tried to escape were boloed tc death, while others were hacked from the nose to the throat. The news of the guerrilla at tack gave rise to pained cries throughout the United States and so President Theodore Roosevelt gave or ders to pacify Samar. Assigned to the task was General “Jake” Smith. “I want no prisoners,” he said firmly. “I wish you to km and burn; the more you bum and kill the better it will please me.” Forthwith he or dered that Samar be transformed into “a howling wilderness.” Orders were also issued to shoot down anybody capable of carry¬ ing arms. By “capable of carrying arms,” General Smith meant to in clude even boys ten years old, for the latter could carry rifles and swing bolos. In six months, Balangiga became “a howl¬ ing wilderness.” The barbarity with which General Smith sub¬ dued the people of Samar to uched the conscience of the American people. After the end of the bloody campaign, Smith was court- martialed and retired from the service. Another author, an American, said of American brutalities:2 Lieutenant Bissell Thomas of the 35 th Infantry was con¬ victed of striking prisoners, one of whom was lying on the ground and bleeding from the mouth. The of ficer was reprimanded and fined three hundred dollars. Just before Mr. Root took of fice, Robert Collins of the Associated Press was permitted to cable: “There has been, according to Otis himself and the personal knowl¬ edge of everyone here, a perfect orgy of looting and wanton de¬ struction of property.” Private Jones of the 11 th Cavalry wrote that his troop, upon encountering a wedding party, fired into the throng, killing the bride and two men, and wounding ahother woman and two children. A captain and lieutenant of the 27 th Regiment were tried for hanging six Filipinos by their necks for ten seconds, “causing them to suffer great, bodily pain.” After the words were changed to “ment al anguish”, the of ficers were found guilty and sentenced to reprimands. 2 Leon Wolff, Little Brown Brother (New York, Doubleday & Com¬ pany, Inc., 1961), pp. 306 ff. 230 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE In April the mayors of San Miguel and San Nicolas were beaten to death by rattan rods.

Kicking, slap¬ ping, spitting at the faces of American prisoners were common, the hatred of the Americans being such that the guerrillas for got or conveniently for got Aguinaldo’s in junctions regarding the good treatment to be accorded the prisoners. Thus the brutality of the conqueror or, as an old veteran of the Revolution called, the in terloper, was matched by Filipino brutality. End of the Resistance.—Though thousands of Filipino soldiers surrendered as a result of the American peace propaganda and their brutal treatment of captured guerrillas, some military com¬ manders refused to lay down their arms. General Miguel Malvar took over the leadership of the Filipino Government or what remained of it and harassed the Americans by his guerrilla tactics. In Samar, General Vicente Lukban resorted to ambushing Amer¬ ican soldiers and with drawing after killing and wounding them. Angered at this tactic, General Jacob Smith or dered the massacre of all men and children below ten years, with the result that the province became a “howling wilderness”. But the relentless 3 Agoncillo, op. cit., p. 587. THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN HOSTILITIES 231 campaign of the Americans led to the capture of Lukban on February 27, 1902. With his capture the resistance in Samar collapsed. Two months later, on April 16, General Malvar of Batangas surrendered to the enemy. The resistance movement now completely collapsed. It is true that some patriotic Filipinos, led by Macario Sakay, continued the resistance and even estab¬ lished a Tagalog “Republic” with headquarters in the Sierra Madre near Manila, but his resistance was not serious enough to endanger the American rule. The capture of Aguinaldo ended an era and, at the same time, opened another. Behind him, Aguinaldo left the ashes of a past that became embedded in the memory as the fanatical struggle of an enslaved people to win freedom and in dependence through blood and tears. sjc sjc j|c ^ 14 THE RELIGIOUS SCHISM The only living and tangible result of the Revolution was the Filipino Church, popularly known as the Aglipayan or Phil¬ ippine Independent Church. When at the start of the second phase of the Revolution the Spanish archbishop enlisted Father Gregorio Aglipay’s help in bringing back the Filipinos to the Spanish side, Aguinaldo persuaded Aglipay to divert his energies to the cause of the people. Mabini, riding on the crest of the popular nationalistic movement, suggested the founding of a Filipino National Church. Though unsuccessful owing to war conditions, his idea laid the groundwork of the later Philippine Independent Church. The story of the birth of this Church is to a great extent the story of the struggle of the Filipino clergy to Filipinize the Catholic Church in the Philippines. Gregorio Aglipay on the Scene.—The Revolution which began in 1896 was primarily a conflict of races. On the one hand were the Filipino civil and clerical groups who were up in arms against the Spanish civil and clerical segment, on the other. As it turned out, the second phase of the Revolution was not only political, but religiouc as well. The Philippine Catholic Church, whose majority belonged to the party of the oppressors, aided and abetted the colonial government in its policy of repression. Mabini himself, in his letter to General Otis in 1898, accused the Spanish friars of giving aid and comfort to the colonial administration and of taking up arms, when necessity arose, against the revolu¬ tion ists. In the circumstances, he refused to free the friar- prisoners. In the second phase of the Revolution, which commenced with Aguinaido’s return from Hongkong, Governor-General Basilio Augustin and Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda, know¬ ing that Father Gregorio Aglipay was still sympathetic to Spain but rather hostile to the United States, played a game in which Aglipay was the pawn. They commissioned him to confer with revolutionary leaders, particularly with Mariano Trias, Artemio Ricarte, and Emiliano Riego de Dios, in or der to bring them 232 THE RELIGIOUS SCHISM 233 back to the Spanish side. The bait to win them over to their side was the promise of autonomy. Aglipay diu as he was told, but his mission was a failure, for the revolutionary leaders had lost their faith in Spanish promises. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo, who had just returned from Hongkong, sent Colonel Luciano San Miguel as his emissary to Aglipay for the purpose of persuading the latter to work for the Filipino cause. Nozaleda countered by commissioning Aglipay to win over Aguinaldo to the Spanish cause. Aguinaldo, however, was firm in his determination to cooperate with the Americans and urged Aglipay to go to the north to work for the revolutionary cause. Nozaleda was well posted on these moves and, taking advantage of the situation, encouraged Aglipay to go north not to heed Aguinaldo’s prompt¬ ing, but to in vestigate the condition of the bishopric of Nueva Segovia. Aglipay to ured the northern provinces and secured the release of two Jesuit priests. Upon his return to Manila to report to Nozaleda, he found the city besieged on all sides. In the circumstances, he did the next best thing: he went to Cavite and joined Aguinaldo’s movement. At the in stance of Mabini, the Revolutionary Government recognized the validity of civil marriage on the assumption that the revolution had made the separation of Church and State a reality. By “State” Mabini meant, of course, the Revolutionary Government, not the colonial government"

At the in stance of Mabini, the Revolutionary Government recognized the validity of civil marriage on the assumption that the revolution had made the separation of Church and State a reality. By “State” Mabini meant, of course, the Revolutionary Government, not the colonial government. Moreover, the Re¬ volutionary Government, again at the in stance of Mabini, re¬ fused to recognized Nozaleda’s authority and went so far as to prohibit any Filipino priest from accepting any responsibility from the Catholic Church or from occupying vacant parishes with out the express approval of the Revolutionary Government. The circumstances, then, were propitious for the rebel government to win the full cooperation of the Filipino clergy. On October 20, 1898, Aguinaldo issued a decree ’appointing Aglipay Military Vicar General. This appointment made Aglipay the religious leader of the revolutionary movement. Nozaleda Against Aglipay.—Aglipay’s position in the Revo¬ lutionary Government as Military Vicar General and his position in the Catholic hierarchy as Ecclesiastical Governor of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia were anomalous. As a Filipino, he had to support the revolutionists, but as a Catholic priest he had to back up the head of the Church who, as a Spaniard, was naturally for the colonial government. Aglipay chose to be a Filipino first and a Catholic second. On October 21, a day after his appoint- 234 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ment as Military Vicar General, he issued a letter to the Filipino clergy urging them to or ganize the mselves into a cohesive body geared to the national emergency. The letter also urged the creation of a Cabildo or Council which would ask the Pope to appoint Filipinos in all Church positions from archbishop to the lowest parish priest. Realizing the chaotic condition into which the parishes had fallen owing to the capture of the Spanish friar- curates, Aglipay, on October 22, issued a manifesto asking the Filipino clergy to or ganize the mselves in such a way as to take charge of all vacant parishes. This appeal was made to prevent further deterioration of the religious affairs of the country. As Ecclesiastical Governor of Nueva Segovia, Aglipay urged the priests under his jurisdiction to rally to the revolutionary cause and to consolidate all the for ces favorable to the cause of the Filipino clergy. Nozaleda, deeply alarmed at Aglipay’s in creasing popularity and the consolidation of his position as a factor favorable to the Filipino clergy’s cause, decided to discipline the nationalistic Filipino priest. On April 29, 1899, Nozaleda charged Aglipay with usurpation of power and urged the Ecclesiastical Tribunal to punish the Filipino priest. With the blessings of the Tribunal, Nozaleda issued his decree excommunicating Aglipay. It was to take effect on May 5, 1899. The decree of excommunication declared Aglipay a usurper and a schismatic. In an age of ob¬ scurantism, excommunication was the most potent weapon of the prelates to force their enemies to their knees. It was ef¬ fective in Europe during the Middle Ages, and Nozaleda thought it would have the same effect on the Filipinos to ward the close of the nineteenth century. And why not? Governor-General Juan de Vargas (1678-1684), though punished with less than excommunication, was for ced to stand at the entrance of the Ma¬ nila churches for a period of four months wearing a sackcloth and a rope about his neck. The effect on the governor’s person was almost the same as if he were excommunicated: embarrass¬ ment and humiliation. And so the Manila archbishop thought he could humiliate Aglipay by excommunicating him. But he was mistaken. Aglipay was a man of strong character and in¬ stead of cowering before the Spanish prelate to ask for for give¬ ness, he returned the compliment by declaring Nozaleda ex¬ communicated. Furthermore, he charged Nozaleda with starv¬ ing the people and with collaborating with the Spaniards and the Americans in the latter’s policy of repression. Succeeding events proved that Nozaleda’s excommunication decree did not THE RELIGIOUS SCHISM 235 carry its usual weight with the people. Mabini and the National Church Apolinario Mabini, a Mason and an uncompromising nationalist, saw the necessity of having a church administered by Filipinos and owing its loyalty to the country. On October 22, 1899, while vacationing in Rosales, Pangasinan, Mabini directed a manifesto to the Filipino clergy urging them to or ganize a Filipino National Church. He said: Let the Filipino clergy show their zeal and love for the Church; let them show their capacity to govern not only the parishes but also the diocese; let them show that the regular or ders are not needed in the Philippines to maintain alive the faith in the Catholic religion, and the Pope who cannot separate from justice as a Vicar of Christ who is God has to recognize the rights and merits of the Filipino priests. This is the most opportune occasion which Divine Providence of fers them to obtain the reparation of their grievances: those who aspire to be something more than mere coadjutors and pages must not let this occasion pass. Mabini argued for the preservation of the Church, but its preservation must be predicated upon the appointment of Filipino clergy of all positions, high or low. The National Church as Mabini conceived it* was to cooperate with the Republic, the reby making the Filipinos completely united in their in dependence stand. The Filipino National Church.—Mabini’s call for a Filipino Church and the favorable at titude of the Republic to ward the Filipino clergy heartened the latter who believed that the time was ripe for the assertion of their rights not only to occupy the parishes, but also to direct Philippine Catholicism at the top"

That same night, however, lsabelo de los Reyes called a meeting of h? s Democratic Labor Union at the Centro de Bellrs Artes and delivered a severely anti-friar speech. He proposed the establishment of a Filipi. io Church in dependent of Rome with Aghpay as the Supreme Bishop. The proposal was enthusiastically approved. The. icw Church was called Iglesia Fiupina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church). With its founding, the schism with Rome commenced. First Converts—A man of passion and vision, lsabelo de los Reyes was nevertheless over-enthusiastic and pre ipitate. In his desire to give dignity to the movement, he placed in the list of the Executive Committee of the new Church such big names as Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, Fernando Ma. Guerrero, Mar¬ tin Ocampo, Manuel Artigas and other eminent lay leaders, and such priests as Adriano Garces, J. Barlin, Manuel Roxas, Toribio Dominguez, and others, with out consulting them. These men, though not hostile to the religious movement, were not prepared to lend their names to the new Church. Consequently, they denied any connection with it. The most fatal blow came from Aglipay himself who did not approve of the schism. He believed that all means should be exhausted to come to an understanding with Rome before taking any radical step. At that time, Aglipay was conferring with the Jesuits. 238 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE De los Reyes was naturally disappointed, although perhaps he had no one to blame but himself. Luck, as it were, was on his side. The masses understood the meaning of the new Church and came to his rescue. Some residents of Navotas, Rizal, sent in their affiliation papers. The ground was now broken and to ward the end of the year fourteen Filipino priests affiliated with the new Church. This was followed by the defection of Father Pedro Brilliantes of Ilocos Norte to the Filipino Church. His in fluence seeped through the priests of his province and in no time, they, too, joined the new Church. There was no stopping the movement now, and priests from all over the coun¬ try came rushing in to sign their names in the roster of the Filipino Church. Aglipay and the Jesuits.—Aglipay was mildly irked at the in clusion of his name as the Supreme Bishop of the new Church, for he was at the time in conference with the Jesuits in a last at tempt to prevent a schism. Knowing that Aglipay was in¬ fluential with the Filipino clergy, the Jesuits, through Dr. Le 6 n Ma. Guerrero and Joaqufti Luna, in vited Aglipay to an in terview at the Jesuit House in Sta. Ana, Manila. The Jesuits chose Father Francisco Foradada, a Spaniard and author of a book on the Philippines, to work on the Filipino priest. For four days, Foradada exerted all his power of persuasion to win back Aglipay to the Catholic fold, although Aglipay had not as yet definitely given up his Catholic faith. On the fifth day, Foradada handed Aglipay a document for his signature. The document, apparently, was a confession of Catholic faith, a return to Catholicism and, in a way, a retraction of what he had done. Aglipay studied the document and when Foradada returned in the afternoon he had not as yet signified his in tention of signing the document. Foradada promised that if he would sign it he would be appointed bishop or archbishop, with a large sum of money thrown in. Aglipay wanted an assurance that by signing the document the problem of the Filipino Catholic priests would be solved, which is to say, that the Filipino clergy would be appointed to the posts, for merly held by the Spanish regulars.* “With closed eyes,” said Aglipay, “I would sign this document, not for servile gallantry, but for consolidating the religious peace * This and the following account of another in cident are based on Aglipayan sources, particularly Manuel Lagasca’s Iglesia Filipina In- dependiente: Sn Origen, Signification e Importancia (Manila, 1939).

Can you guarantee at least that with the signing of this document the problem of the native priests will be solved?” Foradada, over-confident and over-bearing, replied: “Why do you mind so much the Filipino priests, since all the world knows that they are vicious and hopelessly in efficient?” Aglipay trembled with savage fury. He turned to the ar¬ rogant Spaniard. They were facing each other across a round table. Aglipay, in the heat of the moment, reached for Fora¬ dada but failed. He then lunged at him, held him by the nape of his neck, and shouted: “Either you with draw that odious calumny, Father Foradada, or at this moment I’ll for ever end all your slanderous impertinences.” The arrogant Spaniard, terrified at the Filipino’s wrath, fell on his knees, trembling and clasping his hands. Here, in deed, was a partial reenactment of the scene in the Noli wherein the in solent Fray D 4 maso, held by the occiput by Ibarra and on his knees not to pray but to await death by the blade, held even his breath for fear Ibarra might mistake it for his impertinent answer. The commotion that followed the angry fulminations of Aglipay at tracted Dr. Le 6 n Ma. Guerrero and Joaquin Luna to the room. Aglipay, thinking that Luna came to succor the embattled Jesuit, turned to him, saying: “Do not in tervene in his affair, for it is not your concern. Remember that the blood of your brother is still fresh in our fields. If that precious blood had been shed, if our Revolution took place, it was because of the system of spoliation practised by Rome, which drove our people to risk all perils and sacrifice to emancipate our land from monastic oppression. A so-called representative of Christ, this man, in stead of deploring the monstrous blunders of frailocracy, of which he is a member, still in sists in of fending in my face the sacred dignity of our race.” Turning to Foradada, who was still trembling, Aglipay blurted out: “Your provocative in sults took off the mask from your face! I am now convinced that the ecclesiastical authorities of Rome are in capable of dealing justly with the Filipinos. Now, I leave this building, and bear in mind that within three days you will hear from this Filipino priest named Aglipay.

This time the conference was to take place at Rogers’ house in Intramuros. Father Joaquin Villalonga was chosen to deal with Aglipay, who was accompanied by the young Aglipayan priest, Santiago Fonacier. Vilallonga was diplomatic and earnestly urged Aglipay to return to the Catholic fold and to for get the new Church. The Pope, he said, was in terested in avoiding a religious schism. “Furthermore,” he added, “anything you ask will be granted by His Holiness, on condition that you help bring to an end the schismatic movement you in itiated.” Expressing bis appreciation of Villalonga’s kind words, Aglipay answered: ‘As for me, I do not want anything, because it r enough for me to look at the mountains of my country to make me feel that I am the richest man in the world. I only ask justice and sincere love for my people. The Philippine In¬ dependent Church, of which I am the head, is spreading through¬ out th^ Archipelago and its object is no other than the reestablish¬ ment of the rational worship of the only one God in all His splendor, and at the same time to prove to the world the ability of the Filipinos to enjoy an in dependent religious life.” “Father Gregorio,” answered Vilallonga, “it reems impos¬ sible to me that in so short a time you have run a greater dis¬ tance than Savonarola, Luther, and Calvin along that perilous slope of heresy. I trust, nevertheless, that when you are finally Some students of Philippine history ’doubt the credibility of Lagasca but do not present procfs to impugn the credibility of his account. The in cidents her' narrated have not been disputed to date, and neither Fr. Vilallonga during his lifetime nor any scholar has so far denied the veracitv of the in cidents narrated herein. That Aglipay, as one student of history said, was rude and not exactly upright in his hfe is not denied, in the same manner that many oi the Spanish friars’ immoral actuations during more than three centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines cannot be disputed. But precisely because Aglipay was “rude” and “brash” is enough reason to believe that he was eminently capable of doing what he allegedly did to Fr. Foradada and Fr. Vilallonga.

Upon your decision depends the eternal salvation of millions of souls, since with the proposal I make the Mother Church has gone up to the maximum of possible grants.” “Please do not speak to me of salvation!” Aglipay exclaimed. “This problem is very debatable and much discussed, too, and to me it seems improper for serious people. You speak to me of grants, like those of fered to me by Father Foradada, your brother Jesuit. I seek not for my personal betterment. What I am after is justice and truth... ***Though you tempt me with mitres and millions, I am compelled by my conscience to refuse.” The conversation went on and on until Aglipay, saying that since Vilallonga wanted to help him, would he the refore give him a thousand pesos? “I have not that amount with me,” said the Jesuit. “What!” Aglipay exclaimed. “No sooner had I tried to verify the veracity of your reiterated desire to help me than you confess that you do not have one thousand pesos, an amount which is hardly enough for postage stamps necessary to in form the people of our Church of your proposition. Well, in or der to show that Aglipay loves you, too, ask me for any amount and I shall readily give it to you.” Father Vilallonga took the bait. “And if”, he said, “I ask for the moon?” “If you ask me the moon,” came the swift answer, “I would give it to you this very in stant in a silver tray!” “Impossible!” “It is stupid and silly to ask for the impossible, Father Vilallonga. If you ask the moon of me I would find it for you, since I consider you a judicious person. But in view of your complete and admitted worthlessness I am constrained to end this conversation. The Philippine Independent Church will go on, and neither the Pope nor all the Jesuits living now and here¬ after will be able to impede it.

The Filipino Independent Church was on its way to proselytize in its homeland — a Church that was free to develop as it saw fit with out any in terference from either the Pope or his representatives. Significance.^ Born of the Revolution, the movement for a Filipino National Church in dependent of Rome was a reaction of the nationalistic priests to centuries of disparagement and prejudice. The Spanish prejudice had two bases: first, the feel¬ ing of racial superiority, and second, the alleged in competence of the Filipino clergy. As to the first basis, the Spanish friars could not admit that the colored Filipinos were or could be the equal of the white Spaniards. As to the second basis, the Span¬ iards had some justification in thinking the Filipinos were in¬ competent, for doubtless the early Filipino clergy were not rig¬ or ously trained for their duties. But the Filipino secular clergy of the second half of the nineteenth century were well trained and had all the earmarks of efficiency and competence in reli¬ gious matters. Since the Spanish friars had a racial prejudice against the Filipinos, they considered the competence of the Filipino clergy purely mythical. In the circumstances, the Fili- THE RELIGIOUS SCHISM 243 pino clergy sided with the revolutionists not because they really sympathized with the latter, but because they found in the rev¬ olutionary movement a timely opportunity to succeed the Span¬ ish friars as wielders of power and authority. In other words, by joining the Revolution which they thought would be success¬ ful, the Filipino clergy wanted to take the place of the Spanish friars and so become powerful not only in religious, but also in political matters. The Spanish racial prejudice was so great that it was im¬ possible for the friars to overcome it. They considered the Fili¬ pinos in capable of learning and so in sisted on the perpetuation of the old regime under which the Filipino clergy remained their servants. Even in the face of military defeat, the friars could not bring the mselves to believe in the necessity of chang¬ ing the status quo. It is for this reason that many of them handled the Mausers and Remingtons when the tide of battle was going against the colonial government. They had to fight with out shedding off their cassocks, for they were fighting for the con¬ tinuance of their power and authority in Philippine society. It was this bull-headed refusal to accept the reality of changing conditions that was responsible for the alienation of the Filipino clergy from the Catholic Church in the Philippines. Aglipay exhausted all means to prevent a break with Rome, but the Church authorities tried to divide the Filipinos by courting, flattering, and at tempting to bribe Aglipay, the leader of the secessionist movement, in the fond belief that, as in the past, promises of honor and lucre would tempt the leader into be¬ traying the Filipino cause. Unfortunately for them, the na¬ tion alist movement had reached its apex and Aglipay, one of its mainstreams, was a man of in tegrity whose convictions were not for sale. The Revolution, then, had two results: first, the liquidation of the Spanish empire in the Orient, and second, the alienation of a segment of the population from the Catholic Church. What¬ ever the real motives of the Filipino clergy in joining hands with the revolutionists, the fact remains that the religious schism, which led to the establishment of the Filipino Independent Church, was the most important result of the Filipinos’ struggle for na¬ tion al emancipation. The Revolution started as a political up¬ heaval; it ended as a religious triumph. The founding of the Filipino Church showed, finally, that the Filipino clergy had at long last come of age. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * Part IV THE AMERICAN PERIOD 15 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) After the capture of General Emilio Aguinaldo at Palanan, Isabela in 1901, the Filipino-American War ended as far as the United States and Filipino elites were concerned. But to the Filipino masses, who looked upon their war against the Americans as a continuing struggle for in dependence, the resistance lasted longer. The resistance can be conveniently seen in three sectoral perspectives: Christian, Muslim, and tribal. A. The Katipunan Inertia As previously noted, the surrender of Aguinaldo only for mally ended the Aguinaldo-led resistance, but the in ertia of the Katipu¬ nan revolution that began from the Bonifacio-in itiated struggle continued to sustain the struggle for in dependence. In fact, despite the Aguinaldo capture, the remaining leaders of the Aguinaldo Army, particularly General Miguel Malvar in Batangas, General Vicente Lukban in Samar, and other army of ficers, continued the war in their respective areas. That the resistance was not dependent on the regular Filipino army was obvious from the revolutionary activities of Macario Sakay after the surrender of Lukban and Malvar. Sakay, who at tempted to put up his own Tagalog Republic with its own constitution, kept alive the struggle for in dependence even after he saw the lost cause of the Aguinaldo war against imperialism. Sakay was eventually persuaded by Dominador Gomez to yield but the masses who had looked up to him for the continuing resistance did not follow suit. 1.

In Luzon, 1905 Resistance was reported by the American authorities con¬ fidentially and publicly in the strategic areas of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. In Luzon in 1905, disturbances were reported in Cavite and Batangas. Governor Shanks of Cavite noted outbreaks at San Pedro Tunasan, Paranaque, Taal, and San Francisco de Malabon. The leaders of the uprisings were for mer of ficers of the revolutionary army who were respected by the people. The 247 248 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE conditions in the province had created the new leaders of the resistance movement. By 1907, the mystification of the resistance had expressed itself in a strong mass movement led by Salvador Felipe whose cause would be popularly known as the Santa Iglesia movement, which means literally crusade of the “Holy Church”. “Apo Ipe,” as Salvador was popularly known to the in timates of the movement, saw his cause spread to Bulacan, Pampanga, and even beyond to Tarlac and Nueva Ecija so that the weakening of the movement by 1910 might have found some kind of mass in ertia against the colonial authorities in a shortlived outbreak in Nueva Ecija led by Simeon Mandac. Thereafter, no significant outbreaks were noted by the colonial authorities especially after the change in American administration from Re¬ publican to Democratic in 1912. The policy of rapid Filipiniza- tion in itiated by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison in 1913 must have contributed to the Filipino elite’s successful campaign to win the Filipino masses to the parliamentary struggle for self-government which was encouraged by the American government. 2. In Bicol, 1902 In the Bicol Peninsula and the Visayas, the pattern of resistance showed a radical shift from the elite to the masses. One of the movements that worried the Am? ricans was the one led by Simeon Ola and about 1,500 “in surrectos” in Albay. As a charismatic local leader, Ola started his activities after the fall of Aguinaldo. No less than Col. Harry H. Bandholtz noted the significant role of °la in the anti-colonial resistance in Bicol, although he regarded Ola as nothing but a notorious ladron. The American answer to Ola’s movement was a reconcentra¬ tion system in March 1903 which continued up to October. The effect was telling on the people who were brought into the re¬ concentration area. Food and accommodation were in adequate and deplorable. Diseases took their death toll and sufferings continued. Although no statistical record was kept of the extent of the damage to the people, the scanty reports that came from private sources and field correspondents of the U. S. Senate in¬ dicated the in numerable deaths in flicted on the helpless by the system. The method worked effectively for American purposes. About 300,000 was the estimated to tal casualties of the re¬ concentration system. But Governor Taft justified the method because a “reign of terror” had been in augurated by Ola in the province and other areas. 249 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901 1913) Negotiations were in itiated by the authorities to persuade Ola and his men to surrender. Vice Governor Luke Wright and Dr. Pardo de Tavera went to Albay to appeal to the people to help bring Ola to surrender to avoid deployment of the U. S. Army. Many conferences and promises were made and after forty days of tedious negotiations, Ola suspended the negotiations and with drew his for ces. He also took along a number of new recruits for his movement whom he had gained during the cessation of hostilities. On September 22, 1903, Colonel Bandholtz signed an agreement with Ola promising the latter immunity and “other things”. Later, the authorities denied promising Ola anything. They propagated the view that Ola finally surrendered in late October because he felt it was better than the prospect of con¬ fronting the U. S. troops that would be or dered to get him and his men. Reportedly, he was joined in his surrender by about 500 to 600 of his followers. Ola turned state witness against those who had joined him. This was the view spread out by the authorities. Accordingly, in return for his cooperation, Ola obtained executive clemency in line with the judicial practice in the West. In November the trial of the accused began with Judge James Blount and Judge Adam C. Carson presiding. They were assisted by Chief Prosecutor James Ross. Several of Ola’s men were freed. Some were sentenced under the Vagrancy Law while others were tried under the Sedition Law of 1901. The more serious cases were disposed of under the Brigandage Act which carried the death penalty. As for Ola, he was given in stead thirty years in prison for turning state witness. 3. In the Visayas, 1902 Other areas that presented a serious challenge to American colonial capacity were Samar and Leyte. The outbreak of dis¬ turbances was particularly irksome after the surrender of General Lukban in Samar in 1902. It continued up to the end of 1906. The in ertia of the revolutionary struggle did not end with Lukban’s capitulation. As noted by the Americans, Samar saw during this time the appearance of numerous bands with diverse purposes. Some were preying on people with cattle, properties, and things just as others were continuing the political unrest. These “jet¬ sams” and “flotsams,” as the Americans called them, were profes¬ sional in their work. They created the popular image of liberators and benefactors of the oppressed and the poor. Raids were conducted by roving bands. Brig. Gen. William H. Carter reported 250 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE in 1905 that a large proportion of the people had abandoned their homes and fields to join the bands. One of the serious in cidents took place on July 10, 1904 and was known as the “Tauiran Affair”. It was a raid by one of the bands on the village of Tauiran in the town of Gandara"

One of the serious in cidents took place on July 10, 1904 and was known as the “Tauiran Affair”. It was a raid by one of the bands on the village of Tauiran in the town of Gandara. One hundred houses were burned and 21 people killed. This was followed by the “Cantaguic Affair” in which the police lieutenant of the town and others were killed. After the killing, the raiders under their leader, Juliano Caducoy, proceeded to the tribunal or town hall where the local teniente was seized and around his head the American flag was tied. Kerosene was poured on him and he was taken out into the public square. Here the raiders burned the flag and the teniente. Caducoy warned the people that the same fate awaited those who served the flag. Then the raiders cut off the teniente’s lips, burned the barrio and took away, fifty captives. The teniente later died. Caducoy was subsequently captured and hanged. It should be noted that several to wns had the same fate as Tauiran and Cantaguic. Thirteen to wns in Gandara, eleven in Catbalogan, seven in Wright, three in Catubig, eight in Borongan, seven in Taft, and three in Llorente were put to the to rch by the pulahanes the name given to the in surrectors. The disturbances in Samar were followed in 1905 by similar outbreaks in Negros, Panay, Cebu, and Leyte. When Vice-Governor Henry C. Ide became Acting Governor General on November 4, 1905, he or dered Governor Curry of Samar to solve the problem. Curry admitted that by 1906 the situation had not been changed and thousands of people had joined the pulahan movement. He began negotiations for surrender. After several weeks, reported Col. Walace Taylor, Curry and the pulahanes reached an agreement in which the latter were to yield on March 24, 1906. Instead of surrender, 30 pulahanes under Nasario Aguilar at tacked the Consta¬ bulary garrison of 50 men. In hand to hand combat, 35 pulahanes died in the garrison and 8 more outside. On the colonial side, 22 were killed, 7 were wounded, in cluding Captain Jones and Lieu¬ tenant Bowers. As a result of the “Magtaon in cident*” an in quiry revealed that the pulahanes suspected bad faith when they saw present certain native of ficials and natives they hated in the supposed surrender. The authorities deployed 7 companies of native scouts and 4 companies of American troops under Colonel Smith of the 8 th Infantry to the Samar campaigns. This was in addition to the 21 st U. S. Infantry. 251 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) In Leyte, the anti-American disturbances began in June 1906. It was reported that Jaime de Veyra, Governor of Leyte, might have given encouragement, being known to be one of “the most obnoxious anti-Americans” in the archipelago. In one of the engagements, 450 natives confronted the Constabulary and the 21 st Infantry. In the encounter, 59 of the in surrectos died. / Why the Filipinos had not abandoned the armed resistance to American rule, notwithstanding the American declaration that peace had been established by 1907, was due to the continuing racial hatred that existed between the Filipinos and the Amer¬ icans. Governor James Smith admitted in his 1909 report: “an era of ill feeling has started between Americans and Filipinos and I hesitate to say it, race hatred.” 4. In Mindanao, 1903 Armed disturbances, which assumed the nature of anti-colonial resistance, were also noted in Mindanao. In March 1903, this kind of situation was recorded in Surigao. Civil Governor William Howard Taft reported that a group of “outlaws” entered the town of Surigao on March 23 and at tacked the Constabulary station which was under the charge of Captain Clark. The Captain was killed arid the guns of the detachment were carted away by the at tackers. The group tarried about the town before departing to their mountain hideouts. The seven American women of the town were able to avoid being killed when they were gathered by Mr. Luther S. Kelly, the provincial treasurer, into a government stonehouse. Kelly, the Indian scout of Yellowstone, held the at tackers at bay until reinforcement arrived. Governor Taft was criticized for his casual treatment of the in cident and for the sad state of the Constabulary as a force entrusted with the in ternal security of the town. As a step to neutralize this criticism, Taft or dered the army to retrieve the 75 or more guns taken by the band. Those who were captured were tried by District Judge, James Blount, for about a month, during which time he was protected by 703 soldiers under Colonel Meyer of the 11 th Infantry. The murderers of Clark were hanged and President Theodore Roosevelt commended Kelly for his heroic deed. Another violent affair was reported in Misamis in May 1903 and lasted until late in the year. The disturbances were different HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ifcf M from the Surigao in cident because the Misamis elements were real “in surrectos,” part of the revolutionary resistance in the country against American rule. They were not bandits or “cut¬ throats,” as admitted by the American authorities. Although not as widespread as the revolutionary resistance in Luzon or Visayas, the Misamis in surrectos had the respect and support of the people because their aim was to resist the colonial government in the region. B. The Muslim Struggle Even before the fall of Aguinaldo, sporadic clashes between Muslims and American troops started in Moroland. It was part of American colonial policy not to provoke the Muslims to violent reaction while the American war against Aguinaldo’s armed for ces was going on. The signing of the Bates Treaty on August 20, 1899 was part of this colonial strategy to neutralize the Sulu Muslims who were spoiling for battle against the Americans"

It was part of American colonial policy not to provoke the Muslims to violent reaction while the American war against Aguinaldo’s armed for ces was going on. The signing of the Bates Treaty on August 20, 1899 was part of this colonial strategy to neutralize the Sulu Muslims who were spoiling for battle against the Americans. By 1902, the Americans had reduced the Filipino resistance to small guerrilla-type at tacks on American stations. This allowed American at tention to be focused on the “Moro Problem”. But American imperialist approach to the Muslim problem, while anchored on a decisive millitary response, in cluded a subtle use of non-military means to create a positive impression of American in tention. Thus, in 1903, the “Moro Province” was or ganized to reconstitute the administrative processes in Mindanao in or der to show democracy at work but with American control remaining dominant. A year after, in 1904, with the successful in auguration of the Moro Province with Gen. Leonardo Wood as its first governor, the Bates Treaty was unilaterally abrogated by the United States. While the reason for abrogation given by the authorities, in cluding President William H. Taft, was the failure or in effectiveness of the Sultan to control the Moros. the actual reason was the need to cut at the outset any political postur¬ ing or leverage the Sultanate had acquired against American sovereignty or supremacy under the Bates Treaty. In this regard, Taft said that with the abrogation of the treaty, the Sultanate was left with no other option but to resist the imperialist deter¬ mination to emasculate the Sultan and, consequently, to destroy the political hold of the Sultanate over its subjects. The armed resistance after 1903 had acquired an ominous nature and pattern in the archipelago and, in a sense, would have some relation to the Muslim resistance in Lanao and Cotabato. Thus, the Muslim 253 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) armed response to imperialism can be classified into the ethno- geographic areas where it occurred: Lanao, Co tab ato, and Sulu. 1. The Lanao Resistance, 1902-1912. Despite American efforts to neutralize the Maranao leadership, only a part of it was amenable to accepting American sovereignty. The other part that continued the “Moro resistance” to colonialism was represented by traditional leaders like Sajiduciman, Ampuanagus, and Datu Grande. In June 1902, Datu Tungul of Onayan at tacked Camp Vicars. The Sultan of Binidayan was suspected by Amer¬ ican authorities as being in volved in the Tungul affair. He was arrested, but ran amuck when he failed to convince the Americans of his in nocence. His death triggered unrest among the Lanao Muslims. In Maciu, 150 to 200 Muslims, led by Sultan Ganduli and Sultan Tanagan, fought furiously against the Americans. Only three Muslims escaped and one American soldier was serious¬ ly wounded. In Taraca, in May 1903, John Pershing started his campaign against the Lake Moros. Although there were datus who co¬ operated, Datu Ampuanagus eluded American troops, but in one engagement at Pitacus, 13 Muslims were wounded, 23 were captured, and 90 were killed. Ampuanagus, with over 200 follow¬ ers, took a last stand at his Taraca fort. The American assault resulted in the destruction of the fort, with 200 defenders killed and 29 captured, in cluding Ampuanagus. In 1906, he again defied the Americans. Troops from Camp Keithley were sent in pursuit of Ampuanagus, but they were ambushed. Only three of the troops and a Muslim guide were wounded. Again troops were fielded to Ramain where Ampuanagus was reported hiding. There were clashes but no reported casualties. Finally, in June 1907, military contingents engaged Ampuanagus and his band at Didaganan, in flicting heavy casualties on the latter. In 1908, he at tacked Dansalan with 20 rifles and harrassed government troops in surrounding areas. Finally, peace negotiations led to Ampuanagus surrender, thus ending the resistance of one of the most elusive Lanao rebel leaders during the early American decade. With the neutralization of Ampuanagus’ resistance, the Lanao problem had virtually been solved. There were no significant encounters or battles after Ampuanagus. The other Lanao datus and sultans had earlier accepted the American peace overture and of fer of political partnership in local administration. 254 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE C. The Sulu Resistance, 1899-1913 1. The Bates Treaty, 1899 After the cession of the Philippines by Spair to the United States in 1898, the Sulu Muslims, like the rest of the Filipinos, had remained unreconciled to colonial rule. The serious conflict between Sulu and Spain in late 19 th century had not resulted in the weakening of Muslim will to remain free. But the United States was determined to enforce its so-called sovereignty over all of Moroland. The problem was. how to contain for a while Muslim resistance while American for ces were busy eliminating the Filipino obstacle in Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the Bates Treaty was concluded with the Sulu Sultanate, the first such for mal agreement entered into by the United States with the Muslims. As already in timated, the American government had no in tention of recognizing Muslim sovereignty in Moroland. The Muslims were aware of this American design. That is why the Bates Treaty was not binding on those who continued to resist, especially those who opposed the Sultan. There was Datu Julkanain and Datu Kalbi of Patikul who refused to join the Sultan. Then Panglima Hassan defied American threat when he showed non-compliance with the American demand of at least nominal recognition. The “Hassan Uprising” disrupted the stability of the Moro Province rule in Sulu. The Americans used the rebellion to discredit the Sultanate and to abrogate the Bates Treaty"

      "context": ". The Bates Treaty, 1899 After the cession of the Philippines by Spair to the United States in 1898, the Sulu Muslims, like the rest of the Filipinos, had remained unreconciled to colonial rule. The serious conflict between Sulu and Spain in late 19 th century had not resulted in the weakening of Muslim will to remain free. But the United States was determined to enforce its so-called sovereignty over all of Moroland. The problem was. how to contain for a while Muslim resistance while American for ces were busy eliminating the Filipino obstacle in Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the Bates Treaty was concluded with the Sulu Sultanate, the first such for mal agreement entered into by the United States with the Muslims. As already in timated, the American government had no in tention of recognizing Muslim sovereignty in Moroland. The Muslims were aware of this American design. That is why the Bates Treaty was not binding on those who continued to resist, especially those who opposed the Sultan. There was Datu Julkanain and Datu Kalbi of Patikul who refused to join the Sultan. Then Panglima Hassan defied American threat when he showed non-compliance with the American demand of at least nominal recognition. The “Hassan Uprising” disrupted the stability of the Moro Province rule in Sulu. The Americans used the rebellion to discredit the Sultanate and to abrogate the Bates Treaty. What followed was American relentless campaigns against Panglima Hassan from 1903 to 1905, in volving no less than the personal participation of Gov. Leonard Wood, veteran general and commander of the “Rough Riders” in the Cuban War. 2. Panglima Hassan, 1903 Wood’s campaign against Hassan in cluded a secret landing through siity walking unnoticed through jungles and swamps before the croops finally cornered Hassan and his followers. Hassan was captured by Col. Hughes Scott and was to be taken to Jolo for in carceration when the wily Hassan deceived Scott into stopping at one of Hassan’s hideout, supposedly to pick up Has¬ san’s wife. Hassan escaped at the first chance and eluded at tempts to get him, dead or alive. For some time the Hassan problem remained for as long as the Panglima was at large. Governor Wood used every possible contact, in cluding the Sultan and datus hostile to the fugitives. The patient in telligence work by Moro in- 255 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) for mers finally brought confirmed reports of Hassan’s location in the crater of Bud Bagsak. Wood or dered troops to move before sun¬ rise the next day. By dawn the columns of troopers had positioned the mselves on the slopes of Mount Bagsak. Before long Hassan and two other companions emerged from the crater where they had hidden for their morning personal routine. They were spotted by American sharpshooters who felled two of Hassan’s com¬ panions. But Hassan was unhurt and immediately slipped back to his hideout. Meanwhile the encircling troops in ched their way until all possible exits of Hassan were sealed. Then, a sergeant suddenly met Hassan who was trying to crawl out from the crater. The sergeant positioned himself with a calvin to put an end to the Hassan episode. Realizing the in evitable moment had come and possibilities of another escape was nil, Hassan took his “barung” — the weapon he had perfectly mastered since he saw the first glimpse of conflict. He plunged at the soldier who tried to get at him, but the bullets from the sergeant’s calvin finally ended the career of Sulu’s most colorful leader from the masses. When Hassan’s body was examined, there were twenty-six bullet wounds sustained from several encounters. Hassan’s death did no!; end the Sulu resistance. Others were in spired to follow the Panglima’s exploits. One of these was the renegade Pala who had just returned from an adventure in Borneo where authorities had been looking for him after a series of murderous robberies associated with him. He or ganized his own rebel band and defied American rule from 1905-1906. But like the earlier leaders, Pala was eliminated and his band destroyed. Besides Pala, there were other local leaders who created problems for American authorities in Jolo island where the Tausug resistance was concentrated. Prominent were Datu Usap, Paruka Utik, Salip Masdal, Maharaja Untung, Jikiri, and Nakib Amir. They were responsible for making the first American decade in Sulu a time of trial for American will and capacity. They were all suppressed with the help of some Tausug leaders, the Sultan, Julius Shuck, and their allies. While the suppression of the isolated revolts was accomplished by superior American arms, the next decade saw the emergence of armed conflicts. The most signif¬ icant were the “Bud' Bagsak Affair” in 1913 and the “Jikiri Threat” in 1909. 256 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 3. Bud Dqjo, 1906 In 1906, shortly after the suppression of the Pala Uprising, another trouble was brewing as hundreds of Muslims trekked to wards the crater of an extinct volcano, Bud Dajo, located strategically in the northern series of mountain ranges which had figured prominently in past encounters. The uneasiness was caused by a rumor that American in tention was to wipe out the Jolo Muslims. Thus, the trek to Bud Dajo was to become a heroic stand against American rule. Although the American authorities denied the truth of the rumor, it was too late to turn back the tide of a popular feeling that was aggravated by worsening social and economic problems. To confront the Muslims was a relatively small contingent of American troops composed of 65 men from the 6 th Infantry, 65 men from the 4 th Cavalry, and 130 soldiers from the 28 th Mountain Battery. Bud Dajo was for midable and strategic. Three small tracks, two feet wide, led to the crater measuring about 15 acres. The crater had abundant fresh water and was stocked with food resources. Governor Leonard Wood, who was dealing personally with the problem, admitted that the campaign was difficult because of the natural difficulties created by the geographic character of the area. Muslim barricades of not more than 8 feet along lava ridges and steep precipices would make “fall offs” land on top of trees below. Wood’s strategy was, the refore, to avoid such a hazardous operation by appealing to the defenders to surrender while at the same time preparing the military force. Governor Wood took immediate steps in line with the strategy. Col. Hugh W. Scott of the Zamboanga Constabulary and Captain John White were or dered to proceed to Jolo with 50 men. Then prominent leaders of Patikul were tapped as peace emissaries — Datu Kalbi, Datu Julkanain, and Panglima Bandahala. For two days the emissaries tried to persuade the defenders to abandon their resistance. On the third day the emissaries returned to Jolo to report the sad news of their futile mission. Sulu Governor Scott or dered the immediate assault on Dajo. The battle began on March 5, 1906 and lasted up to the morning of March 8"

Sulu Governor Scott or dered the immediate assault on Dajo. The battle began on March 5, 1906 and lasted up to the morning of March 8. Colonel Duncan was placed in command of the entire operation. Governor Wood gave a last chance for non-combatants to be evacuated but the latter refused. They would rather join their men. The assault was aided by artillery shelling which effectively neutralized Muslim capacity to in flict damage on American troops. Thus, 257 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) the Muslims tried to retaliate by feigning as corpses and jumping at the Americans with their krises and barungs when they came at striking distance. Although the stand was hopeless and the battle one-sided, the Muslims wanted to die with at least an enemy at their side. This kind of fanatical resistance amidst fatal hopelessness brought honors to colonial troops and earned for the “Moros” their savage image in American history. Amer¬ ican casualties from the D^jo battle were 18 killed and 52 wounded, while 600 Muslim recalcitrants in the crater were literally wiped out by mortar and machine gun fires from 800 troopers, Although the field of ficers deplored the one-sided fight, Governor Wood commended the troops for the successful campaigns and criticized the Sultan for the latter’s failure to assist. In the United States, the at tacks on Wood for the massacre were vicious and effective. On April 16, 1906 Wood held his last conciliatory conference with datus and local leaders before turning over the governorship of the Moro Province to Gen. Tasker H. Bliss. The effect of the Dajo massacre on the Filipino in depend¬ ence movement was to blunt the Filipino parliamentary struggle in the United States where the anti-in dependence for ces in Con¬ gress tried to blow up the Muslim at titude to American rule as an evidence of lack of preparedness for self-government. 4. Jikiri, 1907 7 » Jikiri, a native of Jolo, began his “piratical” at tacks on trading vessels or villages early in the American period but he became notorious and known to media about 1907. By then his activities had gone beyond Jolo to Basilan, the Zamboanga peninsula, and southeast to the Tawi-Tawi islands. After 1907, he had established a staging point in Cabingaan island between the Jolo and Siasi island groups. From pooled data, Jikiri’s notoriety was based not only on the killings of victims and the carting away of anything of value but also on his obssession to get beautiful women for his booty. Colonial assessment at tributed Jikiri’s obssession for beautiful maidens to some psychological problems caused or heightened by ugly facial features nature had given him since birth. Thus, Jikiri’s at titude to women was a psychological at tempt at com¬ pensation for personal satisfaction. After a long and tedious pursuit, with the assistance of local 258 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE leaders in cluding the Sultan, reliable in telligence data were gathered by Julius Schucks’ people on the hideout of Jikiri at Patian island. American troops and Tausug allies took off secretly for Patian and cornered Jikiri and his band, which in cluded his wife. Jikiri was finally killed after a hand to hand combat liquidated the rest of his band. With the death of Jikiri an irritating era of “piracy” came to an end and once again American rule had proven its successful campaign against recalcitants in Sulu. The year 1909 marked the beginning of political change from the Tasker Bliss to the John Pershing approach to the government or the affairs of the Moro Province. Having proven himself earlier in the Lanao campaigns, Gen. Pershing assumed the governorship of the Moro Province and started a vigorous “disarmament cam¬ paign” in Jolo, in addition to the educational assault on certain cultural values and practices such as polygamy, pilgrimage to Mecca, etc. The result was the revival of resistance which found tangible expression in the “Battle of Bud Bagsak” in 1913. i /» 5. Bud Bagsak, 1913 Records show that by June 1912, loose firearms had been collected in Jolo, except in Lati and Luuk where the opposition to disarmament was strong. Here began the process for another uprising when Panglima Indanan, a powerful leader, was arrested and disarmed, to gether with his aides and sons. This was ac¬ companied by the violent operations of the Scouts in the Eastern part of the Jolo, especially in Lati where the sabilallah at tacks on American troops became the source of colonial horror. More military pressures were exerted on the Lati people but the latter defied the odds and took their stand at Bud Bagsak. The entire population practically joined the rebellion. The number of defiant rebels was about 6,000 to 10,000, which in cluded about 10 per cent combatants and warriors. It appeared that the whole Lati community was defiant against American rule under circum¬ stances where the killings of non-combatants was a grim reality. The American authorities appealed for non-combatants and combatants to return to their abandoned farms and homes. Finally, many of the non-combatants were persuaded to avoid conflict and only the warriors remained determined to fight the colonial for ces. Part of the compromise was the with drawal of American troops from Jolo island. But peace was uncertain because the Lati Muslims had kept 259 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) the mselves in readiness to move to Bagsak in case of any troop movement. Gen. Pershing tried to convince them that American in tention was not to resort to final use of arms but rather to persuade them to surrender their arms for the sake of peace. The reaction to Pershing’s appeal was a defiant resolve to resist any effort to disarm them"

The reaction to Pershing’s appeal was a defiant resolve to resist any effort to disarm them. Convinced that all efforts would be futile, American strategy was to separate the non-combatants from the combatants. When this was achieved, Pershing or dered immediate troop movements to Bagsak which was reached by June 11, 1913. The defenders of the movement were surprised by American breach of the agreement. The resistance against Amer¬ ican arms was furious and heroic. But it was tragic and senseless because the massacre of Muslim freedom fighters by Americans was one sided and quick. Governor Pershing tried to justify the slaughter of ill-equipped and hopeless defenders by referring to them as “notorious cattle thieves and murderers” in the island whose liquidation was welcomed by the “entire population of the Sulu Archipelago”. For the colonial government, the Bud Bagsak affair ended with pax Americana dawning in Sulu as over 500 rifles were gathered from the island. But undoubtedly, as sub¬ sequent events would show, the Tausug will to resist and the love for liberty had remained unsubdued. D. The Cotabato Resistance, 1903-1912 1. Datu Ali, 1903 Unlike in Sulu and Lanao, there were only two significant events that marked Maguindanao’s resistance to American rule. One was in 1903 when Datu Ali, successor to Datu Utu’s mantle and son-in-law of Datu Piang, began to defy American of fer of peace and to persuade the Maranaos to join the anti-colonial movement. The military governor of Cotabato, Capt. Carl Riech- man, sent troops to the Rio Grande to prevent the spread of the uprising from Cotabato. The troops were in tercepted by Ali’s for ces between Kudarangan and Seneraya. Several of Ali’s follow¬ ers were killed. In March of 1903, American troops shelled Ali’s fort killing many of the defenders. Ali changed tactics from the traditional method of confronting the enemy to the guerrilla-type of engagement. Added to this was the use of sabilallahs to harass the Americans during the day while Ali’s warriors at tacked Amer¬ ican troop encampments in the evening. Ali’s defiance continued for almost three years. It was not until March 1906 that American troops finally 260 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE closed in on Ali. His fort in Serenaya was assaulted, killing several Muslims and capturing Datu Djimbangan, Ali’s brother. Arms and weapons were seized and Djimbangan was held hostage to force Ali to surrender. But Ali refused and was encouraged by support from several datus. But the prospect of success was neutralized by the collaboration of Datu Piang with American authorities. Piang did not support his son-in-law. In fact, Piang provided American troops with in for mation and other assistance. Finally, on October 22, 1906 Ali was cornered by troops under Frank Mc Coy while resting outside a hut in Simpetan. On October 31, thirteen of Ali’s followers were killed, in cluding him and three of his sons. 2. Datu Alamada, 1912 However, Ali’s death did not end Maguindanao’s defiance of American rule. In 1912 Datu Alamada and 300 followers rose in rebellion, supported by thousands of sympathizers who vowed not to accept American sovereignty. His movements were con¬ centrated in Buldon and Upper Cotabato. Late in 1912 local collaborators, led by Datu Inuk, of fered two plans to assist in the apprehension or killing of Alamada. The first plan was to in filtrate Alamada’s group and kill him. The second option was for Datu Piang and him to persuade Alamada to surrender and then, liquidate Alamada’s band. The government opted for direct negotiations. The negotiations were led by American and Filipino of ficials. They finally convinced Alamada to yield by of fering to resettle him and his people in a colony near Pikit. But; he opted to surrender to a Filipino rather than to an American of ficial. There were othe r Muslim disturbances in the Muslim south. But they were no longer as or ganized and sustained by popular support as in the first decade of American rule. The disturbances were either isolated, personal or small group encounters staged by recalcitrants from the Muslim masses. Many of the elites or aatus who spearheaded the anti-colonial struggle had been neutralized as a sector by military pressure and divide and rule tactics. Consequently, many of the in cidence of violence recorded in volved in ter-Muslim conflicts which the Americans allowed and even encouraged to destroy Muslim capacity to resist.

But like the rest of the earlier violence, the in cidents were neutralized. E. The Highlander’s Reaction a. Back to Tradition In the late 19 th century, the tribal groups had, to a certain extent joined the revolutionary movement against colonialism. Al¬ though the yivere not in tegrated into the Aguinaldo government and armed for ces, they nevertheless opposed the Spanish elements quite of ten because of what they perceived to be a definite Spanish effort to subdue them and to change their way of life. In Luzon, this type of reaction was represented by the Igorot armed struggle until the end of Spanish rule. In Mindanao, the Manobos joined the Muslim response to Spanish foothold by providing assistance to political leaders in need of support. But the American entry into the archipelago neutralized whatever violent reaction the tribal groups had against colonial rule. The tribal communities either continued to recoil further into the safety of in accessible sanctuaries or they accepted the conciliatory approach of American rule which made effective use of schools, churches, and medical services to win tribal con¬ fidence and friendship. The tribal communities in Luzon were won over by American Episcopal missionaries, and later, by medical missions and schools. The same was true in the Visayas, particulary in Negros and Iloilo, where Presbyterian missions contributed to health and sanitation and education at the grassroots level. Eventually, the conciliatory and humanitarian work produced a core of native collaborators who gradually assumed the work of reaching out to their own people with* just general supervisory control from the colonial of ficials. In the Mindanao area, the work of pacification was also undertaken by American laymen, enterpreneurs, and teachers, particularly during the period of the Moro Province from 1903 to 1906. The Lunds and Lamassons in the Subanun country of Zamboanga opened the socio-economic potentials of the area. Coconuts were in troduced in Lapuyan and other areas to improve agricultural in come. But perhaps, more effective were the efforts 295 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) of American capitalists and planters who started to explore the commerical and trade potentials of Mindanao, especially in Davao and Cotabato. The general effect of these socio-economic activi¬ ties was to neutralize any resistance to colonial rule. b. The Subanun Affair, 1909 The only violent disturbance reported in Mindanao was in 1909 among the Subanons. The Constabulary report from the Fifth District to the headquarters in Zamboanga referred to a “fight” on November 28 at the sitio of Bobhoran between govern¬ ment for ces under Capt. H. H. Elarth and about eight to nine hundred Subanuns and Moros. Before the encounter, the headman of Bobhoran reported on November 1 that thousands of Subanuns were leaving their homes and farms and were heading to wards the mountains of Dapeok and Malindang on the “call of two boy prophets” who told them that the end of the world was coming. He declared that the sea would cover all the lands except the highest peaks and all who would not seek refuge in the sacred mountains would drown and die. The people were advised not to take along any possession except what they needed for their journey to the mountains from where they would be taken to heaven. The authorities were alarmed by the abandonment of homes, properties, and farms as it might just be one of the tricks of bad elements to deprive the Subanuns of their valuables and harvests. The headman was or dered to stop the movement and his deputy, name Torot, was or dered to proceed to the mountains to get full in for mation on the affair. On November 20, Deputy Torot returned and reported that the Subanun camps on the Bobhoran river were about 4-1/2 days from Dapitan, the station of the PC First Company. He also reported being stopped by about 30 men and was taken to their two leaders, Romualdo and Islao. When the people were told that the Constabulary troops were coming, there was tension and near panic in the camps. Some Subanuns prepared to run away. Later, they were prevailed upon by about thirty moros among them to remain and to take their spears and lances. With the in for mation. Captain Elarth and his troops started for Dapeok and requested Misamis to send rein¬ for cements to the area. On November 28, at about 12:30 p. m. they met a group of Subanuns who were returning to their homes. 296 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE After negotiations, Capt. Elarth started talks with the leaders, appealing to them to lay down their weapons and arms. The band obeyed and their spears and lances were confiscated but the or dinary bolos were returned. Capt. Elarth found out that the band was tired “waiting to go to heaven” and decided to go home to Toogan as food shortages in the camps were creating suffering. Rice and money were given to the band. One was asked to ac¬ company the troops to the camp. Upon reaching the camp, the Subanuns scampered to the bushes. Headman Torot was or dered to contact the leaders for talks. Six of them came out to give in for mation. Then the troops took positions nearby, trying to persuade the people to abandon their activities. But the Moros and Visayans among them, about 40 to 50, started to agitate the Subanuns. Soon about a thousand were out with their spears and lances. The message was clear that a fight was eminent. There was no doubt that the Moros would lead the charge. An appeal to lay down their arms was foiled by a big Moro who was apparently the leader. At his shout, the spears and lances were hurled and the Moros at tacked the troops. After the fight, six constabulary, one policeman and four cargadores were killed. On the other side, 20 to 40 were killed, mainly Moros. Capt. Elarth was saved from a Moro spear by Sgt. Bernardo Aimes who shielded him from the thrust and died. To avoid another at tack from the “fanatics,” the troops with drew and returned to camp, bringing with them the guns and ammunitions of their dead who were left behind unburied. The Constabulary report ended with refer¬ ence to a detachment appearing in the site of the encounter and the conclusion that the Moros and Visayans were the brains behind the movement for some sinister purposes and material gains.

F. Literature of Resistance While the elite was coopted by colonialism thus giving to the masses the mantle of revolution and armed resistance, there were those among the ilustrados who contributed in tellectually to the revolutionary cause despite the passage of the Sedition. Act of 1902 which punished any form of agitation or sedition, in cluding through the printed page or the the atre. Tagalog writers expressed resistance through the zarzuela which was a popular form of entertainment during the Spanish period. Dramas were also effectively used in, at tacking American colonialism. Juan Abad wrote the play Tanikalang Ginto and was punished by the court for sedition and sentenced to two years imprisonment and $2,000 THE CONTINUING RESISTANCE (1901-1913) 297 fine. But he was later acquitted by the Supreme Court to which the case was elevated after a tedious trial. Not cowed by the punishment, Abad continued to write seditious plays in cluding Isang Punlo ng Kaaway. ” But perhaps of far reaching significance was Aurelio Tolen¬ tino’s role in the literary struggle. His nationalistic play Kaha- pony Ngay on at Bukas in dicted American rule and predicated the outbreak of violent Filipino resistance to further American in trusion. Tolentino meant to in fect the rest of the country with the virus of nationalism and his play was translated into Pampango and Bikol. The play was also shown in various the at res in the country, especially in Manila, thus getting the ire of the American authorities. In 1905, Tolentino was arrested and tried for sedition and was given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Although his term was reduced subsequently to fifteen, and then to eight, it was not until 1912 that he was pardoned by Governor William C. Forbes. The literature of resistance was not limited to dramatists and playwrights. Newsmen and journalists were also active in articulating the value of in dependence and the need for national¬ ism. Those of the elite or ilustrados who figured in this type of resistance were Jaime C. de Veyra of Leyte, Sergio Osmeha of Cebu, Rafael Palma of Manila, and several others, in cluding those in the Visayas and Mindanao. El Nuevo Dia, which was founded by Osmena, was known for its nationalistic fervor. De Veyra and Palma were regular contributors. The same was true of the El Renacimiento which was founded by Palma. The paper exposed American anomalies and abuses in the government. The most famous of the cases was that of Interior Secretary Dean C. Worcester whose activities were summed up in libelous editorial entitled “Aves de Rapina” (Birds of Prey). \\ ****** 16 COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM The successful suppression of the various revolutionary out¬ breaks or disturbances following the for mal end of the Filipino- American War was enough reason for the Filipino elite to pursue the alternative of peaceful struggle. This prospect became quite clear when the American colonial authorities repeatedly of fered opportunities for Filipino cooperation and participation in the colonial government. In fact, the encouragement from the colonial of ficials was irresistible to the Filipino elite, especially the ilustra- dos, whose role in the 19 th century revolutionary movement throughout the archipelago, had been marked by readiness to compromise with colonialism. They did not find it in consistent at all to extend cooperation, first, to Spanish rule, and, now, to the American colonial venture. The extent and nature of Filipino in volvement in the pursuit of American colonialism can be cate¬ gorized under several leadings. A. Involvement During the Military Phase, 1899-1913 In 1899, the Schurman Commission, the first significant body created by President Mc Kinley, with Jacob Schurman, President of Cornell University, as head, in itiated the non-military approach of American colonialism and succeeded, after several months, in laying down the foundation of a subtle conquest of the Philippines through the cooperation of the Filipino elite. There was really no difficulty in winning over the elite, as Schur¬ man readily recognized, judging from the enthusiastic response of those who would later figure prominently in the electoral process as well as in executive appointments. Even the revolution¬ ary leaders who had been active in the anti-Spanish revolution were easily persuaded to serve under American rule. 1. The Christian Filipinos a. In the Local Level A notable example of this readines of the Filipino elite to 298 COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 299 collaborate was the case of Negros island, which had witnessed as early as 1898, to wards the end of Spanish rule, the division of the in habitants between the political and economic elite and the peasants and workers. The landowning class and the ilus- trados decided, upon the entry of the United States in the islands, to cooperate with the American colonialists. Prominent among the Negros elite who eventually became the stalwart supporters of American rule were Juan Araneta, Jose Luzuriaga, Leandro Locsin, Demetrio Larena, and Agustin Montilla. As early as November 1898 they or ganized the mselves into a pro¬ visional government clearly opposed to the Aguinaldo revo¬ lutionary government, hoping that by this step they would be able to get the American authorities to accept their of fer of loyalty to American rule. Efforts were exerted to contact the American authorities in the Visayas in or der that they could consider the desire of the Negros elite to make the island under effective American control"

As early as November 1898 they or ganized the mselves into a pro¬ visional government clearly opposed to the Aguinaldo revo¬ lutionary government, hoping that by this step they would be able to get the American authorities to accept their of fer of loyalty to American rule. Efforts were exerted to contact the American authorities in the Visayas in or der that they could consider the desire of the Negros elite to make the island under effective American control. But it was not until late in February 1899 that a committee of prominent landowners from Negros were welcomed by the military government under Gen. E. Otis who, subsequently, on March 1,1899, created the Visayan Military district with Gen. James F. Smith as Governor of Negros. With the American government now established in Negros, the Negrense provincial junta became its useful ally in the Amer¬ ican countermeasures against the Malolos government, represented in Negros by Aguinaldo-appointed emissaries, Quintin Salas and Zoilo Mauricio, and the masses led by their charismatic leader, “Papa Isio” or Dionisio Magbuela in real life. Attempts by Agui¬ naldo to win the elite failed and the open conflict between the colonial for ces and the Malolos government erupted. As noted earlier, the armed disturbances in the Visayas, in cluding Negros, were now definitely led by those who came from below, and the colonial government and the Filipino elite found the suppression of the disturbances not only costly but also difficult. The elite were particuarly plagued by at tacks on their properties and lands. But the conflict only drew the elite closer to colonialism. The same pattern of collaboration and compromise also was evident in Luzon. The Schurman Commission or ganized muni¬ cipal governments, starting with the first in Baliwag, Bulacan. Even with the outbreak of Filipino-American hostilities in February 1899, the peaceful process of pacification was focused on the for mation of local governments as fast as the areas were pacified and placed under American control. In fact, the penetration of 300 HISTORY OF THF FILIPINO PEOPLE to wns by American “peace feelers and agents” followed in the heels of Aguinaldo’s gradual retreat northward from Manila until his capture in 1901 in Isabela. Thus, by 1901, the American colonial government could disclose the pacification of the islands and the establishment of the civil government except in the Muslim South where civil rule would not be for med until the abolition of the military-governed Moro Province in 1913. The pattern of municipal or ganization was guided by a plan for mulated by a Committee headed by Chief Justice Cayetano Arellano of the Supreme Court. b. In the Central Government The most important manifestation of American cooperation of the elite was in the national level of administration. Being a highly centralized government, those few occupying the top executive, legislative, and judicial positions exercised vast powers and in¬ fluence in national affairs. The in volvement of the Filipino elite in this level was represented by those who were appointed as members of the Philippine Commission which performed executive and legislative powers and functions. Examples were Gregorio Araneta and Benito Legarda. It was in the judiciary where the Filipino elite was given substantial role in the person of Cayetano Arellano who was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Justice Arellano, a professor of law of Santo Tomas and top practising lawyer, was clear about his in clination and conviction. He believed in the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. c. Why the Elite The question that of ten recurs is why the Americans easily coopted the elite for colonial purposes and why the elite had no difficulty in shifting loyalty from Filipino to American rule. There were two basic reasons for the elite’s readiness to accept colonialism. First was the natural fear of losing the security of their in terests because of the growing demand of the masses for the redistribution of economic benefits and resources. There was still the reluctance to part with elite privileges in a feudal set-up where those of mixed blood had advantages over the native. It was clear that American colonial in terests would be ready to accommodate, in the to tal scheme of things, the elite’s desire to preserve their privileges. In fact, comparatively speaking, the prospects under American rule were much better than under COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 301 the previous Spanish regime. The second reason is the basic or ientation of the elite, which felt distrust in the in tegrity and character of the masses whom the elite regarded as potential trouble makers, bandits, and enemies of what they represented in society. Added to this low regard for the in tegrity of the masses was the contempt of the elite for what appeared as their general lack of knowledge, lo\\y in tellectual capacity, and question¬ able moral standard. In brief, the elite could not trust their in terests and future in the hands of the masses. The remarks and opinions of Cayetano Arellano and Trinidad Pardo de Tavera were examples of their condescending at titude to ward the Filipino masses similar to the way the Spanish colonizers looked at the natives. Pardo de Tavera was particularly notorious in his con¬ tempt for those below his class. The pro-Americanism of the elite was, to the Americans, not only encouraging but also remarkable for colonial purposes. It would not be long before the ilustrados would find the founding of the Federal Party not only a logical expression of their sentiment but also a political mechanism for helping the colonial administration in the in tellectual redirection of the Filipino people. 2. The Cultural Communities In the cultural communities, the Americans were also success¬ ful in coopting the ruling elite at the start of American rule. In the tribal communities, American teachers and missionaries opened the path to an understanding of American benevolent policy through schools, religious missions, and especially, medical work. a"

In the tribal communities, American teachers and missionaries opened the path to an understanding of American benevolent policy through schools, religious missions, and especially, medical work. a. In Mindanao It was a part of the American strategy to make use of the local datus and leaders to promote the need for social services. The building of schools was undertaken with American super¬ vision of native workers using existing local materials. This was, for in stance, illustrated by Datu Santiago of Cotabato and his men. The same was true of the campaign against in sanitary living conditions and diseases especially those that frequently led to epidemics like cholera, dysentery, smallpox, and malaria. Local leaders, with only a few exceptions, helped by setting personal examples of hygiene and proper sanitation. Education of children was very much emphasized, especially those of the ruling class. The schools for the Subanuns, the Tausugs in Sulu, and even a 302 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE proposed Datu School in Zamboanga were meant to prepare the ruling class for active in volvement in their own local areas. The critical role of American teachers was underlined by the Governor of the Moro Province, Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing. He remarked: “The school system depends for its success entirely upon the American teachers, and although Filipino teachers do excellent work under proper supervision, educational direction must for some time remain in the hands of the American teachers.” One of the most effective in struments of American educational policies was Dr. Najeeb M. Saleeby, a medical practitioner turned educator. His background as a Christian Arab, with education obtained from the American University in Beirut and a medical degree from New York’s Bellevue Medical School, gave him the kind of advantage to deal with the education of the Muslims in the Moro Province. His knowledge of Arabic and Islam provided him with a personal to uch that enabled him to win a lot of friends among the Muslim leaders, in cluding those that were opposed to American rule like Datu Ali of Cotabato, the royalties of Sulu, and the datus of Lanao. His in itial work as a medical surgeon in Malabang, Lanao provided opportunities to win the Ilanuns, a Muslim sub-ethnic group that had been associated with piratical at tacks on trading vessels in the southern seas. Consequently, his appointment as School Superintendent for the District of Mindanao and Jolo on June 1, 1903, after a brief assignment as Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Non Christian Tribes, led to the vigorous implementation of American educational objectives in the Moro Province. At the time of his tenure, there were 52 elementary schools in the province with a to tal enrollment of 2,114 pupils, 240 of whom were Muslims. The schools were handled by 15 American teachers, 50 Christians and 9 Muslims. By the time he resigned, on June 30, 1906 to become the new Secretary of the Moro Province under Governor Tasker H. Bliss, the school enrollment had reached 4,231 pupils. The Muslim enrollees also grew to 570. But lack of sympathetic understand¬ ing from his superiors frustrated Saleeby’s efforts and his views on the approach to the “Moro Problem” were somehow diluted. Other American teachers who contributed to the reorienta¬ tion of Mindanao in cluded both military and non-military person¬ nel. Charles R. Cameron, who succeeded Najeeb Saleeby as Superintendent, continued the educational program for the Muslims. Private Albert L. Burleigh of the 2 nd Infantry chose to teach Tausug children in Jolo. Unfortunately, his work was COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 303 shortlived. He was killed by four Moros on his way home from school. George Kindy, a teacher with agricultural in clination, in troduced farm schools in Bukidnon as a model for agricultural education in Mindanao. One of the enduring contributions of American education in Mindanao were the subsequent studies that emerged on various aspects of development such as Frances E. Batter’s Vocabulary English - Samal (1921), Charles Cameron’s Sulu Writing (1917), Charles V. Elliot’s A Vocabulary and Phrase Book of the Lanao Moro Dialect (1913), Robert T. Mc Cuthen’s Yakan-English, English-Yakan Vocabulary (1918), and Najeeb Saleeby’s Studies in Moro History, Law and Religion (1905) and A History of Sulu (1913). b. In the Cordillera In the Cordillera, the Americans were confronted by the many problems of the Filipino-American War which had brought the retreating for ces of 200 Filipinos under Aguinaldo to the traditionally hostile Ifugao country. To outside for ces, the Ifugao head-hunting activities were c on stant problems. But the pressure was not as difficult as the Spanish and Aguinaldo for ces.

By 1902, the ground was prepared for the American colonial govern¬ ment to study the set-up in the Cordillera through Dr. David P. Barrows who became the head of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes. By 1903, Secretary of the Interior Worcester had gotten Dominga Atandada of Dullayan and Rafael Baluyunoan to accept American rule. Later, about 92 chiefs and headmen of the Ifugao 304 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE country answered the American call for a conference to or ganize a government in the Ifugao area. Only the Nagacaran Ifugaos resisted the of fer and boycotted the meeting. The pacification efforts of the Americans found very encour¬ aging prospects in the pioneering activities of for mer military men like Samuel Kane and A 1 Hora whose business explorations and adventures provided later American of ficers and of ficials in sights into Ifugao character and psychology. Army of ficers, like Capt. Lewis Patstone in Nueva Vizcaya and Lt. Levi Case in Ifugao country, contributed a lot in preparing the Ifugaos for the event¬ ual establishment of American political structures in the area, in tegrating not only the Ifugaos but also the other Igorots into the Constabulary as soldiers and into the local government as presi- dentes (mayors) or cabecillas. By the beginning of 1906 the entry of Lt. Jeff D. Gallman into Ifugao country saw the beginning of an era of peace among the Ifugaos and American rule set the pace and patterns for the rest of the Cordillera. c. Treaty Traps In Southern Philippines, Muslim leadership was already divided into those who opposed and those who accepted American presence in 1899. But the latter group, which was represented by those in Sulu, allowed American presence with out necessarily accepting American sovereignty. In fact, the Bates Treaty signed by Sultan Jamalul Kiram and Gen. John C. Bates on August 20, 1899, clearly expressed this sort of political compromise. The Sulu signatories to the treaty revealed the extent to which local Sulu leadership was in volved in the American peace in itiative. With Datu Kalbi and Datu Julkanain signing the document, the Patikul political leadership had been added to those who supported American rule. This was a significant accomplishment of Amer¬ ican diplomacy because it represented, at the close of the 19 th century, the only meaningful opposition to the Sultanate whose political center was in Maimbung, the flourishing trading point in the southern part of Jolo. In the same manner, Patikul was the center of activities in the northern part. The treaty, there¬ fore, put behind American rule the entire political leadership of Sulu, leaving opposition to colonialism to lesser known leaders not connected with the ruling elite. The Treaty guaranteed peace between the Americans and Muslims in Sulu, but it should be noted that from the perspective COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 305 of the Sulu leadership, their relations with the new colonial govern¬ ment was one of political coexistence characterized by mutual respect for personal property and other rights. Under the treaty, the local leaders agreed to allow the Americans the freedom to trade and engage in commerce as well as the right to fly their own flag. Likewise, the Americans agreed not to in terfere in the in ternal affairs of the people, and in case of disputes and conflicts, to act in consultation with the local leaders, especially the Sultan. These were the general understanding and agreement guaranteed by the treaty as perceived by the local signatories. The Tausug version of the treaty clearly substantiates this view. But the English version of the Treaty clearly provides for the establishment of American rule in Sulu and the acceptance of American sovereignty by the Sultan and the datus. The version allowed the Americans to in terfere even in the resolution of disputes concerning matters related to slavery, taxes, peace and or der, trade, commerce, for eign relations, except in matters pertaining to religious practices and customs. The treaty pro¬ visions clearly gave to the United States the rights, prerogatives, and privileges of sovereignty. Consequently, the pursuit of activi¬ ties by the Sulu people and the American authorities would eventually come to conflict, creating the adverse situation that presaged th^ unilateral abrogation of the treaty in March 1904 by the colonial government as expressed through Governor General Howard Taft and Moro Province Governor Leonard Wood. The reaction of thu Sultan and the datus to the unilateral termination was a mixture of surprise and irritation. The treaty abrogration terminated the financial annuities the Sultan and other signatories had been receiving from the Americans since the conclusion of the agreement. But, perhaps, more felt was the dishonor and shame the American action had brought on the Sulu leadership. Such an in sult was bound to further erode the popular regard for the Sultanate as a political entity, especially after the demonstrations of American military technology in Lanao and Cotabato where Moro armed disturbances were effect¬ ively suppressed.

The Carpenter-Kiram Agreement, 1915 The effect of the persisting American belief in the Sultan’s in volvement led to the further emasculation of the sultanate through the Kiram-Carpenter Agreement of March 22, 1915, The agreement divested the Sultan of all his political power and prerogative. He was only allowed to exercise the rights and duties of a spiritual leader. Since under Islam there is no sepa¬ ration of power, the agreement created problems for the Sultan. It would be difficult to truly exercise spiritual in fluence with out the political authority the Sultan previously enjoyed. Hence, the Sultanate itself was seriously affected by the emasculation of the powers of the Sultan from which recovery would sub¬ sequently prove extremely difficult. In the “Note” prelimary to the main part of the Agreement, reference was made to certain political facts and realities as grounds for the unquestionable assumption by the United States of sovereignty over all that pertained to the Sultanate. These are: (1) recognition of the in dependent sovereignty of the Sultanate prior to American occupation; (2) the recognition of the partial exercise of sovereignty of the Sultanate by Spain during the latter part of the Spanish occupation of the Philippines but only in relation to for eign affairs and, to a lesser degree, only on the port of Jolo and four other points occupied by “ Spanish military garrisons”; and (3) the recognition of a partial but de facto temporal sovereignty of the United States under the Bates Treaty, whose provisions in Article IX allowed the United States to deal with cases of crimes and of fenses “committed by Moros against Moros”. What was underlined in the note was that the abrogation of the Bates Treaty by the United States was premised on “other matters than the de jure sovereignty of the Sultan,” who neither lost nor relinquished his sovereignty by conquest or otherwise until the signing of the agreement by Sultan Jamalul Kiram and Governor Frank W. Carpenter. The stipulations of the Agreement, expressed in no uncertain terms in five paragraphs, emphasized the to tal sovereignty of the United States over all the territory of the Sultanate in all aspects, except in matters of religion in which the Sultan, as titular spiritual head of his people, was allowed to exercise ecclesiastical authority. But even this exercise of spiritual or religious authority and its at tendant enjoyment of religious freedom must not be in violation of the basic principles of the laws of the United States. There is, COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM * ' 307 the refore, no doubt that, with the comprehensive provisions of the Agreement, the beginning of the end of the Sultanate was in itiated. At the same time also, the gradual rise of Filipino power over the Moros would become a reality in subsequent political developments in Moroland. B. Increase in Filipino Participation 1. Political Charge in the United States In 1912, the political climate in the United States had changed. Not only was a new president coming in — Woodrow Wilson — but a new political or ientation was expected to emerge from the change to Democratic rule. Since the turn of the century the Republican leadership had kept the conservative tradition of American policies unaltered, particularly in relation to colonial expansion. The Republican Administration had been associated with the acquisition of overseas colonies and the maintenance of those colonies for the business or economic in terests of Amer¬ ican society. In a sense, the establishment of American colonies, in cluding the Philippines, was part of the expansionist in ertia that came from the vigorous, westward expansion of the American colonists to the vast frontiers of Indian territories looking for new opportunities and lands until the Pacific coast of California was reached. It was here at the littoral of the west coast that the American spirit of conquest was literally challenged by the vast ocean that lay before it. The in ertia of the westward movement was there. It only needed the mitigation of other pressures that had transformed America from a rural to an urban technological society. The need for raw materials and markets added an economic dimension to American territorial expansion just as the in fluence of the Great Commission brought in the religious vision of the fundamentalists of America to see the gospel message preached to the “regions beyond.” All these political, economic and socio-cultural motiva¬ tions were ideals the Republican Party had sought to uphold. 2. Effects on Colony The Democratic Party administration, which differed to some extent from the Republican, was expected to bring some changes in American expansionist policy and direction. It had been associ¬ ated with the populist in terests of American society, with the working men and farmers. Therefore, the acquisition and main- 308 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE tenance of overseas colonies were not paramount. But the policy adopted did not altogether lead to the abandonment of the acquired territories. Possessions like the Philippines were maintained but the measure of control was somewhat modified to allow greater native participation in government and the realistic preparation for eventual in dependence. What, the refore, followed the Republican defeat in the Presi¬ dential election of 1912 was the appointment, in 1913, of Francis Burton Harrison as the first Democratic Governor General for the Philippines"

What, the refore, followed the Republican defeat in the Presi¬ dential election of 1912 was the appointment, in 1913, of Francis Burton Harrison as the first Democratic Governor General for the Philippines. As subsequent developments would show, Amer¬ ican rule in the Philippines under Harrison saw the realistic imple¬ ment at ion of American policies, the change from mere the or etical to actual grant of substantial participation in the government to Filipinos. In the executive branch, there was a change from an American to a Filipino majority in the Philippine Commission in 1913 and in the Council of State and the Board of Control in 1918. The Council of State was the advisory body of the Chief Executive while the Board of Control regulated government parti¬ cipation in business corporations and firms. Furthermore, the Civil Service had become, by 1913, seventy percent Filipino. By the end of Harrison’s term in 1921, the Civil Service had only about six per cent Americans. This “rapid Filipinization” of the government, as Harrison’s colonial policy was called, was also evident in the legislative branch of the government. Before 1916, legislation was still under the dominant control of the Americans. Only the Philip¬ pine Assembly, which was created in 1907, was Filipino. But, by virtue of its function as the ‘ lower house,” it was subordi¬ nate to the Philippine Commission which serve as the “upper house” and, at the same time, as a Cabinet of the Governor General. It was not until the Jones Law was passed in 1916 that the legislative power in the islands was given to the Filipinos. Only the veto power of the Chief Executive in a presidential. system remained as the source of American control over legisla¬ tion. Under the Jones Law a bicameral legislature was created composed of a 24-member Senate as the upper house and a House of Representatives as the house Chamber. All the members of the legislature were elected except the two Senators from the non-Christian sector, who were appointed by the Governor General. While the national structure was opening up to Filipino. irticipation, the local government continued to strengthen the COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 309 Filipino role in local administration from the provincial to the municipal level. The American in fluence was in the position of provincial treasurer which was held by Americans. Except for the general power of supervision, the municipal government was under Filipino control. The judiciary had already seen substantial Filipino participa¬ tion since the creation of the Supreme Court in 1899. In 1901 Cayetano Arellano became Chief Justice. The lower courts had both American and Filipino judges, with the latter in creasingly growing in number. C. Limits to Filipinization 1. Restraints of Elitism While Filipinization gained momentum under the Harrison administration, there was a fundamental limitation to the extent of its enjoyment in Filipino society. It was obvious that from the list of those who represented the Filipinos in the various levels of the bureaucracy, Filipinization in volved only the upper crust of Filipino society, those who belonged to the national and local elite. Without exception, the Filipino members of the Philippine Commission were from the landlord and capitalist families; so were those in the choice positions in the Civil Service; Even. the municipal level of the government was manned by elective of ficials who came from the local elite. This was in sured by the limitation of the electoral choice to only qualified residents. Under the law those who could run for of fice must be able to read and write, and must be property owners, or have been govern¬ ment employees during the Spanish period. In effect, the election law already limited participation to the elite. This confinement of Filipino participation to the elite guaran¬ teed the success of American colonial administration, notwith¬ standing the numerical dominance of the Filipinos in government. The elite had already demonstrated the positive role they could play and the Americans clearly saw the natural in clination of the elite to meaningful practical collaboration with the colonial power. The in terests of the elite were compatible with that of colonialism and the Americans were ready to give them a signif¬ icant share of power, wealth, and status in the islands. Not only were their traditional rights and privileges recognized but also their right to a new access to external power which they could not have acquired with out compromising with the colonial power. 310 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE There were, the refore, a lot of practical advantages the elite could get from the American colonial government compared to the almost nil of ferings under Spanish rule. Consequently, the Amer¬ ican liberal approach to compromise with Filipino leadership earned for the United States the cooperation and loyalty of the Filipino elite. This was, perhaps, the underlying basis of American readiness to give more and more to Filipinos the administration of the bureaucracy except the highest executive post in the islands, the position of Secretary of Public Instruction and the positions controlling the finances of the islands such as the Na¬ tion al Treasury, the Bureau of Customs, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the local treasuries. The control of the sources of revenues and their use was enough to neutralize any adverse effects of Filipinization on American control in the colony. The American authorities knew that aside from a superior military force, economic control is basic to political control. Thus, Filipinization, as implemented by the Democratic administration, fitted into the overall scheme of colonial rule. It was an aid, not hindrance, to colonial compromise for as long as it could be kept within the upper crust of Filipino society"

Thus, Filipinization, as implemented by the Democratic administration, fitted into the overall scheme of colonial rule. It was an aid, not hindrance, to colonial compromise for as long as it could be kept within the upper crust of Filipino society. But the moment it was extended to those who came from below, such as would occur in the 1920 s and 1930 s, Filipinization would in vite the threat to American liberal democratic rule. What emerged, however, from the colonial version of Filipinization was the dilemma of the Filipino elite, and the problems of Fili¬ pino values in the bureaucracy. 2. Economic Limitation The dilemma of Filipino leadership was best seen in the economic relations with the United States during the Harrison era (1913-1920). Before this period, the economic policy of the United States was anchored entirely on the ambiguities of the Paris Treaty of 1898 and later, on the “free trade” provisions of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909. Until 1909, American economic in terests would be affected by the most-favored-nation treatment given to Spain for a period of ten years under the Treaty of Paris, thus preventing the enactment of any trade policy favorable to American economic in terests. The end of the ten-year privilege in 1909 gave the United States the first oppor¬ tunity to in itiate what became popularly known as “Free Trade.” This was a unique kind of relation because the exercise of free¬ dom by the United States and the Philippines was not equal. COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 311 The freedom of Filipino in terests was limited by a quota system while that of American in terests was absolutely free. The limita¬ tion to Filipino economic in terests in volved the volume and kind of export, while no similar restriction was placed on American in terests. Consequently, the Philippines became almost an ex¬ clusive American market with American goods literally moving into the colony with out limitation. But Philippine exports to the American market were governed by quotas and limited only to raw materials needed by American business. Thus, as relations of economic dependency became the pattern of Philippine rela¬ tions with the United States, conversely, American control of the Philippine economy, and consequently, Philippine leadership, was firmly established by the time the Underwood-Simmons Tariff Act was enacted in 1913 abolishing the quotas on Philip¬ pine exports. There was, the refore, “free trade” literally between the Philippines and the United States during Harrison’s term and beyond, until 1934 when the quotas were reimposed by the Tydings-Mc Duffie law. It was during this liberal trade policy that the partnership between Filipino and American economic in terests was strengthened by the dependence of the Filipino land¬ owning class on lucrative American markets for their agricultural exports. This economic dependence would continue to be rein¬ for ced through the years and the role of the Filipino elite would also be in extricably tied to the preservation of American rights and privileges not only in the economic area but also in the poli¬ tical, social, and cultural fields. D. Social Effects of Filipinization 1. Tradition vs. Modernism The establishment of American liberal democracy as the new pattern of the Filipino way of life would bring about the con¬ frontation between Filipino traditional ways and the new system. The basic differences in values would eventually create a dicho¬ tomy of systems in which a democratic form and a traditional essence were welded to create a “democracy Filipino style”. From the outside, the world saw the American democratic structure in the Philippines largely manned by “little brown Americans,” illustrating one of the most successful colonial experiments in the non-Westem world. The three branches of the government, copied exactly from the American model minus the “federal” aspect, discharged their roles as co-equal units of 312 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE government, with the Filipino elite showing their special role no longer as “collaborators” from their viewpoint but as “partners” in the new democracy. The social system started to display the realignment of people along the lines of a perceptible American class consciousness which gave premier at tention to the elite and encouragement to a new middle class of professionals, with the masses relatively kept contented with some measure of socio¬ economic benefits from the new democratic system in volving free edupation, health and sanitation, public works and trans¬ portation, various employment opportunities, and ready markets for agricultural products. Added to all these democratic activities was a dynamic cultural process which in volved the in troduction and propagation of American popular activities such as ball games, restaurants and eateries, movies, sports, and arts. In brief, the American democratic style had found a distinct place in Filipino life. 2. Democracy Filipino Style But before the end of Harrison’s term, the American colonial administration would notice that only the form of democracy was in evidence. The essence of democracy had yet to be developed. The Filipino values, rooted in ancient traditions, continued to manifest their in fluence in the actual operation of the new demo¬ cracy. Even the elite, who had already been coopted by colonial¬ ism, had not. abandoned their traditional values which had kept their ties with Filipino society unaffected. Consequently, Amer¬ ican colonial of ficials who continued to occupy the top level of the bureaucracy began to see the dichotomy of Western and tra¬ ditional values creating the “undergrowths” of democracy.

Even Fili¬ pino disregard for working time was noted so that the common perception of colonial of ficials was that rapid Filipinization was disastrous to American colonial administration and that Harrison erred in giving to Filipinos more and more responsi¬ bilities and powers. What the Americans failed to see was the fact that the Filipinos saw no contradiction between the new democratic in stitutions and traditional practices. The passion for the rule of law, which the Americans exemplified, was regard¬ ed by the Filipinos as subordinate to the old system based on COMPROMISE WITH COLONIALISM 313 ritual kinship, pakikisama, utang na loob and other values which had preserved harmony in the native society. t Thus, to ward the end of the Harrison Era charges of Filipino in competence in the bureaucracy, graft and corruption, and the unpreparedness of the Filipinos for in dependence, in general, became the common basis of criticism against the administration of Governor Francis B. Harrison. But to the Filipinos, Harrison’s term was the best because it was a demonstration of what trust could do to Filipino-American relations. Filipinos looked back to the time as the emergence of a dynamic Filipino leadership trying to create its own democratic form. COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY The Democratic Administration of Harrison and Wilson completed its eight years in of fice, in March 1921, with out ful¬ filling its long-standing commitment to Philippine in dependence. In December 1920, after nearly eight years as President and just after his party had been decidedly defeated in the elections, Wilson made his only recommendation to Congress in favor of Philippine in dependence... This Congress was, however, Republican- controlled and as expected, it did not respond to the President’s suggestions for in dependence legislation. The Wood-Forbes Mission In March 1921, the succeeding Republican Administration of Warren G. Harding sought to verify Filipino preparedness for in dependence in view of the rapid Filipinization that took place during the Harrison administration. Harrison, believing that rapid and complete Filipinization of the government was essential if the Filipinos were to learn to maintain a fully in¬ dependent government in the future, allowed the Filipinos to assume almost complete management of their political and economic affairs, even to the point of sacrificing efficiency and good government. A special in vestigating mission, led by two old Philippine- hands- for mer Governor General W. Cameron Forbes and Maj Gen. Leonard Wood — was appointed to look into Philippine affairs. The Wood-Forbes Mission spent four months in the Philippines, at the conclusion of which a lenghthy report was submitted to the president which reflected in very clear terms the situation in the Philippines at the end of Harrison’s tenure. It also reflected very clearly the Philippine policy of the Republican Party which was unsympathetic to any proposal in volving Amer¬ ica’s with drawal from the Philippines in the near future. The Wood-Forbes Mission report in dicted the previous regime for many of the problems noted in the in vestigation, and viewed the government as “not reasonably free from those underlying causes which result in the destruction of government.” Among the criticisms were: lack of a sufficient press which would 314 COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 315 in sure a sound public opinion; mistakes in finances; delay in the administration of justice; the need for good teachers both in the lower schools and in the higher in stitutions of learning; and in¬ adequate treatment and care of cultural minorities. It recom¬ mended that “the present general status of the Philippine Islands continue until the people have had time to absorb and thoroughly master the powers already in their hands.” The Administration of Leonard Wood (1921-1927) The choice of Leonard Wood as Governor General demonstra¬ ted that President Harding accepted the Wood-Forbes Mission’s recommendations as to Philippine policy and that he looked to Wood to remedy the unfortunate conditions pointed out in the Mission’s report. It is/in deed,. unfortunate that Wood became Governor General so soon after the completion of his mission, a difficulty which he himself had for seen, and which situation un¬ doubtedly colored his relations with the Filipino politicians whose performance he had just in dicted. After an in itial period marked by amicable relations and cooperation, the administra¬ tion of Governor Wood was marked by vigorous political agita¬ tion — the most in tense in Philippine-American relations since the end of the Filipino-American War. Wood was unlike Harrison. He took the position that the Jones Law — the or ganic act operating in the Philippines — could not be modified except by action of the US Congress itself, and that no subsequent legislation or executive action on the part of the Governor General or the President of the United States, working in copjunction with the Philippine Legislature, could operate to change this fundamental law. Fully cognizant of Wood’s political philosophy, the Filipino leaders were on guard against expected “encroachments” on their powers by the Governor General.

Nationalistic feelings were aroused by holding up the Governor as the enemy of Philippine autonomy and in dependence. The open break between Wood and the Filipino leaders led by Senate President Quezon was not unexpected. Since assuming 316 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE his position as Governor General, Wood had let it be known that unlike his predecessor, he was bent on exercising the powers of his of fice after the manner of an American chief executive and definitely not as an impotent figurehead. He was deter¬ mined to govern and to assume active leadership to remedy the maladministration which he had found in the country. His deter¬ mination to truly govern was met by the Filipino leaders with counter-of fensives, for they in terpreted this as a threat to the autonomy they already enjoyed. Accustomed as they were to playing a dominant role during the previous Harrison adminis¬ tration, they desired supremacy in in sular affairs, and no in ter¬ ference from the Governor General except in matters directly affecting the in terests of the United States in the Philippines. Wood not only found himself unable to sympathize with the desire of the Filipino nationalists for an in creasing measure of self-government, but he also opposed in dependence, except perhaps in the very distant future. The American government, he explained, would not consider any extension of further autonomy until the weaknesses pointed out in the Wood-Forbes Mission Report had been corrected. Complete in dependence would not be opposed, he said, if the Filipinos were “in dustrially strong and could defend the mselves and hold their country.” He advised the Filipinos to cooperate wholeheartedly in making the govern¬ ment efficient, for in so doing they would strengthen their plea for in dependence. In the meantime, he in sisted on at tempting to persuade the Filipinos to postpone the issue of in dependence or to for get it altogether. In addition to differences of opinion on the operation of the Jones Law and the prerogatives exercised by the Governor General, there was an equally significant circumstance which brought on the “crisis’ — and that was the political situation confronting Quezon. Quezon, in 1922, was having trouble assuring his ascendancy among his own followers and political rivals within the Nacionalista Party. After launching his bid for supremacy by breaking away from Osmena’s Partido Nacionalista, Quezon found his leadership none too secure — especially with the enhanced strength of the minority Democratas after the elections of 1922. In or der to dominate the Legislature, Quezon reconciled with Osmena’s Nacionalistas,. a move his followers considered an “outrageous betrayal of the people’s trust.” Faced with a rebel¬ lious segment of his party and a resurgent Democrata Party, Quezon needed an issue to strengthen his leadership and his COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 317 party. The Governor General got himself caught in the web of Filipino partisan politics and this, combined with the highly emotional issue of in dependence, magnified tensions with Governor Wood. The Conley Case and the Cabinet Crisis Wood’s action in a police matter known as the Conley Case provided Quezon with an issue, and he used it to bring on the “Cabinet Crisis.” By engineering this crisis, Quezon succeeded in electrifying an electorate which promptly supported the Quezon-Osmeha coalition. The controversy arose over charges of misconduct in of fice filed against an American named Ray Conley, chief of the vice¬ squad of the Secret Service Branch of the Manila Police Depart¬ ment. Charges had been made against Conley from time to time, apparently in retaliation for his efficient crusade against or gan¬ ized crime in Manila. In 1922, charges, in cluding the keeping of a mistress and the making of certain false statements relating to her, were pre¬ sented by a local at to rney to the Prosecuting Attorney of the City of Manila who, after thorough in vestigation, found no grounds to proceed. The charges were then repeated to the Director of the Civil Service, who refused to take any action because of the manifest connection of Conley’s accusers with gambling elements in Manila. The charges were then sent to the Office of the Governor, on July 17, 1922, and the of fice referred them the next day to the Mayor of Manila, Ramon J. Fernandez, for in vestigation. The papers were not returned by the Mayor until December 28. During this period, a most exhaustive in vestigation was con¬ ducted, under the Mayor’s or ders, by the Chief of Police, John Green, who reported, in effect that the charge., were in stigated by gamblers in or der to get rid of Conley, who was making the gambling business unprofitable. The Mayor, in returning the papers to Governor Wood, made no comment other than to in vite at tention to the findings of the Chief of Police. The Governor General accordingly dimissed the charges. Subsequently, the Secretary of the Interior, Jose P. Laurel who had confirmed Conley’s appointment to the police force, received numerous complaints that Conley had received bribes 318 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE from gamblers in Manila.

They were in sistent upon an administrative in¬ vestigation to be conducted in their own departments, but Wood in sisted that the case be submitted to the Court of First Instance to give Conley a fair trial. After a prolonged trial the court found that charges were not sustained and dismissed them. Though the court acquitted Conley, in its decision it had stated that the detective’s record was not free from doubts and suspicions. Secretary Laurel seized upon this statement and requested again that Wood appoint a com¬ mittee to in vestigate Conley administratively. At first objecting, the Governor subsequently appointed a Committee on Investigation in structed to in vestigate the Manila Police Department in general. The Committee, in prelimary report, recommended Conley’s reinstatement, whereupon the Governor endorsed the immediate compliance by Secretary Laurel of Conley’s reinstatement. Secretary Laurel transmitted the wish of the Governor General to the City Mayor, requesting compliance, while he tendered his resignation in protest to Con¬ ley’s reinstatement. Upon receipt of Laurel’s endorsement, the Mayor left his of fice with out complying with the request, and then subsequently submitted his own resignation. The Chief of Police reinstated Conley, who was subsequently retired. Accusing the Governor with having meddled with and dicta¬ ted details of Philippine government which should have been left entirely to the Filipino of ficials, the President of the Senate (Manuel L. Quezon), the Speaker of the House (Manuel A. Roxas), and all the Filipino Secretaries tendered their resignations as members of the Council of State and as heads of Departments on July 17, 1923. With the resignations of the Department Secretaries, the Undersecretaries promptly took over the positions and adminis¬ tered the Departments till the end of Wood’s term in 1927, for the Senate refused to confirm the Governor’s appointments to vacancies in the Cabinet. In presenting the Filipino side, the Legislature explained that “it was a protest against the encroachment by the Governor COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 319 General on the constitutional rights already enjoyed by the Fi¬ lipinos and against the usurpation of power in direct violation of existing laws.” Wood pointed the finger of accusation at Quezon and his followers... Quezon, who was concerned about his political future, “became impatient and provoked” the Cabinet Crisis. Be that as it may, Quezon succeeded in making the re¬ signation episode a “national issue,” raiding various issues to stir up public sentiment against the Governor’s administration. The chasm created by the Cabinet Crisis was never really bridged during the remaining years of Wood’s administration. The major issue remained the delineation of executive and legis¬ lative powers, or the autonomy of the Filipino people versus the powers of the Governor General as the representative of American sovereignty. The Governor’s Veto Power The veto power of Governor Wood, in the eyes of the Fili¬ pino leaders, was being excessively exercised, “on the most flimsy motives.” Governor Wood’s veto record showed the following: From October 1923 to February 1924, the Sixth Philippine Legislature passed 217 bills and concurrent resolutions, out of which 46 were vetoed, the bills not having been presented until after the adjournment of the Legislature so that, Wood comment¬ ed, conference with a view to modification or correction of errors was possible. In the first session of the Seventh Legislature in 1925, twenty-four out of sevenjty-two bills were vetoed; and in the second session in 1926, the Legislature passed 122 bills, out of which 44 were vetoed. Harrison vetoed only five measures in seven years in of fice. Not only did the Governor exercise liberally his power to veto bills passed by the Legislature, but he even went to the extent of altering measures already passed by the Legislature, and then affixing his signature after the alteration was made. The Filipino leaders were also annoyed that Wood should veto bills of local in terest and in sisted that before the Governor General acted unfavorably on any bill, their views must first be heard. Nearly all vetoes, Wood explained, were due to serious defects or unconstitutional provisions. This unsatifactory condition was largely due to the rushing through of a large number of bills during the last hours of the session, with out opportunity being 320 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE given for their careful consideration. This delay, Wood maintained, occurred every year and of ten prevented desirable legislation from being approved. In some in stances, Wood was convinced that the Filipino leaders deliberately showered him with im¬ practicable legislation to draw his vetoes and thus give them fresh opportunity to charge him with ‘‘despotism.” The Board of Control Controversy Wood was determined to get the government out of business, the government in Harrison’s time having created and controlled stocks in various government corporations through the Board of Control. Wood was convinced that the Board was illegal because the Governor General occupied a minority position in it (in violation of the Organic Act which placed supreme executive control in the hands of the Governor General), and so he could never get the consent of the two Filipino members (the Senate President and the House Speaker) to get the government out of business"

There were two fundamental reasons advanced by Wood for getting the government out of business: first, that the Philip¬ pine treasury needed the money in vested in the business enter¬ prises to spend it for the greater benefit of the public; and second, that governments were not qualified, in any nation of the world, to conduct business or engage in any in dustries which would compete with private in itiative. Wood was unhappy with the graft and mismanagement which he saw and felt that the only hope for the enterprises was to put them in the hands of experi¬ enced American businessmen. The Filipino leaders, on the other hand, wished the continuance of the companies and a share in their management through the Board of Control, for to them, acceptance of the Governor’s policy would have meant domination by American capital, a situation which might prejudice their campaign for in dependence. All efforts to ward amicable settlement proved futile. By early 1926, Governor Wood had reached the end of his patience with the “perfectly impossible” Board of Control and was eager to get rid of the dominating control in it of Quezon and Roxas. On November 9, 1926, acting upon opinions received from American of ficials in Washington, he abolished the Board of Control, thus removing what he saw as the most serious encroach- m* nt on the executive power in the Philippines. The or der pro- COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 321 vided that the reafter, all duties of the Board of Control would be exercised by the Governor General. The Philippine Supreme Court upheld the legality of the action of the Governor General aiid the US Supreme Court sus¬ tained the decision. Leonard Wood: In Retrospect Leonard Wood’s tenure as Governor General of the Philip¬ pines was marked by deadlock and political strife, with the Fili¬ pino politicos led by Quezon openly challenging the authority of the American representative in Manila. The friction grew out of the Governor’s program to restore American supervision and control, paicicularly with respect to the functions of the Legis¬ lature. But there were some who thought it was greatly exa¬ cerbated by the clash between the personal ambitions of the Filipino political leaders and Wood’s desire to exercise what he saw as “the in herent rights of the Governor General.” And be¬ cause the contest was hopelessly enmeshed in the consuming emotional issue of in dependence, the political rancor was fanned by distrust and prejudice. Any Governor General who was sent to the Philippines after Harrison probably would have found the Filipino leaders parti¬ cularly difficult to handle, unless he went as far as Harrison did in allowing the Filipinos a generous share in the direction of their affairs. Wood was of a different mind - - he was convinced that the Filipinos had taken an enormous stride backward during the Harrison administration. He found v.*e Philippine govern¬ ment bogged down in a major financial crisis and riddled with in efficiency, graft and nepotism. He, the refore, saw it as his responsibility to reform the “critical situation” and restore the country to an efficient and or derly government worthy of Amer¬ ican sponsorship. He probably had the right prescription for the Philippines — honesty in government and a tight administration but his approach was hardly the most effective one. Contentious and imperial, he showed little consideration for the sensitive feelings of the Filipinos, for whom self-esteem, personal honor, and that in comprehensible (to the Westerner) worship of “face” were important matters. Governor Wood’s experience all his life had been that of an administrator with absolute authority, con¬ cerned with results. Had he thought more of methods and aimed somewhat lower in results, he might have gotten on better in 322 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Philippines. But so for ceful a personality, so powerful a will, such devotion to results produced compelling power. And the Filipino leaders reacted against that power of in tervention in their affairs. Wood’s political philosophy and economic views, his mili¬ tary background (thirty years in the military), his personality as well as his physical condition, all contributed to his troubles in the Philippines. It would not be fair and accurate, however, to speak as if the only responsibility was Wood’s. The Filipino leaders, especially Quezon, must share in the burden for the state of affairs during Wood’s tenure in the Philippines. Partisan politics undoubtedly had much to do with the “crisis” which clouded most of Governor Wood’s term. Quezon’s lust for power (in the struggle to win supremacy over Osmena’s leader¬ ship) and his various maneuvers to shore up his sometimes falter¬ ing leadership made him difficult to deal with. After 1923, Quezon exaggerated his dissatisfaction with many aspects of the administration of Governor Wood for his own political needs. Perhaps the situation in Manila would not have been what it was had Wood faced a man unlike Quezon. Quezon was a proud, volatile, charismatic personality, with a tremendous capa¬ city to manipulate people and events and to mobilize them to serve his needs. In 1923, he found the “supreme moment” he needed to establish his leadership. So he turned an otherwise trivial matter into a national issue and succeeded in setting himself up as the heroic champion of Filipino nationalism. Having launched the at tack on Wood, he found it politically useful to disagree with the Governor General on almost every fundamental issue affect¬ ing the Philippines.

The Governor General unwittingly helped him by stubbornly resisting him and in sisting on his rights. It also did not help that, to the Filipinos, Governor Wood was not an endearing personality. He was not simpatico. Except to his close friends, he was a very frigid personality, who for the most part wore the look of seriousness, if not severity. Though at bottom there was, in deed, much politics in the confrontation between Wood and the Filipino leaders, that was certainly not all of it. A serious bone of contention between Wood and the Filipino leaders was; of course, the issue of in dependence. Wood opposed COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 323 Philippine in dependence and bitterly resented the agitation for it by the nationalistic politicos. It was impossible, he said, to even think of in dependence when conditions were so unsatis¬ factory and the Filipino leaders were to tally lacking in quali¬ ties for leadership. He believed that America undertook a re¬ sponsibility to wards the Philippines, and it was futile for the Filipinos to wish for in dependence until America’s “noble task” had been completed. He possessed an exalted vision of the future of the Philippines and was baffled that the Filipino leaders did not have the same consuming passion as he had for devotion to duty, service to country, and the highest ideals of public morality. By consistently arguing against Filipino capacity and character, Wood of fended Filipino pride, for the argument implied (un¬ in tended perhaps) a natural white superiority unacceptable to the Filipinos. As an ardent nationalist himself, Wood failed to under¬ stand the aspirations of “backward peoples'’ for self-government, for to him the greatest blessing such peoples could receive was American rule over them. Wood failed to realize that after over two decades of pro¬ gressive autonomy, it was unrealistic to expect the Filipinos to agree to a prolonged postponement of in dependence, unless there was a definite declaration from the United States that in dependence would come, say, in 25 or 50 years, while in the meantime steps were taken to assure them that they were progress¬ ing to wards in dependence. It was even more unreal to expect that the Filipinos would elect self-government under for eign tutelage in preference to complete in dependence. For the United States had consciously set about to encourage Philippine national¬ ism and through political, economic, and educational devices, had advanced the desires as well as the means for its expression. No doubt Wood’s opposition to in dependence was due also to what he sincerely believed was the Filipino position. He accepted that the Filipinos all wanted in dependence, but be¬ lieved they were willing to trust the good faith of America so long as America did not seek to take a backward step (in rela¬ tion to in sular autonomy) and did not seek to turn the Philip¬ pines over to in terests which would exploit them and keep them permanently. It is unfortunate that Quezon and his colleagues felt them¬ selves for ced to maintain a false and in sincere position when they in sisted on complete, immediate, and absolute in dependence, 324 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE despite being aware that their country was not ready for in¬ dependence politically and financially (this is probably symp¬ to matic of the in direction which of ten characterizes Philippine society). But they were compelled to take that position because no declaration of definite policy was for thcoming from Washing¬ ton, and party politics dictated that they espouse the in depend¬ ence cause to enable them to keep their hold on the people. Wood, as a consequence, dismissed the in dependence move¬ ment as the agitation of a handful of self-in terested political leaders, and this apparent distaste for the current generation of politicians did not go well with the Filipino leaders. It was Wood’s wish that the United States would hold the Philippines until a young and clearer-visioned class of leaders had succeeded to power. Perhaps it would have made for more constructive relations had Wood accepted the force of the in dependence sentiment, however unreasonable it might have seemed to him, and then tried to work out the problems with the Filipino leaders in a manner that would not have been emabarrassing for the poli¬ ticos. In addition to opposing the movement to wards in dependance, Wood also opposed any further concessions with regards to auto¬ nomy, so long as the irregularities that had been pointed out by the Wood-Forbes Report remained uncorrected. Yet it would be unfair to say that Governor Wood reversed the movement to wards autonomy. He could not have done so — for while he wanted a modification of the Jones Law, he could only recommend such action. Congress had the prerogative of taking action, and did not do so. So Wood, in running the government, was also limited by the Jones Law. Besides political matters, the Filipino leaders disagreed with Wood on another fundamental issue - on economic policy affect¬ ing the disposition of the public domain and the administration of government-owned corporations.

The Filipinos were afraid that for eign capital would mean exploitation by for eigners and would nullify the ecoi omic policy established by the Legislature “for the protection of the rights and in terests of the Filipino people in the development of the resources of the islands.” So they COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 325 opposed the liberalization of land laws to accommodate tropical plantations (which would be for eign-financed and —owned) and the sale of government-owned businesses to for eign in terejts. Despite his shortcomings of body and mind, few would deny that Governor Wood was an able and devoted administrator. He worked hard and he knew the Philippines as few knew the country. Few would doubt that he was sincerely in terested in the welfare and in terests of the Philippines and the Filipinos, while, understandably enough, he also sought to work for Amer¬ ican in terests. Though Filipino leaders resented his unbending refusal to accede to their many efforts to undermine American control of the executive branch as Harrison had allowed them to, they recognized sincerity and honesty and had a high respect for his administrative ability. Many conceded that in spite of con¬ troversy, in spite of a serious illness, he had given the Filipinos a tradition of service in government and a loyalty to duty which were unmatched. Despite the problems of his administration, especially after 1923, there was sufficient cooperation between the Filipino and American elements to allow for some advances in govern¬ ment — such as in the rehabilitation of finances, advances in health and sanitation, efforts at in frastructure, and general economic prosperity. Wood governed the Philippines after 1923 with out any serious disruptions to governmental functions, in spite of the publicly avowed Filipino policy of non-cooperation. The Administration of Henry L. Stimson: Cooperation Restored Henry L. Stimson was in augurated Governor General of the Philippines on March 1, 1928. Fully cognizant of the con¬ troversies his predecessor had gotten himself in volved in, Stimson had determined to re-establish a working relationship with the Filipino leaders to remove the ill-feelings left over from the Wood Administration. Stimson consciously followed a different path. He seemed better able to understand the uses of power in dealing with dependent peoples. Thus, he was willing to compromise to win the confidence of the Filipino leaders. At the same time, he was firm in asserting his rights as Chief Executive. Stimson steered away from the emotional in dependence issue and concentrated on political or administrative cooperation, while for thrightly expressing his view that only that would “save the Islands from the danger of immediate in dependence.” In the 326 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE meantime, he favored a greater degree of autonomy, for he sym¬ pathized with the Filipino demand for more responsibility. Stimson had only one year in the Philippines, but this year was generally characterized by very cordial relations between the Filipino and American elements in government and society. In fact, the first complete Cabinet since July 1923 was named. * Stimson proceeded with the necessary steps for the creation of machinery for the restoration of “regular and responsible cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of the Philippine Government.” Among them were the provision of technical advisors and assistants to the Governor General through the Belo Act; the appointment of a Cabinet nominated by the Governor General, after conference with the leaders of the major¬ ity party in the Legislature; and the revival of the Council of State. Stimson also established a “new era” fpr the Philippines by a change of emphasis as to the prerequisites for in dependence - from the previous stress upon fitting the Filipinos for in depend¬ ence and sovereignty through training and responsibility in the political sphere, to an emphasis upon economic and in dustrial development of the Philippines’ natural resources as a sound basis for her in dependence. Stimson was, however, able to imple¬ ment only a portion of his economic program because of the genuine and natural fear of Filipinos of exploitation by for eign capital. Philippine land laws, for in stance, were not amended to allow for large landholdings. Nonetheless, at the end of his year’s experience in the Philip¬ pines, Stimson was pleased at the “general ment al change” he had discerned among the Filipino leaders, who had begun to consider the. “economic foundations of their political problems” and had come to realize that economic development could actual¬ ly aid their aspirations for self-government. Probably the most significant achievement of Stimson’s year in the Philippines was “the cessation of the period of acri¬ monious deadlock” and the substitution of cooperation and friendly feelings between the American authority and Filipino leadership. This Stimson was able to accomplish because he understood what was necessary in or der that the sensitive Filipinos would not be “provoked into fanatical outbursts.” COLONIAL POLITICS: TOWARDS COMPLETE AUTONOMY 327 Henry L.

The leaders of Philippine in dependence were given the freedom and the means to articulate their nationalist feelings, and in so doing won for the mselves a following and national prominence. The appeal for freedom was won through peaceful constitutional processes afforded the Filipinos by the sovereign power, which allowed them to move progressively to wards autonomy and inde¬ pendence. The period from 1919 to 1934 showed the evolution of American policy on Philippine in dependence and the various for¬ ces and circumstances which shaped that policy. It likewise brought into focus the sometimes uncertain steps taken by the Filipino leadership to articulate and accept the concept of an in dependent Filipino nation. The Filipino stand on in depend¬ ence was not always very clear — there was considerable confusion and vacillation on the matter — and American administration of ficials felt that much of the agitation was artificial and thought¬ less and too much tied up with in sular politics. Political leaders vied with one another to demonstrate the in tensity of their advocacy of in dependence. Though there was ambivalence in the Philippine approach to in dependence, perhaps part of the uncertainty was due to the fact that the United States also had no effective answer for Philip¬ pine in dependence — the only matter that was definite was the promise to grant in dependence in the future. Nevertheless each side was afforded the opportunity to for mulate policy as they openly discussed the issue of Philippine in dependence. In 1916 the Filipinos received the promise of in dependence “as soon as a stable government can be established” by them. The promise contained in the preamble of the Jones Law provided impetus to the rising tide of Filipino aspirations for immediate in dependence. However, agitation for in dependence was avoided during the World War as a gesture of loyalty to the United States. 328 THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 329 But by the end of the War in 1918, the Filipinos felt that they had established the stable government required by the Jones Law and that it was time for the United States to redeem its promise of in dependence to the Philippines. Encouraged by the Jones Law, the Filipino leaders concluded that in dependence from the United States could be ultimately ob¬ tained through in creased political pressure and an active campaign in favor of their cause. Heretofore the demand for in dependence had been voiced by means of for mal resolutions of the Philippine Assembly [and after 1916, of the Philippine Legislature] delivered to the American Congress through the Resident Commissioners in Washington, of which Manuel L. Quezon was probably the most impressive. After 1918, a more sustained effort to terminate American rule would be undertaken, with the appeal for freedom taken directly by the Filipinos to Washington through the par¬ liamentary missions or legislative committees sent by the Com¬ mission of Independence. The leaders who in volved the mselves in this campaign had been on the Philippine political scene from 1907 — all members of the educated elite and all products of American tutelage. After two decades of American direction, these politically active Filipinos felt confident that they had sufficiently advanced in experience and participation in public affairs to enable them to manage their country on their own. The Commission of Independence In November 1918, the Philippine Legislature created the Commission of Independence “for the purpose of studying all matters related to the negotiation and or ganization of the in¬ dependence of the Philippines.” The Commission was given “full power and jurisdiction to act for the Philippine Legislature and represent it in all respects during the recess of said Legislature.” In March 1919, the Legislature approved a Declaration of Pur¬ poses for the guidance of the Commission. This declaration laid down the task of the Commission, which was urged to work for early in dependence to relieve “the anxiety of our people which two decades of occupation have only served to accentuate.” As or iginally or ganized in 1918, the Commission was com¬ posed of eleven senators and forty congressmen, in cluding the presiding of ficers of both houses of the Philippine Legislature, who were to be its chairmen. Subsequently membership was 330 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE expanded to in clude all members of the Philippine Legislature regardless of party affiliation, but the leadership remained Natio¬ nalists the majority party. The most important undertaking of the Commission was the dispatch of in dependence missions to the United States and the direction of the publicity campaign for in dependence. Independence missions were sent largely through the in itiative of the Nacionalista leaders in the legislature, with occasional Democrata (the opposition minority party) participation to give the campaign a semblance of national unity. Those who were prominently in volved were Manuel L. Quezon, Sergio Osmena, Manuel A. Roxas, Jose Abad Santos, Benigno Aquino, Sr., Camilo Osias, Elpidio Quirino, all Nacionalistas, and Claro M.

Recto, Emilio Tria Tirona, Juan Sumulong, Pedro Gil, Ruperto Mon- tinola, all Democratas. The missions presented a set argument in favor of their cause: that in dependence was the great national ideal of the Filipino people; that America had declared it her policy to with draw her sovereignty over the Philippines and to recognize Philippine in dependence as soon as a stable government had been established; that a stable government managed and supported by the Filipinos the mselves had been established and that it could and would be maintained by an in dependent Philippine government; and finally, that the United States should fulfill its promise of in dependence. Alongside the missions, the Commission also conducted a publicity campaign in the United States, through the Philippine Press Bureau, established in Washington in April 1919. The pub¬ licity campaign was aimed at developing the necessary in terest in Congress and the American public to compel consideration of the Philippine question, which admittedly received little pre¬ ferential at tention from Americans. A Press Bulletin was cir¬ culated in the United States until 1924, and American writers and publicists were hired to ‘‘advertise an entire people.” To finance all these activities, the Philippine Legislature appro¬ priated what was, in view of the financial situation at the time, an extravagant sum — one million pesos annually — which could be disbursed with out necessity of pre-audit by the Insular Auditor. The Independence Missions The First Parliamentary Mission was sent to the United States in 1919, the only one during the Democratic Administration of THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 331 Woodrow Wilson. This was a huge delegation, led by Senate President Quezon and Senator Rafael Palma, and consisted of some forty leading Filipinos representing both the Democrata and Nacionalista parties and the various elements of agricultural, commercial, and professional life in the Philippines. The Mission came at a bad time — the War had just ended and of ficials in Washington were more concerned with the problems of political and economic readjustments resulting from the War. Philippine in dependence was thus farthest from their minds. The Mission was received by Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, in the absence of President Wilson, who was in Europe. Baker conveyed to them President Wilson’s reassuring encourage¬ ment in favor of their petition, but there was no commitment to come to a final decision as to Philippine policy. Congres¬ sional committees concerned with Philippine affairs graciously heard the Mission’s petition for in dependence, but the Republican leaders in Congress were unconvinced that the Filipinos were ready for in dependence and announced an in definite postponement of the question of Philippine in dependence “until more convincing proof had been of fered of the ability of the Filipino people to stand alone.” The final action taken by Woodrow Wilson on behalf of the Philippines was a recommendation to Congress in favor of Phil¬ ippine in dependence — the only one he made in the eight years of his presidency, which, not surprisingly, the succeeding Repub¬ lican Administration ignored. Filipino hopes for any action on the Wilson recommendation had dimmed considerably by the time of the in auguration, in March 1921, of Warren G. Harding as President of the United States. Nevertheless, they did not expect that the Republicans, upon coming to power, would propose to reverse the degree of self-government they had achieved under Harrison. Initially there were plans to follow up the first mission with another similar delegation to the Harding Administration, for the Fi¬ lipino leaders wanted to know in 1921 what they were supposed to do to advance to wards in dependence and what the prospects were for the future. But, in stead, Quezon went to Washington [while the Wood-Forbes Mission was conducting its work in the Philippines] as a one-man mission to find out the policy of the new president. Harding assured Quezon that in no case would a backward policy be pursued, that there would be no diminution of domes- 332 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE tic control, that no radical change of legislation was contem¬ plated, and that it was his purpose and desire to make the ad¬ ministration of the Philippines entirely in harmony with their best in terests and in sympathy with their desires as far as possible. The Filipinos took these words as solemn assurances that their political status would not, be altered and it would remain as it had been in Harrison’s time. In April 1922, the Second Parliamentary Mission, led by Quezon and Osmena, went to Washington to present the Filipino viewpoint on the questions raised by the Wood-Forbes Mission Report. The Mission had hoped to counteract the adverse con¬ clusions of the Report and to justify the political autonomy granted the Filipinos by Governor Harrison. But more important¬ ly, it had hoped to get a definitive statement on how and when the Filipinos’ aspirations might be fulfilled, for the Report did not spell these out. President Harding once again assured the Mission that “no backward step is contemplated” but set forth the position that in dependence at the time was out of the question.

President Harding once again assured the Mission that “no backward step is contemplated” but set forth the position that in dependence at the time was out of the question. President Harding’s reply was disappointing to the Mission, but it was not unexpected. After all, while awaiting the Pre¬ sident’s reply, in private conversations with General Frank Mc¬ Intyre, Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Depart¬ ment [which directly supervised Philippine affairs], Quezon and Osmena had let it be known that despite their public utterances, they did not expect any significant change in the status of the Philippines “other than those which might be brought about under the existing or ganic law.” Quezon and Osmena believed that “the people of education and property in the Islands would be satisfied and would for some years discontinue the discussion of in dependence if the government were made in local matters purely Filipino, v: th American control of for eign relations and relations between the United States and the Islands. If to the government so established some name could be given, using, if possible} the word ‘in dependence’ this would for some time sa¬ tisfy the mass of the people who have been fed up on in depend¬ ence talk and who will not be satisfied unless they get that, at least in name.” At their behest, Mc Intyre prepared a draft of such legislation. Acceptance of this act by Quezon and Osmena was condi¬ tion ed upon its not putting them at a political disadvantage in the Philippines. Since no action was taken on this proposed THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 333 measure until 1924, it appears that both the Filipino leaders and the American authorities must have felt at the time that further action would not be prudent. The Second Parliamentary Mission returned in August 1922 with no more than vague assurances that there would be no dimi¬ nution of Filipino control of their government - but no advance in their in dependence plea. The return of this delegation from the United States was followed by an unusual degree of activity in support of in dependence. Confrontation rather than coopera¬ tion came to characterize the relations between the Filipino leadership and Governor Wood after the “Cabinet Crisis” in July 1923. The Independence Commission successively sent in depend¬ ence missions to Washington in 1923,1924, and 1925. To protest the alleged illegal and arbitrary acts of Governor Wood, and specifically to ask for Wood’s relief or for Philippine in dependence, a Special Mission led by the new Speaker of the House, Manuel A. Roxas, left for Washington in November 1923. It presented a memorial listing Filipino grievances against the Governor’s “reactionary and militaristic rule,” which “subverts the moral foundations of the humanitarian wovk so nobly accom¬ plished by America in the Philippines.” President Calvin Coolidge delivered his reply to the memorial in a severe letter dated February 21, 1924. The President’s stand shattered the hopes of the Filipino Mission that the American Government would take measures in the near future to grant the Filipinos their in dependence. Coolidge felt that in spite of the progress made in the Philippines, the Filipinos were as yet un¬ prepared, financially and in other ways, to maintain their in¬ dependence, “for there had not been, thus far, a full realization of the fundamental ideas of democratic self-government.” Coolidge rebuked the Mission members especially for their complaints against Governor Wood. “Looking a+ the whole situa¬ tion fairly and impartially, one cannot but feel that if the Fihpino people cannot cooperate in the support and encouragement of so good an administration as has been afforded under Governor General Wood, their failure will be rather a testimony of un¬ preparedness for the full obligations of citizenship than an evid¬ ence of patriotic eagerness to advance their country.” He assured the Filipinos that the American people would gladly accord them in dependence if it became apparent that it would be good for them “from the point of view of both their domestic concerns 334 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and their status in the world,” but that greater educational, cultural, economic and political advances needed to be made before the Filipinos should undertake the full responsibility for their administration. The Mission was thus rebuffed in its in¬ dependence plea, and more specifically, in its complaints against Governor Wood. The Fairfield Bill President Coolidge’s negative response to the Special Mission did not, at first, blunt a new-found ardor for in dependence on Capitol Hill (US Congress). Bills and resolutions for in dependence from Republicans and Democrats alike had been in troduced be¬ fore in Congress but had seldom even received committee con¬ sideration until the 68 th Congress. Committee hearings were held thrice in this Congress, once each in the House and the Senate on the Cooper and King Bills, and once in the House on the Fairfield Bill to in crease autonomy for the Philippines. In 1924 sentiment was strong in Congress to come to a so¬ lution to the Philippine problem. The congressional hearings revealed that there was a growing feeling that the Filipinos should be given what they said they wanted — immediate in dependence “at any cost” - letting the United States get the problem over with quickly. The Fairfield Bill, an Administration alternative to the in dependence measures, was reported out of committee, and although it was never debated in Congress, it for a time seemed certain to pass.

The Administration, having concluded as hearings on the Cooper and King measures progressed that the situation was get¬ ting out of hand, had decided, in or der to for estall the passage of in dependence legislation, to support a bill granting the Fi¬ lipinos complete in sular autonomy. The Cooper measure having been sidetracked, the Fairfield Bill was in troduced in April 1924 and was rushed through the House Committee on Insular Affairs with unaccustomed speed, being voted out of committee on May 10 th. This was the same bill as prepared by the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1922 at the confidential suggestion of Quezon and Osmena, then in Washington with the Parliamentary Mission. Having sensed the drift in congressional at titudes as early as 1923, the Administration, through General Mc Intyre, had shown the bill to the Special Mission of Speaker Roxas in Decem¬ ber 1923. Roxas, having arrived in Washington only four days THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 335 before, approved the bill in principle, although suggesting the addition of a section which would enable the Filipinos to vote on the question of in dependence after twenty years. The surging tide of in dependence legislation produced a sobering effect on the Filipino leaders. Mc Intyre wrote Governor Wood that “They [the Special Mission] are greatly disturbed... by the enthusiasm with which the plea for immediate and absolute in dependence has been received. They are finding out that the people who are most anxious to give them immediate in depend¬ ence are those in terested in sugar, cigars, etc., in the American market and do not wish to continue the advantages to the Fili¬ pinos which they are now receiving in the American market.” Quezon and Osmena, in Manila, realized that the Roxas Mission had in vited American with drawal. When in dependence at last appeared at tainable, Quezon and Osmena, with Claro M. Recto (Democrata), decided to rush to Washington to oversee the in dependence drive being pushed through Congress. The Parliamentary Mission arrived in Washington in early May after the Fairfield Bill had already been in troduced in Congress and committee hearings were being held. The bill, a precursor to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, pro¬ posed a thirty-year period of autonomy in which the Philippines would have control of in sular affairs, with an elective Governor General for the “Commonwealth of the Philippines.” In its final form, the Fairfield Bill provided for absolute in dependence for the Philippines in 1944, after a twenty-year commonwealth period. In Washington, Quezon and Osmena made only a pro-forma bow in the direction of the Cooper Independence Bill and support¬ ed the Fairfield Bill as the most reasonable legislation they could get from Congress. Though strong opposition was being expressed in the Philippines to the Fairfield Bill, they confidentially advised the Administration that they could get the bill accepted if the Administration would of fer assurances that it would pass Congress. The Administration rejected this scenario, however, stating that Filipino support must precede rather than follow any Adminis¬ tration commitment. Fairfield himself announced that he was unwilling to see the bill passed in the face of Philippine opposi¬ tion, so that Congress recessed with out further action either on this or the in dependence bills. 336 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The Third Parliamentary Mission could easily be considered one of the most distinct of all missions because of the in cidents at tending its return to the Philippines. Shortly after the re¬ turn of the delegation, a bitter struggle ensued between the Nacionalista and Democrata leadership over the Fairfield Bill. Recto, himself a member of the returned Mission, dramatically charged the majority leaders [Quezon, Osmena, and Roxas] with double-dealing and in sincerity in relation to the Fairfield Bill. At Recto’s request, the Mission had unsuspectingly submitted a report signed by the majority leaders, which maintained that they had declined to accept' the Fairfield Bill and had protested the approval by Washington of Governor Wood’s administration in the Philippines. Immediately after the report was read, Recto vigorously denounced the report, declaring that what the majority leaders had done was actually the opposite: they supported the Fairfield Bill and promised cooperation with Governor Wood upon their return. He filed a minority report which charged that the Mission had been unwilling to press for in dependence when the chance was there. Recto’s charges seriously embarrassed the majority leaders, who vehemently in sisted that they did not accept the Fairfield Bill and had demanded immediate in dependence. But there is very little question that Quezon changed his position on the Fairfield Bill only after he discovered that he could not win support for the measure in the Philippines. He had been willing to back off from his radical stand on in dependence if, while doing so, he could still protect his nationalist reputation. The unusual activity in 1923 and 1924 did not advance the in dependence cause, and in sofar as the Governor General was concerned, he was more strongly confirmed in his powers and prerogatives. The re-election of President Coolidge in 1924 ended all prospects for immediate in dependence. Philippine in dependence legislation was shelved by the Coolidge Adminis¬ tration because it felt that the Filipinos’ in terest in in dependence was lacking in depth and sincerity, as the recent events of the Fairfield Bill had shown. The Philippine cause was also greatly hurt by the Filipinos’ continuing opposition to the Governor General.

Philippine in dependence legislation was shelved by the Coolidge Adminis¬ tration because it felt that the Filipinos’ in terest in in dependence was lacking in depth and sincerity, as the recent events of the Fairfield Bill had shown. The Philippine cause was also greatly hurt by the Filipinos’ continuing opposition to the Governor General. After the 1924 Parliamentary Mission, congressional in terest in either: in dependence or in creased autonomy also waned. There was a general feeling in the new Congress that while the aspirations THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 337 for in dependence of the Filipinos were commendable, the agita¬ tion was in reality a demonstration of in gratitude to the United States. Independence could not be considered, anyway, because the task of the United States in the Philippines was far from completed. The Independence Campaign Continues Congressional in terest in Philippine in dependence would not be revived until the Great Depression in 1929. As far as in dependence sentiment in the Philippines was concerned, a peak was reached in 1924, and after the “commotion” brought about by the Fairfield Bill in Manila, the in dependence movement began to lose momentum. Wood thought that the politicos were coming to the conclusion that “they have about reached the end of the road and that they are losing rather than gaining by their at titude of non-cooperation,” What was probably most disconcerting to the Filipino leaders was the realization that the in dependence cause had suffered considerably because of their poor performance in relation to the Fairfield Bill episode. But on top of that, the funding of the in dependence movement was severely curtailed by the decision of the Insular Auditor (an American) in 1924 to disallow the one-million peso appropriation which financed the missions and the publicity bureau in Washington. From this time on, the expenses of the in dependence campaign came from “voluntary” contributions and a smaller appropriation in the Legislature for sending “legislative committees” to the United States. In spite of this discouraging state of affairs, in sular politics dictated that the in dependence campaign had to continue, though there was a marked change in tone. In August 1925, Osmena went as a special envoy to Washington, ostensibly to confer with the Washington government and Congress for the final solution of the Philippine problem. In reality, Osmena went to look into the possibility of some arrangement which would decrease the confrontations with Wood and confirm what the Filipinos claimed were certain commitments made by the Secretary of War in relation to the Fairfield Bill. Osmena found the at mosphere in Washington generally hostile to any movement to wards in creased Philippine autonomy or inde¬ pendence. Washington was in such a bad mood that the Mission decided to adopt an amicable and temperate at titude, working 338 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE quietly and not at tracting at tention. In the opinion of the Admi¬ nistration, the Philippines had not advanced but, in fact, had ret¬ rogressed in political and economic developments, and reaction¬ ary measures in troduced in Congress reflected this opinion. These were measures designed to restrict Philippine autonomy by with¬ drawing political powers already enjoyed by the Filipinos and strengthening the hand of the Governor General. The only achieve¬ ment Osmena took back to Manila with him was the defeat of the reactionary measures which were being considered in Congress. One of those reactionary bills was the Bacon Bill separating Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan from the jurisdiction of the Phil¬ ippine Government and establishing for those regions a separate and distinct form of government directly under American so¬ vereignty. Separation of the Muslim territory from the Philip¬ pine Government had actually been proposed as early as Novem¬ ber 1923, when the American Chamber of Commerce of Mindanao and Sulu proposed that the area be made an unorganized territory under the American flag. But no action had been taken at that time. The measure’s proponents claimed that their sole motive was “to protect these defenseless and unarmed, though proud and self-respecting Moros.” Against the Bacon Bill the Filipinos registered their most vigorous opposition. Some segments of the Filipino population felt that the bill as in spired by the desire to effect a permanent occupation of the Philippines or a separa¬ tion of one of the larger islands for rubber production for Amer¬ ican in terests. Mindanao reportedly, had more than three million hectares of land suitable for rubber cultivation. The Filipinos did not oppose the cultivation of rubber, but they in sisted that for eign capital operate within existing Philippine laws. One of the strongest arguments advanced for the Bacon Bill’s division of the Philippines into a Moro Province and a Christian North was that the Moros the mselves were against in dependence and would prefer to remain under American sovereignty and protection. To be sure, Muslim leaders had, at one time or an¬ other, addressed petitions to the Governor General and to Con¬ gress opposing in dependence for their territory and demanding continuation of American rule. However, it had been possible to secure from as many Muslims petitions proposing just the reverse — showing that they did not want to be separated from the Christian Filipinos, but to receive in dependence with them. 339 THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE Fortunately for the Philippines, the Coolidge Administration did not commit itself to the Bacon Bill, and Congress turned out to be not at all enthusiastic. The Supreme National Council While Osmena was in Washington, Quezon launched the Supreme National Council, uniting all political parties and all segments of Filipino society for an ostensibly more effective and vigorous fight for Philippine in dependence.

The Supreme National Council While Osmena was in Washington, Quezon launched the Supreme National Council, uniting all political parties and all segments of Filipino society for an ostensibly more effective and vigorous fight for Philippine in dependence. There were some, however, who felt that Quezon’s real motives were to strengthen his hold on local affairs and leave him in more or less full control. The scheme of the Supreme National Council was the or etical¬ ly quite impressive. Three objectives were advanced for the Supreme National Council: first, the at traction of substantial Filipinos not heretofore prominent in the in dependence campaign, with the seeming subordination of the politico element which thus far had dominated it; second, the decentralization of the campaign so that the provinces might take an active part, here¬ to fore played only by Manila; and third, an at tempt at the gradual and peaceful use of the political authority vested in the American Governor General and the Philippine Legislature. The or ganizational structure established by the Council paralleled that of the in sular government. National, provincial, and municipal “solidarity committees” were set up through¬ out the country, composed of all elective of ficials in each of these jurisdictions. The Council sought to spread in dependence propaganda to prepare local government for complete in depend¬ ence in every province, town, and village of the Philippines. A closer look would reveal that the Supreme National Council was really the Independence Commission under a different name, with one in teresting exception. The Council tried to play down the role of the politicos in the campaign by in viting non-politicians to participate and the reby giving the appearance of a more nearly unanimous effort. But despite its elaborate structure and the seeming cooperation of various elements, political and otherwise, the Supreme National Council was only of passing moment — before long it destroyed itself through its in ability to reconcile the disparate for ces artificially brought to gether in the name of the “national ideal” of in dependence. 340 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE From 1926 to 1927, concurrently with the for mation and period of major activity of the Supreme National Council, fresh controversies arose between Governor Wood and the Filipino leaders — on the plebiscite bill, the veto power, and the board of control. By June 1927, the general impression was that the Council had little vitality left and by 1928 it had completely faded away. The Plebiscite Controversy Another major disagreement between Governor Wood and the Filipino leaders concerned an in dependence plebiscite bill. The Philippine Legislature in itially passed the bill (Senate Bill 198), providing for a plebiscite on immediate in dependence in early November 1925. Its purpose was to counteract the anti¬ in dependence campaign in the United States premised on the assumption that, except for a small group of self-in terested poli¬ ticians, the Filipino people did not desire in dependence. The plebiscite was in tended to show opponents of Philippine in¬ dependence in the United States that the struggle for national freedom was not confined to a few but was supported by the mass of the Filipino people. The plebiscite was not to be held. The Governor vetoed the bill in December 1925 on the grounds that the calling of a plebiscite was “not a matter within the scope of the legislative power granted under the or ganic act.” The bill was reintroduced and approved by the Philippine Legislature in July 1926. Wood again vetoed the bill, but the Legislature reconsidered and re¬ passed the measure with the concurrence of more than two- thirds of its members. It then went to President Coolidge for final decision. In April 1927, President Coolidge sustained the Governor’s veto of the plebiscite bill in a long message in which he stressed the need for greater economic and political progress before such matters as the holding of an in dependence plebiscite should be at tended to. President Coolidge reviewed the various advantages, especially economic, accruing to the Philippines as a result of the current relationship with the United States, at the same time pointing out the difficulties and problems which would be encountered by an in dependent Philippine government. The result of the vote by the Filipino people would be unconvincing, he advised, for it would not reflect the opinion of those Filipinos THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 341 who wanted in dependence under American protection, or who wanted in dependence after a further period of training and de¬ velopment. He then set down his firm conviction that the people of the Philippines had not as yet at tained the capability of full self-government and that was the ultimate goal which must be at tained not constant agitation and opposition. The message constituted a painful defeat for the Filipino politicians, for it dismissed their campaign for in dependence as mere agitation unworthy of serious at tention. Further, it denied them the one effective means of proving that all Filipinos were united in their demand for in dependence. Once again, Pre¬ sident Coolidge stated clearly the at titude of the American Gov¬ ernment to wards immediate in dependence, at the same time in viting the Filipinos to appreciate what American with drawal from the Philippines would in volve. Insofar as Governor Wood was concerned, the Administration once again supported his action in Manila, and the Filipino leaders’ at tempt to discredit the Governor General had failed again. American Interest Groups “Friends” of Philippine Independence From 1929 on wards, the issues of tariffs and free trade, more specifically of sugar, and immigration, would revive the in depend¬ ence movement and eventually see its consummation.

American Interest Groups “Friends” of Philippine Independence From 1929 on wards, the issues of tariffs and free trade, more specifically of sugar, and immigration, would revive the in depend¬ ence movement and eventually see its consummation. Determina¬ tion of Philippine policy would shift markedly from executive to congressional in itiative as Congress showed greater concern for in creasing popular discontent over the alleged competition of Philippine products and labor. The move to alter the economic relationship between the Philippines and the United States would stimulate, on the part of the Filipinos, a serious effort to change their political status. Agricultural distress, brought about by the Depression, caused various economic in terests in the United States, especially the sugar and farm bloc, to marshall their for ces. They sought, first, to effect tariff revision in their favor, and failing in that, to in duce Congress to set the Philippines free and the reby end the alleged competition of fered by Philippine products and labor. After the defeat of the agriculturists’ at tempt to impose tariffs on Philippine products, they were joined by other in terest groups: labor and extreme “patriotic” groups opposed to Fili¬ pino immigration; isolationists anxious about the Japanese menace in Asia; and anti-imperialists who felt America’s mission in the Philippines had been accomplished. 342 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Economic-commercial relations between the Philippines and the United States were based on free trade, “the only develop¬ ment al policy” implemented in the Philippines during the Amer¬ ican colonial period. The Payne-Aldrich Act of 1909 established two-way free trade except for generous quotas on sugar and to¬ bacco. In 1913, under the Underwood-Simons Act, the Wilson Administration removed all quota limitations on Philippine products and complete free trade was established (except for a proviso that Philippine manufactured articles exported to the United States free of duty should not contain for eign materials to a value of more than 20%); The natural result of the free trade policy was to bind the Philippine closer to the United States economically while it gave a great stimulus to the production of export commodities that found a profitable market in the United States, like sugar, copra and coconut oil, abaca or hemp, and to bacco. This trade growth supported modest economic development in the Philip¬ pines. Officially, many leading Filipinos in th° Philippine Assembly (the legislative body) had protested vigorously against free trade, suggesting that the reduction in revenues from the elimination of customs duties would make it “impossible to sustain the burdens and services of the Insular Government.” They had also voiced opposition to the long-term implications of Philippine American trade relations, which “would be highly prejudicial to the economic in terests of the Philippine people and would create a situation which might delay the obtaining of its in¬ dependence.” There is considerable evidence to suggest, however, that in private, Filipino leaders actually welcomed free trade, con¬ vinced that they had much to gain from such an economic arrange¬ ment. The main reason for their public opposition, it was re¬ cently alleged by a Filipino historian, was to ensure that Amer¬ icans understood that they would not welcome significant in vest¬ ments of American capital, especially in agriculture, which they hoped to keep to the mselves. American agricultural in terests, from the beginning, found free trade undesirable, for they viewed the unlimited free entry of Philippine products into the United States as a menace to their own products. During the 1920 s Philippine agriculture enjoyed unprecedented expansion due to the stimulation provided THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 343 by the post-war boom and even more favorable tariff preferences resulting from in creased duties on non-Philippine sugar and copra imports after 1922. Unhappily, however, Philippine agricultural prosperity was not shared by American farmers. Depression had hit American farmers in 1921 and again in 1926. The world sugar market had been slumping since 1925. The conviction that Philippine imports constituted a “menace” resulted in aggressive agitation for tariff revision in favor of American farmers, particularly with the on set of the Depression in 1929. Hard-pressed agricultural groups demanded that Congress alleviate their desperate situation by relieving them of the burden of Philippine competition. If their problem could not be solved on a tariff basis, the farmers wanted Philippine in dependence. Concurrently with the renewed at tention to possible Philip¬ pine in dependence, Filipino immigration to the United States became a contentious issue. The steady in flux of Filipino laborers to the Pacific Coast states, principally California, where from time to time riots had occurred over labor troubles, had led the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and other extreme “pa¬ triotic” societies to propose that the exclusion laws applicable to other Asians be applied to the Filipinos, who were free to enter the United States as they wished. The AFL had been opposed to the retention of the Philip¬ pines, having denounced it as a policy of imperialism departing from the time-honored traditions of the United States. After 1926, when heavy Filipino immigration began, the AFL became chiefly concerned with the problem of Filipino immigrant labor competition, and the race problem it would create. It urged support for a policy of complete and immediate exclusion"

After 1926, when heavy Filipino immigration began, the AFL became chiefly concerned with the problem of Filipino immigrant labor competition, and the race problem it would create. It urged support for a policy of complete and immediate exclusion. In 1929 the AFL argued that exclusion was also highly desirable on the grounds of public health, since “upon the authority of health of ficials it is declared that the mode and conditions of life in the Philippines tend to destroy the vitality and stamina of these people, making them easy victims of various contagious diseases, as evidenced by the recent epidemic of spinal meningitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.” Filipino exclusion was also justified on the ground that Fili¬ pinos were the least assimilable or least desirable as additions to the racial composition of the American population, predo- 344 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PFOPLE minantly of Caucasian stock. Implied in this non-assimilability assertion was racism that treated the American national character like a “prized recipe” to be preserved in its exact ethnic com¬ ponents. Filipino immigrants, it was advanced, would not only endanger the economic status of American workers, but would also destroy the cultural traditions of the country and the character of its people. Free Trade and Independence The tariff agitation in Congress, particularly with its zeroing in on Philippine products entering the United States under pre¬ ferential arrangements, seriously distressed the Filipino leaders. As the thought began to sink in that, perhaps, due to the economic situation in the United States tariffs might be restored on Philip¬ pine products, and conceivably, in dependence might suddenly be granted, the Filipinos showed in creasing hesitation to accept it. Although it was displayed only privately, the leaders evidenced a notable cooling off of their enthusiasm for immediate in depend¬ ence. The tariff agitation brought home to them for the first time the value of the American market and the fact that in¬ dependence would mean the loss of that market. Quezon, in fact, thought that the tariff issue was probably the greatest crisis that the Philippines had met with since the American occupation. The general public at titude was still that no matter what the cost, the sacrifice was one they were willing to make. Private¬ ly, many were saying that it would be only fair if the actual date of in dependence were postponed, but with the question being definitely settled in the meantime. Opinion became steadily more favorable to the idea of a twenty-or-thirty-year in terval of preparation, with additional autonomy during the in termediate period and in dependence at the end of that time. But publicly, the political leaders were still very cautious about expressing any revised opinions on in dependence, and the demand was still for “immediate, absolute, and complete in dependence.” From 1929 to 1934, there was an almost continuous presence of Filipino representatives in Washington to steer the in depend¬ ence movement. From March to October 1929, Roxas and Os- rneha were in Washington as a legislative committee to present the Philippine case on the threatened legislation affecting the free entry of Philippine products into the United States. Before the return of this mission in October 1929, in anticipation of the discussions on Philippine in dependence in the for thcoming session THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 345 of Congress in December 1929, a new mission had already been decided upon. This delegation left in December, chaired again by Roxas, and assisted by House Majority Floor Leader Manuel C. Briones and two Democrata leaders, Pedro Gil and Juan Sumu- long. They returned to Manila in September 1930. Quezon left Manila for Washington in August 1930, but he did not make it to Washington until May 1931 because of illness. Upon his return in October 1931, he recommended the dispatch of another mission, and the Os Rox Mission left in December 1931. Quezon led a “Mixed Mission” in March 1933 and a Joint Legisla¬ tive Committee in November 1933. Hearings on Philippine in dependence were begun on January 15, 1930 and continued in termittently for several sessions, focus¬ ing on the Hawes-Cutting Bill. The congressional hearings made it plain that immediate in dependence would not be granted by Congress. Passage of in dependence legislation in the near future would be possible only if the plan provided for a tran¬ sition period before the declaration of an in dependent govern¬ ment. Such a course fitted the predilection of many Filipino leaders for a slower approach to in dependence at this time. Out¬ wardly, there was, however, little let-up in the demand for im¬ mediate in dependence. After Quezon returned from the United States in November, he made a subtle bid to generate support for a plan providing for dominion status under an autonomous government, ten years of free trade, immigration restrictions, and a plebiscite at the end of ten years to decide on in dependence. Quezon in dicated, in describing his plan, one of three alternatives he proposed, that it stood the best chance of of ficial acceptance by Washington, and he was simply trying “to harmonize the people’s high ideals with the circumstances.” But there developed little support in the Philippines for his proposed solution. The Os Rox Mission, 1931-1933 In December 1931, Osmena and Roxas left for the United States as the Os Rox Mission to secure what in their judgment would be the best out of any situation that might arise in Con¬ gress concerning the Philippine issue. After some thirty-odd years of in dependence agitation, the Os Rox Mission, which stayed the longest in the United States [until 1933], succeeded in securing the passage of an in dependence bill — the controversial 346 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act — over the veto of President Hoover.

The Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act became law on January 17, 1933. The Act provided for the establishment of a ten-year Com¬ monwealth to serve as a transition government before the procla¬ mation of in dependence on July 4, 1946. The plebiscite clause was eliminated, but the measure would be submitted to the Legislature for approval. Limits on duty-free sugar, coconut oil, and cordage would be 800,000 long tons of raw sugar, 50,000 long tons of refined sugar, 200,000 long tons of coconut oil, and 3,000,000 pounds of cordage... Beginning in the sixth year of the ten-year transition period, a graduated export tax would be imposed, the proceeds of which would be applied to the li¬ quidation of Philippine bonds. A constitutional convention would be called to draft a constitution which would have to provide for certain stated limitations on autonomy (the President of the United States to have the power to approve or disapprove all constitutional amendments and to control bonded in debted¬ ness, currency, and for eign affairs) and would have to be sub¬ mitted to the President for approval. After the constitution was approved, the President would call for an election of the of ficials of the Philippine Commonwealth. After the transition period, in dependence would become effective but the United States would reserve commercial, military, and naval bases in the Philip¬ pines, although the President was also requested in the bill to negotiate treaties with for eign governments for the neutraliza¬ tion of the Philippines. Full United States tariffs would apply after the ten-year transition period. The passage of an in dependence bill, its veto by President Hoover, and its subsequent repassage, should have been the most dramatic event in the history of the Filipino campaign for in dependence. For the Os Rox Mission finally came back with a definite program that would positively pave the way for in dependence. But October 1933 was an even more dramatic event — when the Filipinos rejected the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, and Quezon parted ways with Osmena and Roxas. Perhaps the event was not unexpected, for by carefully follow¬ ing the trend of events from the departure of the Mission in December 1931 through the congressional action on the inde¬ pendence bill in January 1933, it was possible to perceive the gradual parting of the ways between Quezon in Manila (who stayed behind due to illness) and the Mission in Washington. A collision course developed between the two political for ces as THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 347 each side tried to reconcile divergent views and sway the other by a lavish use of cable and radio. Osmena and Roxas considered the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act the best that could be secured from Congress. Quezon disagreed. Quezon was sincerely dubious about some of the terms of inde¬ pendence of fered by the bill and was hopeful that the in coming Democratic Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt would be able to bring about a more favorable bill. But he was more im¬ mediately concerned that Osmena and Roxas not achieve their goal of finally settling the Philippines issue. Realizing that the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill was all that could be secured from Congress at this time, Quezon shifted his strategy to Manila, where he caused the Philippine Legislature to reject the bill and thus also to repudiate the leadership of Osmena and Roxas. In declining to accept the bill, the Legislature presented the following reasons: (1) the provisions affecting trade relations between the United States and the Philippines would seriously imperil the economic, social, and political in stitutions of the country and might defeat the avowed purpose to secure in depend¬ ence for the Philippines at the end of the transition period; (2) the immigration clause was objectionable and of fensive to the Filipino people; (3) the powers of the High Commissioner were too in definite; and (4) the military, naval, and other reservations provided for in the act were in consistent with true in dependence, violated dignity and were subject to misunderstanding. In November 1933, Quezon left for the United States as head of a joint legislative committee for the purpose of securing a better in dependence bill for the Philippines. This he was unable to do — all that he secured was a face-saving re-run of the Hare- Hawes-Cutting Act under a different name — as the Tydings- Mc Duffie Act — but the important thing was that Quezon brought it home and he was acclaimed the hero of his people. In the final analysis, what was more significant was not which of the two in dependence bills was enacted, but who secured in depend¬ ence for the Filipino people. On May 1, 1934, the Philippine Legislature unanimously accepted the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, which eliminated provisions fcr military reservations and substituted a provision for “ultimate settlement” as to naval bases and fueling stations. The for mal approval of in dependence in 1934 was a unique event in the history of colonialism, yet in the Philippine-American 348 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE context it was much delayed. The Clarke Amendment to the Jones Act of 1916 would have allowed the President of the United States to fix a date for the granting of Philippine in depend¬ ence, from two to four years from the passage of the bill, and the Senate actually approved the amendment. It was blocked in the House only by a small margin. Had it passed, it would have bestowed in dependence by 1920, at the latest"

In the final analysis, what was more significant was not which of the two in dependence bills was enacted, but who secured in depend¬ ence for the Filipino people. On May 1, 1934, the Philippine Legislature unanimously accepted the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, which eliminated provisions fcr military reservations and substituted a provision for “ultimate settlement” as to naval bases and fueling stations. The for mal approval of in dependence in 1934 was a unique event in the history of colonialism, yet in the Philippine-American 348 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE context it was much delayed. The Clarke Amendment to the Jones Act of 1916 would have allowed the President of the United States to fix a date for the granting of Philippine in depend¬ ence, from two to four years from the passage of the bill, and the Senate actually approved the amendment. It was blocked in the House only by a small margin. Had it passed, it would have bestowed in dependence by 1920, at the latest. Although the Jones Act in its final form advanced Philip¬ pine autonomy, it left the issue of Philippine in dependence for some future date: “as soon as a stable government can be estab¬ lished.” The future date for in dependence was very nearly deter¬ mined in 1924. In that year a House Committee would have reported the Cooper Resolution providing for in dependence in 1926 if administration maneuvers had not side tracked the meas¬ ure. There was a strong probability that had the bill come to a vote, it would have been approved. The Coolidge Administra¬ tion as a last resort in spired in troduction of the Fairfield Bill, of fering Philippine autonomy, as a compromise measure to head off in dependence. In 1934, the United States was the first nation to voluntarily relinquish sovereignty over a colony after a little over a generation of tutelage. Like her contemporary sovereign powers, the United States acquired the Philippines partly for power and glory: be¬ cause of the desire to expand American trade in Asia and to play a role in Pacific power politics. But there was also much idealism in American imperialism. The United States wanted to duplicate in the Philippines her ideals of democratic self-rule and to build the Filipino nation into a true democracy. The United States would play the role of an understanding tutor, administering the affairs of the Filipinos for their benefit, and by a process of ever-in creasing self-government, prepare them for in dependence in the future. So the United States took concrete actions to prepare the Filipinos for in dependence. As early as 1901 the Filipinos were allowed to assume elective positions in the municipal and provincial governments. A Fili¬ pino was appointed Chief Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court in 1901, and by 1907 when the Philippine Assembly was in augurated, prominent Filipinos ilustrados were sitting in both the executive and legislative branches of the in sular government. In 1916 an all-Filipino bicameral legislature had replaced the Philippine Assembly, and by 1934 the Philippine Government THE CAMPAIGN FOR INDEPENDENCE 349 was very nearly in Filipino hands, except for the positions of the Governor General, the Vice-Governor, the Insular Auditor, and other top positions reserved for Americans. An educational system was likewise set up, quite unlike other systems in other colonized countries. The American ideal of education as a value in itself and an avenue of social mobility was accepted enthusiastically by the Filipinos. Education was for the masses, not merely for a colonial elite, with access to quality education available at all levels. The opportunities for political participation and education provided the Filipinos with the to ols and training necessary for self-government. For all the faults and self-in terestedness which manifested the mselves on the road to in dependence, the starting point had been unique. The appeal for in dependence of the Filipinos was consistently opposed by the Washington authorities, who held the view that in dependence was merely a matter of the heart — “a mistaken emotionalism” — for which the Filipinos were not prepared. The sentiment, they believed, had been fostered by the political leaders who came into power by its use, and who, having stimula¬ ted the desire for freedom, could not drop the demand. The dif¬ ference between the politicos’ public declarations and their private sentiments vexed Washington authorities, who felt that in dependence was not the real desire of the Filipino leadership. Quezon was, however, consistent in wanting the reality of in dependence, if in dependence was defined as the ability of the Filipinos to manage their own affairs with out in terference from the United States. The Filipinos wanted to control their own destiny. Quezon was genuinely concerned with the future well¬ being of the nation he expected to lead to in dependence. In bucking away from demagoguery and the pursuit of in dependence when it could have been obtained, he clearly was placing long- range goals ahead of the short-term approbation which immediate in dependence would have achieved for him. Thus he appeared to be saying one thing in public and another thing in private. The in dependence leaders have been faulted for thinking almost exclusively in political terms — i. e., political in dependence from the United States — and ignoring almost entirely the re¬ structuring of society to eliminate the socio-economic in equities which have oppressed the masses of Filipinos. In approaching 350 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE this issue, one must guard against the temptation to apply present- day moral values to the social milieu of the 1930 s. It seems clear that settling the political issue was the logical first step to the assertion of nationhood. Certainly, also, there were tre¬ mendous competing needs in many fields — education, health and sanitation, road-building — whose undeniable contribution to social betterment is to day taken for granted in the Philippines because of achievements in the pre-in dependence period. Some of the leaders did demonstrate concern for social improvements in these and other more contemporary areas during the short Commonwealth period. But at the same time, preoccupation with the in dependence issue was politically compelling.

Whatever the circumstances and motivations, in dependence came to the Philippines as the result of a peaceful political process and the at tainment of'j in dependence through prolonged parlia¬ ment ary process in fluenced Philippine political developments profoundly. 19 TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH On May 1,1934, when the Philippine Legislature unanimously accepted the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, Manuel L. Quezon had a sobering admonition to his people. He said:... we have taken one more step for ward in our on ward march to the realization of our national ideal... In this solemn moment, let there be no exultation of victory. Let it be a moment of consecration.” Governing was now almost entirely a Filipino responsibility and Quezon must have taken stock of the conditions of the country and the people and realized that much work had not been done and much awaited the transition to in dependence. The Framing of the Constitution In accordance with the provisions of the in dependence act, the Filipinos, on July 10, 1934, elected 202 delegations to a constitutional convention tasked with the drafting of a Philip¬ pine constitution. Meeting in in augural convention on July 30, the following were elected as of ficials of the constitutional con¬ vention: Claro M. Recto, president; Ruperto Montinola, first vice-president; Teodoro Sandiko, second vice-president; and Narciso Pimental, secretary. Forty committees were or ganized to study and report on the provisions of the constitution. A sub¬ committee of seven — the “seven wise men”.— prepared a draft of the constitution. They were Filemon Sotto, chairman, and Norberto Romualdez, Manuel Roxas, Vicente Singson Encarna- cion, Manuel C. Briones, Miguel Cuademo, and Conrado Benitez (who replaced Jose P. Laurel). The Philippine Constitution followed the American model in structure and'for mal appearance, except for a unicameral legislature and a unitary (as against a federal) system of govern¬ ment. The framers of the constitution were beneficiaries of the American system of education and were, the refore, familiar with American political concepts of democracy and government. Nevertheless, the constitution reflected the historical experience of the Filipinos and in cluded provisions such as the separation of church and state, and limitation on the size of agricultural lands to be owned by private in dividuals or corporations. The 351 352 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Constitution also reflected certain cultural values unique in the Philippine tradition, such as the principle of state supremacy over the in dividual and the exaltation of authority. There were, thus, provisions for compulsory civil or military service and declarations to or ient youth to wards the ideals of civil efficiency. The state was empowered to own and operate public utilities and enterprises and to regulate all employment relationships. The Constitution also vested extraordinary constitutional powers in the President, in cluding an item veto over appropriation, revenue, and tariff bills and conditional powers over trade and tariff. “In times of war or other national emergency,” Congress could authorize him limitless critical powers. Historian Theodore Friend quoted one observer who thought the Philippine consti¬ tution “flexible enough to accommodate everything from a representative republic to a temporary but renewable dictator¬ ship.” Another observer thought that the likely scenario in the Philippines would be “an irresponsible autocracy, with power concentrated in the President, the Speaker, and to a much lesser degree, in a few of their in timate political associates.” The constitutional convention approved the constitution on February 8, 1935 and President Roosevelt did the same on March 23. A plebiscite held on May 14, 1935 ratified the consti¬ tution. In September, a re-united Nacionalista Party (composed of the Quezon and Osmena-Roxas factions) won overwhelmingly over its rivals — General Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay. On Friday, November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was in augurated with Manuel L. Quezon as President and Sergio Osmena as Vice-President, at a time when the Italians were bombing Ethiopia, the Japanese were in vading China, and Hitler had risen to power with the Third Reich. Dressed in cut¬ away vest and top hat, Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmena, along with 98 members of the unicameral National Assembly, were sworn into of fice amidst a crowd of about half a million people packed at the Sunken Garden. \\,. In ten more years the birth of the nation would become a reality, and in dependence would be recognized.

On the night of May 2-3, 1935, 65,000 partially armed peasants shattered the tranquility of the countryside surrounding Manila.

On the night of May 2-3, 1935, 65,000 partially armed peasants shattered the tranquility of the countryside surrounding Manila. Between sunset and sunrise, peasant bands seized three communities and threatened ten others in Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite. Throughout the night, the confused situation escalated. Hard-pressed Consta¬ bulary units from the provinces and Manila fought with Sak- dalistas equipped with a motley array of weapons. There were persistent reports of an impending at tack on Manila and recurrent and disturbing rumors of Japanese aircraft bringing in arms and ammunitions for the rebels. Starting as an anti-Quezon, anti- Nacionalista crusade, the Sakdalistas’ fiery leader, Benigno Ramos, became the persecuted spokesman for the oppressed masses. The Sakdalistas or ganized their appeal around issues which had tremendous appeal to the peasants. They accused the Nacio- nalistas of hypocrisy on the issue of in dependence and promised that Ramos would acquire “complete and absolute” in dependence for the Philippines by December 31, 1935. They also promised that the Sakdal Party would abolish all taxes when it acquired control of the government. Denouncing caciquism, they called for equal or common ownership of land and proclaimed that all large holdings would be divided and distributed to the poor. They also at tacked the religious or ders for operating vast estates and amassing wealth “through dishonest means.” The Sakdal uprising demonstrated the extent of discontent in the provinces and the effectiveness of Sakdal appeal to address giievances which had plagued the common tao for generations. In fact, peasant and labor unrest had manifested the mselves in a new upsurge in the twenties in the face of grinding poverty, high taxes, usury, oppressive treatment by caciques, land-grabbing, fraudulent titling and other legel tricks employed by the rich and the powerful. Movements led by self-styled me^siahs, secret societies in the revolutionary tradition, and old or ganizations such as the pulahanes and colorums erupted not only in Luzon but also in the Visayas and in Mindanao. Such were the Colorums } 354 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of Surigao in 1923, Florencio Intrencherado in the Visayas in 1927, and the Colorums in Tayug, Pangasinan in 1931. While for the most part American of ficials and Filipino politicians contemptuously dismissed them as fanatical movements or plain banditry, these movements reflected peasant grievances and aspirations. Eventually militant peasant and workers’ or ganizations arti¬ culated the grievances of the oppressed and downtrodden major¬ ity who were mobilized for collective action. Labor and peasant or ganizations were radicalized through exposure to in ternational or ganizations of the Left. The Communist Party of the Philip¬ pines was for mally established on November 7, 1930, but by 1932, it had been declared an illegal or ganization, thus ending the legal life of the CPP. Sakdalism exerted a profound in fluence over the course of Commonwealth affairs. Its tragic demise caused much soul- searching among Filipinos. While in itially Nacionalista spokes¬ men minimized the significance of the movement by tracing it to demagogues, racketeers, and religious fanatics, a few prominent people in government pointed to socio-economic factors as the root cause of discontent and the need to in stitute reforms to improve the peasants’ life. Quezon’s primary concern as the first president of his coun¬ try experimenting with a transition period of self-rule prior to complete in dependence in 1946, was to lay a secure foundation for a new Philippines. He sought the for mulation of policies to ensure the security and well-being of all Filipinos, as well as the adjustment of the national economy to face the challenge of in dependence. The programs he adopted, specifically with regard to social justice, education, and the economy, were expected to provide for domestic stability through the creation of a more equitable society. He said: “... We shall build a government that will be just, honest, efficient and strong [to] satisfy not only the passing needs of the hour but also the exacting demands of the ftiture.” National Security and National Defense & To underscore the urgency of providing an adequate defense system for an in dependent Philippines, the National Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 1 — the National Defense Act. To set up the Philippine defense system President Quezon secured TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 355 the services of General Douglas Mac Arthur, retired Chief of Staff of the US Army, on whom he conferred the title of Field Marshal of the Philippine Army. The defense plan envisioned or ganization of a citizen army to consist of two components: a regular force of about 10,000 men, in cluding the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and a reserve force to number 400,000 by the end of the ten-year period through a continuous program of training 21-year old able-bodied men for a period of 5 V 6 months. To supplement the regular training program, preparatory military training (PMT) would be given in the elementary, high school and college levels. The defense plan also in cluded the establishment of a modest Philippine navy to consist of 50-100 to rpedo boats to be used primarily for off-shore patrol. An Army Air Corps would be composed of a fleet of fast bomber planes. The defense plan was not fully realized by the time war came to the Philippines. Budgetary constraints and the urgency of other important con¬ cerns, such as education, health and public works, necessarily limited the capacity of General Mac Arthur to see his program through.

The Social Justice Program Perhaps no other Commonwealth policy has received as much at tention, curiosity, and even, criticism, as Quezon’s social justice program. The Constitution of 1935 mandated that “the pro¬ motion of social justice to in sure the well-being and economic security of all the people should be the concern of the state.” Social justice was equated with justice to the common man. This meant the improvement of the lot of the tao by emancipating him from those conditions that make it possible for the rich and powerful to take advantage of him. This was to be achieved by protecting the tao from exploitation by seeing to it that he got what was rightly due him — fair treatment, proper living and working conditions, and just compensation for his labors. In the light of the Sakdal uprising, Quezon had to commit himself and his Nacionalista Party to a platform that emphasized justice for the tao. “If we are just to our people, we will be free from in ternal rebellion,” he had been heard to say. He saw clearly the contentment of the tao as the first in surance against social and political disorders. Quezon was blessed with a few for tuitous circumstances in in itiating his social justice program. He had the support of a 356 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE subservient National Assembly, although he had to coerce certain opponents. Through the Assembly, Quezon was able to obtain necessary legislation, and through executive or ders and procla¬ mations, he or ganized advisory and administrative bodies, councils and courts that were necessary to handle problems as they arose. On two important fronts, reforms were in stituted: labor and tenancy. Commonwealth Act No. 211 (November 1936) established a minimum wage for laborers employed in public works projects. (This was PI.00 a day, the amount subsequently raised to PI.25.) The eight-hour labor law was also passed, ap¬ plicable to persons employed in any public or private in dustry or occupation. Commonwealth Act No. 213 sought to recognize, define, and regulate legitimate labor disputes and a Court of Industrial Relations was established to settle between employers and laborers questions in volving hours of labor, minimum wages, working conditions and other matters affecting their relations. On the tenancy front, it was part of Quezon’s social justice program that some kind of land reform be started. He planned that the big estates would disappear within 15 to 20 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and the tillers of the soil would subsequently own the lands they cultivated. Quezon lamented the fact that “The men and women who till the soil and work in the factories are hardly better off now than they were during the Spanish regime.” Quezon, however, emphasized that social justice required that the government respect the right of owners to their property and that of the landed to their land; it could not wrest those lands away from their legal owners for sale to the workers with out due payment. Realizing that urgent reforms were needed in the rice and sugar sectors of the economy, the National Rice and Com Cor¬ poration was created in December 1935 to stabilize the price of rice with the aim of protecting producer and consumer and to serve as an agency of the government to meet local or national emergencies in case of a rice shortage. A National Sugar Board was likewise created to conduct a survey of the sugar in dustry and to assist the government in its efforts to solve the social problems confronting the country. To avert the possibility of the monopoly of land by a few, an Agricultural and Industrial Bank and farmers cooperatives were established to afford easier terms in applying for and acquiring homesteads and other farm lands. The government believed that it should not stop at the TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 357 sale of lands but should continue to extend a helping hana so that kasamas, usually unlettered, who hitherto had to depend on their landlords for many advances, for advice and guidance,. light have an agency to take the place of the for mer landlords. Quezon was also able to lease haciendas from their owners for a period not exceeding 25 years, with an option for tenants to purchase the land during that period, for a specified price. These pro¬ jects were undertaken in Cagayan, Bohol, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija and Pampanga, areas prone to agrarian restiveness. Realizing that in times of calamities the unemployed and in digent suffered the most, the National Relief Administration was created (January 1938) to coordinate under its sole manage¬ ment the different relief activities of the government with those being undertaken by private relief in stitutions. The success of Quezon’s admittedly far-reaching and humane policies was limited by the availability of funds, clashes between capital and labor, and difficulties in the enforcement of laws. Parliamentary victories in Manila did not add up to alleviation of misery in the to wns and barrios. Provincial governors and local authorities blocked the application of social justice. Quezon’s persistent and determined efforts notwithstanding, effective means for implementing the program at the barrio level were never at tained. Much of Quezon’s difficulty came from cacique determina¬ tions to maintain the status quo. Caciques, fearing that their days of power and wealth were numbered, or ganized landlord associa¬ tions (like Batung Maputi in Pampanga in the late 20 s), private armies and cooperative efforts to restrict the activities of peasant movements (for example, the National Volunteers or ganized by the Governor of Cavite and Carnal ning Capayapaan or ganized by the Governor of Pampanga).

Provincial councils passed laws to restrict peasant political activity and hacenderos did everything in their power to strengthen municipal law enforcement agencies in their favor. The tenancy problem threatened to undermine the entire social structure. It v~s not the number of tenants, which had doubled by 1935, but the conditions of tenancy that mattered. The tenancy law governing tenant-landlord relations could be circumvented by a loophole provision that the law would take effect only when the municipal council passed a resolution making 358 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE it applicable in that municipality. Only then could the President promulgate its application in that municipality. Members of the municipal councils were the mselves landlords or political proteges of landlords. Thus the law was rendered in effective and there was little done to improve the living and working conditions of the tenants tied to their landlords in oppressive feudal relations. On the labor front, the Department of Labor was always short of personnel during much of the Commonwealth that it found itself unable to make the necessary in spection of mines and factories to in sure safety regulations. There were also flagrant exploitation of child labor. The Labor Arbitration Act was self-defeating and impotent as conflicting parties were unable to enter into peaceful arbitration of disputes. Quezon’s social justice program had its pitfalls due to the contradictions between the ory and practice. Absentee land¬ lords and abusive administrators made a mockerly of laws seeking to alleviate the lot of the peasants and tenants. Quezon’s govern¬ ment was of ten for ced to make a choice between the in terests of capital and those of labor. Quezon was sympathetic to the needs and aspirations of those who worked for a living but he was also prey to the in fluence of powerful blocs. His Cabinet and the Legislature were hacendero-dominated, and Quezon’s reliance upon extremely conservative men of wealth to support his party and personal projects limited his social justice pro¬ gram. He was unable to win for his enlightened policies a major¬ ity of those who wielded economic and political power. In general, the social justice program did not prove an out¬ standing success as it depended almost entirely on the personality of Quezon. There was no guarantee that his successors would continue to pursue the program or thwart its aims. Quezon’s efforts varied from the enactment of various laws, the creation of government agencies, the enforcement of a minimum daily wage in public works projects, and the creation of the Rural Progress Administration (in March 1939). What he sought was to improve the lot of the masses of Filipinos to correct the in jus¬ tices they have suffered through the years. The actual results were meager. He lacked enough money and a sufficiently honest and in dependent civil service to counteract the means of sabotage used by the powerful landed and sectional in terests against his social justice program. By 1940, the whole of Central Luzon was in turmoil — there was widespread peasant unrest there and in the Visayas and TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 359 activist peasant or ganizations demanded relief from feudal con¬ ditions of share tenancy, usury, and deprivation of civil and poli¬ tical rights. The provincial at mosphere was heavy with class tension in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor, with caciques or ganizing private armies in efforts to restrict the activities of peasant movements and agrarian leaders seeking more effective means to or ganize the rural population. Education during the Commonwealth Social justice was also linked to the need to improve the skills, productivity and development of the human resources of the nation. This could be achieved through the development of a system of education that would be available to the largest number of Filipinos. The Commonwealth government placed a high premium on the promotion of democratization of educa¬ tion al opportunities, working on the assumption that education of the citizenry was crucial in the success of democratic self- government in the Philippines. Thus Quezon emphasized that one of his goals would be to eradicate illiteracy by giving every Filipino child at least a modem elementary education so that in time a body of trained and educated citizens might provide the leadership of the future na¬ tion. To overseer the reform of the educational system to make it better conform to the requirements of their new political status and the future of the country, a National Council of Edu¬ cation was created in 1936, chaired by Rafael Palma, and Vice President Osmena headed the Department of Education, the first time a Filipino assumed that position. The main emphasis during the early years of the Commonwealth was on primary and adult education. With the elimination of the seventh grade and the in stitution of a double-single session, enrollment in the pri¬ mary schools in creased. The objective of universal primary education was not at¬ tained. The rate of population in crease just could not keep up with the facilities. In 1935, 1,229,242 children were en¬ rolled in public schools; in 1939, 1,961,861 were enrolled. Only 45% of children of school age were enrolled in public schools.

      "context": ". The main emphasis during the early years of the Commonwealth was on primary and adult education. With the elimination of the seventh grade and the in stitution of a double-single session, enrollment in the pri¬ mary schools in creased. The objective of universal primary education was not at¬ tained. The rate of population in crease just could not keep up with the facilities. In 1935, 1,229,242 children were en¬ rolled in public schools; in 1939, 1,961,861 were enrolled. Only 45% of children of school age were enrolled in public schools. Another aspect of educational policy was the relation of the school curriculum to national needs. In 1938, the Bureau of Education started a program of publishing basic texts in 360 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPI E language and reading for all elementary grades. The idea was to produce textbooks better adapted to the in terests of the Filipino child — “more in terpretive of the national spirit and the desires of the people.” By 1940, Quezon realized that the system of elementary in struction in the schools had yet to be adapted to the needs of Filipino society. A great deal of money had been spent with out producing tangible results, with Filipinos coming out of the schools practically illiterate. The National Assembly thus embarked upon a complete revision of the public elementary school system and in stitutionalized the principle of universal compulsory education through the primary grades. Aside from stressing the equality of opportunity in educa¬ tion as one of its goals, the Commonwealth government also used the schools to produce skills and dignify labor. All school children were required to take some vocational courses that required them to work with their hands — basket-making, car¬ pentry, blacksmithing, gardening, raising stock, sewing, cooking, housekeeping, etc. In addition there were farm settlement schools, agricultural high schools, trade and rural high schools, and event¬ ually, a school of arts and trades and a nautical school. In general vocational schools did not become popular as most Filipino families preferred academic schooling for two reasons: first, the difficulty of finding employment in the vocations; and, second, because manual labor, even of the skilled varities, was not held in high esteem. The Commonwealth government also provided for adult education. In 1939, nearly V 2 of the population over 10-years of age were reported illiterate. The objectives of adult education, supervised by the Office of Adult Education of the Department of Public Instruction, were to eliminate illiteracy and to give vocational and citizenship training. By 1940, more than 6,000 adult schools had been established, manned by some 50,000 volunteers devoted to the campaign against illiteracy. Quezon’s dream of building a literate society was realized in parts of the country (by 1938, literacy was measured at 48.8% for children aged 10 and above; in Manila, 80.7% of the people were reported literate), but the hope of eradicating poverty through education was unfulfilled. There were not enough schools to accommodate everyone, and not all those who made it through the elementary grades made it to high school. Children of lower in come groups could not always afford the cost of education. TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 361 especially in the private schools which were mostly church- managed. Strangely, too, the in crease in the number of educa¬ tion al in stitutions of fering higher education was accompanied by a corresponding decline in the quality of education. The National Language Article 2 of the Constitution directed the National Assembly to “take steps to ward the development and adoption of a com¬ mon language based on one of the existing native languages.” Quezon thought that a national language would foster national unity and national identity. On November 13, 1936, the Na¬ tion al Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 184 establish¬ ing the Institute of National Language tasked to study the dif¬ ferent Philippine languages for the purpose of evolving and adopt¬ ing a national language. On November 9, 1937, after serious consideration, the Institute of National Language recommended the adoption of Tagalog as the basis of the national language. On December 30, Quezon proclaimed the language based on Tagalog as the coun¬ try's national language. In April 1940, Quezon authorized the printing of a dictionary and grammar prepared by the Institute. Beginning on June 19, 1940, the national language was or dered taught in all schools in the Philippines. Through Commonwealth Act No. 570, the National Assembly declared that the Tagalog- based national language would become one of the of ficial lan¬ guages of the country effective upon in dependence on July 4, 1946. Economic Development The other major concern of the Commonwealth Government was economic development. A sound economic system would un¬ doubtedly in sure the political in dependence of the country in substance as well as in form, while it also provided the govern¬ ment with the wherewithal to provide for the well-being and prosperity of its people. It is probably fair to assume that one of Quezon’s nightmares when he assumed the presidency was the problem of economic adjustment of an in dependent Philip¬ pines which has had several decades of economic dependence on the United States. For in deed, what would happen to the Philip¬ pine economy, and to the new Philippine Republic, when pre¬ ferential trade arrangements with the United States would ter- HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 362 minate in 1946? The other aspect of the economic problem was for eign control of vital sectors of Philippine resources. These were not only American and Spanish, but Chinese and Japanese as well, who played significant roles in the economic affairs of the country. So what kind of in dependence would be afford¬ ed the Filipinos if they were a minor factor in the management of their economic resources? The economic trend during the Commonwealth period was slow and uneven development. There were sectors that were strong and well-developed. Agriculture was the most important sector of the Philippine economy, providing employment for 65% of the labor force and contributing about 40% of the na¬ tion al in come and 75% of the value of exports. It was, however, predominantly export agriculture, producing crops geared to the American market — sugar, coconut, to bacco and abaca. Yet while export agriculture flourished, the lives of the great mass of Fili¬ pinos remained dismal. Other sectors of the agricultural economy did not fare so well. The emphasis on production for the export market was so great that the Philippines, potentially one of the great food- surplus-producing areas in Asia, became one of the major food deficit areas. American economic policy obviously ignored the long-range problem of developing Philippine agricutlure and improving the agrarian situation"

The agrarian problem raised the more fundamental questions of political stability and econo¬ mic progress. And finally, in dustrialization was at an extremely low level. Filipino capital was no match to for eign capital. There was, thus, a need to build some sectors of the economy, while the whole economic and social structure needed re¬ structuring to better serve the needs of the people and the country. Trade Relations with the United States The most pressing economic problem in volved trade rela¬ tions with the United States. In the years before the estab¬ lishment of the Commonwealth, Philippine economy had be¬ come tied to the American market. Sales of Philippine products to the United States in creased enormously because of free trade while sales to for eign countries had, in the 1930 s, become less than what they were at the beginning of the decade. Since 1909 TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 363 the principal exports of the Philippines entered the American market practically free and were limited only by congressionally- set quotas and a fairly small processing tax which was returned to the Philippine government. Under the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act of 1934, this arrangement was to continue for five years, then for five years 5% of the appropriate tariffs would be levied each year against Philippine products so that in the last year of the Commonwealth, in 1945-1946, 25% of the American tariff would be in force on each item entering the United States. With com¬ plete in dependence in 1946, “a brutal leap” to full tariff would be applied to Philippine exports to the United States, During the ten-year transition period there would be no reciprocal limits or duties on American products entering the Philippines - “a shocking in equality,” as some would say. “An appalling in dif¬ ference to Philippine welfare,” overshadowed the “nobility” of the political provisions of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act! The strong trend to ward the growth of the export economy during the American occupation had some serious effects on the socio-economic situation of the country. The granting of free trade preferences to Philippine exports after 1909 stimulated the production of cash crops for export to the United States. At the same time, it gave to American manufactured imports a competitive advantage which led to the decline of Philippine handicrafts, an important element in the agricultural economy. This led to the emergence of a “colonial type national economy,” heavily dependent on agricultural raw material exports and on manufactured and processed goods as well as food imports. Ideally, American and Filipino leadership should have worked during the years before 1934 to develop new capital-for ming in dustries in the Philippines that would not compete with busi¬ ness in the United States. Instead, because of the free trade rela¬ tion ship, the economy of the Philippines remained tied to the United States. Once the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act became law, American and Filipino businessmen continuously pointed out that the ten-year transition period was too short to permit the necessary basic restructuring of the Philippine economy — i. e., develop alternative sources of revenue, diversify agricultural production and seek new market outlets for Philippine products. Loss of the American market, or even a serious curtailment once the tariffs went into effect, would mean a paralyzing and deva¬ stating blow to the United States. Businessmen, both Filipinos and Americans, felt that the United States must reverse either 364 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE its political situation to permit a dominion relationship, or its economic position, to permit reciprocal preference in tariff. In April 1937, a Joint Preparatory Committee for Philip¬ pine Affairs proceeded to study the economic question (but left alone the political situation), with the aim of softening and and stretching the period of economic adjustment. The Com¬ mittee recommended that upon in dependence, in stead of the “brutal leap” to complete separation, there would begin a 15-year period in which decreasing duty-free quotas would be substituted for in creasing export taxes on most products. For sugar and abaca, there would be a prdgressive decline in tariff preferences. (Total dissociation would take place in 1960.) American pro¬ ducts entering the Philippines were to be subject to reciprocal tariff, likewise graduating to ward 100%. In August 1940, the Philippine Economic Adjustment Act (also called the Tydings- Kocialkowski Act) was passed, which removed the in crease in export tax which would have been applied from 1949 on Philip¬ pine coconut oil, cigars, embroideries and pearly but tons exported to the United States, substituting in stead a declining duty-free quota for each product. \\... ■' i ■ ■. y-> ’ Philippine Independence Re-Examined Since the United States was not in clined to tinker with the political status of the Philippines, Quezon decided to test the waters. In early 1937, Quezon stated that he wanted the date of Philippine in dependence advanced to late 1938 or early 1939. In declaring this, Quezon was admitting that in dependence was impractical and was looking for dominion status, perhaps think¬ ing that that was the answer to the problems of economic adjust¬ ment.

The economic relations then prevailing were in to lerable since the United States could make changes almost at will to suit American in terests, with the Philippines unable to defend its economic in terests because of its political status. Quezon worried about congressional tinkering with the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act and felt that Philippine' Amcriean relations would be best stabilized by a treaty between two sovereign powers. Quezon’s at tempts to secure beneficial modifications of the Tydings-Mc¬ Duffie Act gave widespread publicity to the economic realities facing the Philippines that it would be better for the United States to retain the Philippines in definitely — if the United States would have them. Quezon in creasingly realized that the end of the TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 365 transition period would not find the Philippines in any better economic situation for in dependence than in 1937, for the process of economic adjustment had been painfully slow. 3 Basically, the record shows that Quezon ciesired prolonged preferential free trade with the United States, and continued naval and military protection, for this seemed the best solution to the seemingly enormous problems of the Commonwealth. The re-examination of Philippine in dependence was not received well by the Filipinos, so Quezon backed off from suggestions for post¬ ponement or abandonment of in dependence in 1946. Instead he advised his people to prepare for it and “move for ward firmly and courageously to achieve our long-cherished ideal — the estab¬ lishment of the Philippine Republic — and to secure for our people prospeiity, happiness and freedom under the shelter of peace and democracy.” It has been said that American policy was in sensitive to the emerging problem of economic development. Be that as it may, some of the blame for the stagnancy during the transition period must rest with Philippine enterprise and with the Com¬ monwealth government. Philippine businessmen tended to seek traae preferences rather than to change methods of production and marketing, or to diversify their endeavors. They preferred to cling to the artificial sustenance of the American market. The Commonwealth period enjoyed one of the earliest, genuine possibilities for economic decolonization, but in those / years, from 1935 to the outbreak of the war in 1941, there was little economic development externally stimulated or domestic¬ ally sought. The failure to meet economic problems was partly a result of military considerations. The military commanded 22% of the Philippine national budget and that and other concerns drained the Philippine economy. Further, Americans underesti¬ mated the economic dependence into which they had led the Filipinos. By 1940, the colonial type export-import economy had developed to such a degree that the proceeds from the agricul¬ tural export crops amounted to approximately 1/3 of the to tal national in come. It was estimated that no less than 6 million out of the to tal population of 16 million were dependent on the cash crop export commodities for their livelihood. Not only was there a large dependency on the production of these export crops, but also there appeared to be little in clination 366 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE to change the existing structure by re-or ienting in ternal pro¬ duction and consumption patterns. Alien Control of the Economy As serious as Philippine dependence on the American market was the fact that the Filipinos did not control their economy. Mining, public utilities and in dustrial sectors of the economy were heavily capitalized by American in vestment companies that exported Philippine products to the American market. Aside from the Americans, the Chinese and Japanese also exercised tre¬ mendous control over certain sectors of the economy. The Chinese controlled 75-82% of retail trade and operated credit facilities, directed and financed the production of rice and other staples, as well as to bacco, hemp and copra. They also in vested in the logging and timber in dustry, manufacturing, banking and real state. Japanese activity in the Philippines in creased with the in auguration of the Commonwealth and the waning of the De¬ pression. In 1934, the Japanese, for the first time, displaced the United States as the chief seller of cotton piece goods in the Philippines. They also desired an expanding role in the in ternal economic development of the Philippines — such as in retail business, fishing, mining, lumbering, some extractive in dustries and manufacturing. In 1939, Japanese immigrants exceeded the Chinese for the first time in Philippine history. They were very evident in Manila, and Davao was practically a Japanese colony. Quezon’s solution to the for eign domination of the Philippine economy was to call for economic nationalism. An Anti-Dummy Law was passed in May 1939 which punished Filipinos who allow¬ ed the mselves to be used as “dummies” or fronts by alien busi¬ ness men and in vestors. In May 1940, an Immigration Law limited to 500 the number of quota immigrants permitted annually to enter the Philippines. Credit facilities through the National Credit Corporation encouraged Filipinos to engage in retail trade. The National Economic Protectionism Association (NEPA) developed Filipino preference for products grown or produced in the Philippines, thus making them less dependent on Amer¬ ican goods. In 1936, the Manila Trading Center distributed products to more than 400 small manufacturers and merchants through the Manila Carnival, provincial and municipal fairs and expositions, and provincial trading centers"

In 1938, the Key to Economic Nationalism, or KENA concept, was launched, aimed at promoting Filipino participation in domestic trade and com- TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 367 merce and Filipinos were urged to patronize home-made products and protect Filipino distributors and retailers. To check further advance of Japanese business in Davao, a broad program for the development of Mindanao was undertaken. Large tracts of land were opened as colonization sites for settlement projects, in Cotabato, Agusan and Davao. Quezon stressed that one of the aims of his administration was to grant Filipinos every facility that they needed to acquire an in creasing share in business and econo¬ mic activities. Aside from the problem areas, the Commonwealth government also turned its at tention to the development of the to tal economy. Quezon promised to promote economic development, in parti¬ cular, the establishment of basic in dustries and other in dustries, not only to provide employment but also to bring the country closer to economic sufficiency. He also pledged to aid agriculture, promote cooperatives, effect a coordination of transportation, suppress “cut-throat” competition, ensure that the rates charged by public utilities were reasonable, reduce the in terest rate and provide tariff protection for local in dustries. Quezon was anxious to restore to the agricultural sector the at tention it deserved. His government was keen to diversify •the agricultural economy so as to rectify dependence on sugar and to bacco, which were subject to the vagaries of the American market and tariff changes. Hence at tention was directed to the cultivation of on ions, cotton and rubber. Small in dustries to supply the domestic market were also encouraged, such as cotton spinning, soap-making and production of foodstuffs. Industrialization, which was at an extremely low level, was at tempted, for it was thought that it would raise the standard of living of the people if prices of several necessities were reduced and it would help secure for Filipinos the wages and profits which were going to American factory-owners and workers. To overcome the problems which hindered extensive in dustrial¬ ization, the government, through the National Power Corporation, exploited the hydro-electric resources of the country (such as the Caliraya River Project), undertook research and development of some in dustries to determine what would be profitable, and extended transportation and communication facilities. One gets the impression that Quezon had a hand in the minutest details of the planning of the economy. Indeed, that was the case for Quezon did not believe in the philosophy of 368 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE laissez-faire in economics but favored government leadership in productive activities to plan the national economy. He believed in a state-directed economic system since government was in the best position to provide the degree of economic stimulation that was needed to meet the problems of an in dependent nation. This was no surprise as Quezon operated pretty much the same way with his political philosophy. In March 1936, the National Eco¬ nomic Council was created to direct the economic activities of the Commonwealth. i “Partyless Democracy” The Philippine Commonwealth was a “Quezon government,” with Quezon clearly dominating political life (sometimes even shrewdly administering by radiophone from halfway around the world!) and the National Assembly almost to tally submissive to his domination. Quezon was clearly the most dynamic personality of the pre-war era and exemplified the “modem lawyer-politician” so characteristic of the political leadership of contemporary Philippines. He was the progenitor of a system of politics and a style of leadership that has left an in delible imprint on the Philippine polity. During the Commonwealth, a system of “clientelist politics” that had been * evolving for almost half a century was in stitutionalized and perfected. As Commonwealth President, Quezon perfected a patronage system he had used as Senate President (from 1916-1935) to establish his dominance over Philippine politics. This was an in ter-related and finely-tuned system that stretched from the barrio to Malacanang, and even to Washington. Quezon devoted considerable energies to the mastery of provincial rivalries through in tervention and manipulation of the disposition of patronage. He controlled the legislature and politicians became subservient to him through “mollification, coalition and fusion.” By 1941, on the eve of the war, he had eliminated all elite opposition within and with out the Nacionalista Party and could announce a the ory of “partyless democracy.” “Opposition parties” and “in dividual liberties” were to demo¬ cratic “fetishes” that must be discarded, he in to ned. In sum, he had shaped the written and unwritten constitution, set the standard of executive leadership, for ged the terms of post-in dependence relations with the United States, fashioned a close link between provincial and national politics, and selected the next generation of political leaders. TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMONWEALTH 369 The American High Commissioner worried that the con¬ stitutional amendment permitting the president two four-year terms, in stead of one six-year term, was an “exceeding danger to democracy,” opening the way to in definite in cumbency and dictatorship.

This “trend to ward to talitarianism” during the Commonwealth alarmed the American High Commissioners and Washington was duly warned. “The Filipinos have to do their own thinking and learn from contemporary lessons or ‘bust’,” Quezon explained, and then proceeded to tell High Commissioner Francis Sayre to mind his own business. Quezon did not see his own primacy and in creasing power as a problem to his people: “the good of the state, not the good of the in dividual, must prevail.” The failure of the country’s leader¬ ship to provide a balanced party system and to correct the un¬ even distribution of power in the government resulted in the continuing dominance of an “irresponsible autocracy” which further aggravated the plight of the “unrepresented minorities.” In a lot of ways, the Commonwealth era had been stagnant; the post-war years of the Republic were the true years of tran¬ sition to in dependence. On the eve of the war, there were serious concerns that the transition period would not be long enough to prepare the country for in dependence. The economy was trou¬ bled; social tensions were in creasing. Overdependence on a few exports, tenantry, in debtedness, low productivity, corruption and in efficiency, undercapitalization, miserable working condi¬ tions all the symptoms of economic backwardness were present as they had been at the turn of the century. Some of them had been mildly alleviated, others were much worse. The country needed land reform, extensive private in vestment in in dustry, and adequate governmental in vestment in agricultural credit and technology. The crushing in equality of wealth and power, which antedated the American period, was neither removed nor reduced. While the American colonial regime might be blamed for its failure to address some of these problems, it is equally significant to point out that legislative power was in Filipino hands as early as 1916 and executive power as early as 1935. Yet no basic pro¬ grams for economic and social development took hold until the post-war period. Quezon seldom tried to come to grips w Hh the economic prob¬ lems until the Commonwealth period, and during that time, he seemed to rest most of his hopes for development upon continued 370 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE preferential trade with the United States. At any rate, six years in the life of a nation was much too short to provide solutions to problems which had been around for much longer. The out¬ break of the war in 1941 derailed Filipino preparations for in¬ dependence. 20 RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION In consonance with President Mc Kinley’s “Benevolent Assi¬ milation” Proclamation, the United States in troduced in the Philippines a regime of democratic partnership under which the Filipinos played the role of junior partner. The policy, while not satisfactory enough from the point of view of the Filipino nationalist, was nevertheless a decided improvement over that of Spain. Universal education was stressed; public health and welfare was carried to the remote barrios; commerce, in dustry, and trade were given impetus; basic in dividual freedoms were respected; means of communication and transportation were greatly improved; and political consciousness was developed through the in troduction of American political in stitutions and practices. Side by side with these positive results of the American occupation were the negative results: the general economic dependence on the United States, the partial loss of the racial heritage, the continuance of the colonial ment ality, and a distorted sense of values. Progress in Education.“ The greatest contribution of the United States to Philippine civilization is the system of public education. Directly opposed to the Spanish system which em¬ phasized, on one hand, the study of the Catholic religion, and on the other, the employment of the Philippine languages rather than Spanish as pedagogical aid* the American educational system emphasized the democratic traditions and the practical application of laws and principles. It is not, however, assumed that the American system was hostile to religion, but that this subject was optional rather than compulsory. The relegation of religion to the optional category was based on the principle of the separation of Church and State, under which the Church had no say in running the public school system.

From 1903 to 1914, Fili¬ pino students who showed aptitudes in some branches of learn¬ ing were sent to the United States as pensionados. Upon their return, they either taught school or worked in government of¬ fices. Thus the American system prepared the Filipino not only for teaching, but also for administrative service, an asset in the Filipinization of the government. Higher education was provided by the establishment of the state-supported University of the Philippines in 1908. Other educational in stitutions, owned and operated by private in divid¬ uals or corporations, were established to slake the Filipinos’ thirst for knowledge. Some of these in stitutions, like the Uni¬ versity of Sto. Thomas, the Escuela de Derecho (School of Law), the Institute Burgos (Burgos Institute) and others, continued to use Spanish as the medium of in struction, but the pressure of competition for ced them to abandon Spanish in favor of Eng¬ lish. Their graduates, who had very little acquaintance, if at all, with the English language were greatly handicapped in govern¬ ment examinations, which were conducted in English. Thus, English came to be the language of in struction in all schools, colleges and universities — a fact which explains why English is understood throughout the Philippines. The net result of such a system was the in crease of Filipino literacy. There are no reliable data to show the percentage of literacy at the close of the Spanish period, but it is probably safe to assume that the figure was somewhere between 5% and 8%. By 1903, when the first census under the Americans was taken, the figure jumped to 44.2%. By 1918, when the second census was taken, literacy in creased to 49.2%, and in 1935, RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 373 when the Commonwealth was in augurated, it soared to 65%. This in crease in Filipino literacy under the Americans was made possible not only by the number of schools, colleges, and uni¬ versities established during the period from 1900 to 1935, but by the adult education program of the American regime. Adult education was experimented by American missionaries in the non-Christian areas from the early years of the American occu¬ pation, but it was not until about 1933 that adult education became a movement. The University of the Philippines pioneered in that vast undertaking when some of its professors and students, aided by adult education experts, launched a campaign of literacy in the rural areas. Public Health and Welfare.—Next in importance to the public educational system as America’s contribution to Philippine civil¬ ization was the in troduction of a scientific program of public health and welfare. Before 1900, ravages of cholera, smallpox, dysentery, malaria, tuberculosis, and other deadly diseases, plagued the people. While it is true that the Spanish colonial government in troduced vaccination and created of fices, such as the Bureau of Health (1806) and the Central Council of Vacci¬ nation (1851), to guard the health of the people, yet because of in efficiency and/or in competence of the colonial of ficials the good in tentions of the government were frustrated. Public and private sanitation and hygiene were far from satisfactory so that mortality was high. When the Americans came, they im¬ mediately set to work to minimize the spread of diseases and to improve, on the other hand, the health of the people. Epi¬ demics that used to migrate to the Philippines were either pre¬ vented or minimized by the establishment of the Quarantine Service supervised by competent American doctors and public health of ficers. Infant mortality and the in cidence of malaria and other dis¬ eases were reduced considerably by the in troduction of new methods of prevention and treatment and by educating the peo¬ ple in the elementary principles of hygiene and sanitation. The task, the American doctors found out, was difficult, for the Fili¬ pinos, superstition-ridden and ignorant of the strange power of the minute germs to cause deadly diseases, were not easily con¬ vinced by the efficacy of medical methods in combating the causes of death from various sicknesses. The early Americans, then, were up against a for midable wall of ignorance and super¬ stition which made the task of public health improvement dif¬ ficult. 374 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The creation in 1901 of the Board of Public Health, which became a bureau at a later date, signaled the in tensified cam¬ paign not only for in proved public health, but also for the era¬ dication of superstition and ignorance. Field men were sent to the provinces to explain the workings of modem sanitation and hygiene. Dispensaries, leprosaria, and hospitals were established to take care of sick and in fected people. The American contri¬ but ion to Filipino health may be gleaned from the fact that in 1898 the death rate per 1,000 persons was 30.5%, while in 1907 it slumped to 21.29%. Except in 1917-1918, when cholera and smallpox epidemics broke out, the mortality per 1,000 persons progressively diminished in succeeding years. At the same time that the Americans were battling diseases, ignorance and superstition they were also providing facilities for the release of human misery and misfortune. Asylums for the or phans, the in sane, and the juvenile of fenders were found¬ ed. A new at titude was thus created for the welfare of these unfortunates who, in the past, might have been allowed to en¬ danger society or might have been imprisoned with out giving them the chance to survive in a brutal society. The vocational training given to the or phans and the juvenile delinquents re¬ sulted in their moral and physical rehabilitation.

Interest in public welfare was awakened among the people and a new pub¬ lic philosophy was bom to replace that of apathy and in difference. The result of the development of health and welfare may be seen not only in decreased mortality, but more so in the im¬ provement of the standard of living. The salt-and-rice nutrition was replaced by a balanced diet which, in turn, resulted in phy¬ sical robustness. At the turn of the century, the average Fili¬ pino height measured somewhere between 5’2” and 5’4”, but with improved diet, exercise, and sports the height in creased to between 5’4” and 5’6”. Trade, Commerce, and Industry.—The economic develop¬ ment of the Philippines under the United States may be at tribut¬ ed to the free trade relations that the Americans imposed upon the country. As early as 1902, a reduction of 25% was allowed on goods coming from the Philippines. Nevertheless, the Amer¬ ican Congress consistently refused to admit Philippine products into the United States free of duty. It was not until 1909, when the American Congress passed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, that partial free trade relations between the Philippines and the RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 375 United States were established. Under this Act, all Philippine exports, except rice, were allowed to enter American markets free of duty within certain quota limits. On the other hand, American exports to the Philippines were unlimited and duty¬ free. To correct the in equality in the law, the American Cong¬ ress passed the Simmons-Underwood Tariff Act in 1913 which abolished the quota limitations on Philippine export products like hemp, sugar, and to bacco. The result of these free trade relations with the United States was that Philippine for eign trade rose to unheard-of proportions. Statistics show that from 1900 to 1909, before the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act was passed, the average annual export of the Philippines amounted to 60.9 million pesos; this figure in creased to 94.7 millions in 1910-1914; to 177.3 millions in 1914-1918,* to 234.7 millions in 1919-1924, to 297.9 millions in 1925-1930; and decreased to 213.2 millions in 1930-1935. The reason for the decrease in 1930-1935 was the world-wide economic depression. Except during the period of the first World War, 1914-1918, the Philippines always had a favorable balance of trade. Domestic trade likewise developed. In 1917, the gross mer¬ chants’ sales was P 400,197,966, but in 1935 it rose to P 631,614,- 000. Comparing the growth of Philippine for eign and domestic trade, the latter was slow, for in ternal trade of the country was mostly in the hands of aliens. At the time of the in auguration of the Commonwealth, the Chinese controlled 50% of the domestic trade, the Filipino 25%, the Japanese 20% and other nationalities 5%. The development of Philippine domestic trade under the Americans was, the refore, not actually a boon to the Filipinos, who had to play second fiddle to the aliens. In in dustry, the Philippines developed in the sense that fac¬ to ries, such as textile and cigar and cigarette factories, mul¬ tiplied. Sawmills, coconut oil mills, cordage factories, fishing and fish-canning, alcohol distilleries, and sugar centrals were established beyond the wildest dreams of the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Mining, one of the most important in dus¬ tries, became the backbone of Philippine economy. In 1929, the gold mining in dustry produced P 6,740,781 worth of gold; this figure soared to P 31,979,030 in 1935. Household in dustries in¬ creased their capital in vestments from P 16,500,000 in 1918 to almost P 50,000,000 in 1935. The economic prosperity that followed Philippine-American 376 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLF free trade relations was deceptive. While it improved the stand¬ ard of living, it was nevertheless artificial, for economic pros¬ perity was dependent on a relation that was basically unsound. Owing to the free trade relations, most of the Philippine ex¬ ports went to American markets. Other for eign markets were neglected so that the closure of American ports to undutiable Philippine exports resulted in economic dislocation. It was for this reason that earlier Speaker Sergio Osmena and Resident Commissioner Manuel L. Quezon opposed free trade relations, for it was their belief that Philippine dependence on the Amer¬ ican markets would, in the long run, endanger the political in¬ dependence of the country. The unwisdom of such an arrange¬ ment, that is, the free trade relations between the Philippines and the United States, was shown up when restrictions on the exportation of Philippine sugar, to bacco, hemp, and coconut were provided in the Tydings-Mc Duffie Independence Act of 1934. These restrictions worked havoc on Philippine economy, for the surplus products that could no longer enter the Amer¬ ican markets free of duty had a difficult time finding other for eign markets. The over-all effect of the Philippine-American free trade relations was, the refore, the placing of Philippine economy at the mercy of the Americans. Transportation and Communication.—Progress in health and welfare and in trade, commerce and in dustry was paralleled by similar progress in transportation and communication. Eco¬ nomic development would be meaningless if the means of trans¬ portation and communication were primitive, for commercial and in dustrial products- need to be transported efficiently to various places for marketing purposes. Thus the development of the country’s economy was accompanied by the development of means of communication and transportation.” This rapid de¬ velopment is shown by a comparative study: at the end of the Spanish period, the Philippines had less than 1,^)0 miles of road.

By 1935, the mileage in creased to 12,912. f 2. Bridges and culverts numbered 2,600 in 1898; this number rose to 8,100 in 1935. The means of transportation vastly improved, for while the ancient bull carts, carretelas, and calesas existed, the cars, trucks, and railway cars speeded up the means of transportation. In 1903, there were 195 kilometers of railway; in 1935, the number in creased to 1,395 kilometers. This development in railroad transportation was preceded by the government’s acquisition of the Manila-Dagupan Railway Company, which became the Manila Railroad Company. The government extended RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 377 the railroad lines to the north and south of Luzon, the reby bring¬ ing the far-flung provinces nearer Manila, the political, cultural, and commercial center. Water transportation, too, was developed to connect the islands of the south with the provinces of Luzon. Very little in terisland shipping existed during the Spanish period, for the Spanish colonial of ficials were more in terested in hanging about Manila than in developing the provinces economically. The in¬ terisland shipping during those days was limited to sailboats, bancas, cascos, and praus — certainly not efficient enough to promote in terisland trade and commerce. With the coming of the Americans, in terisland shipping was encouraged. In 1902, the American colonial government opened more than a hundred ports to domestic shipping. To protect domestic coastwise ship¬ ping the Philippine Legislature passed a law in 1923 providing that only ships owned locally could engage in in terisland shipping. Progress in communication was notable. Telephone lines were in troduced in Manila in 1905 and radio-telephone service in 1933. Towns and provincial capitals were linked to gether by telephones, telegraph lines, and radio. Mail of fices throughout the country, numbering more than a thousand in 1935, handled or dinary mail, telegrams, money or ders, and air mail letters and packages. The American role in the economic development of the Philippines, particularly in the field of transportation and com¬ munication, is not exactly altruistic. Doubtless, self-in terest played a role that, though not obvious, was nevertheless per¬ vading. The improvement and building of roads, railways, and bridges meant importation of American to ols, equipment, and materials. Good roads and bridges meant, too, importation of American trucks and cars. To make these vehicles run, im¬ portation of American oil and gasoline was imperative. Truck and automobile spare parts and tires were imported from the United States. Considering that American goods entered Philip¬ pine ports duty-free, in accordance with the Payne-Aldrich Ta¬ riff Act of 1909, it is easy to conclude that the Philippines was one of America’s greatest markets in the Orient. The American imperialists of 1898 were, the refore, justified in their clamor to take the Philippines under the wing of the American Eagle. As the history of the Philippines under the United States eloquently testifies, American altruism was engrafted with profit motive. I 378 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Individual Freedoms-Mc Kinley’s “Benevolent Assimilation” Proclamation and his “Instructions” to the second or Taft Com¬ mission laid the bases of American policy in the Philippines. This policy was rooted in the recognition of the in dividual free¬ doms, the foundation of any democratic system. Much of the ugly connotations of the American in trusion in the Philippines was whitewashed by extending to the Filipinos the democratic principle of equality — in rights and obligations as well as in opportunities. In view of what the Americans believed then as dangerous thoughts, the Filipinos in the early years of American tutelage were not allowed to enjoy the full measure of freedom. The Sedition Law of 1901, passed by the Philippine Commission, considered it seditious of any Filipino to advocate in dependence. The “Flag Law” of 1907 prohibited the display of the Filipino flag. Only when the American authorities became sure of the peace and or der conditions did they scrap the two laws. Except for these two laws which were operative during the early years of the American regime, the Filipinos enjoyed the era of freedom — freedom of religious worship, freedom of the press, freedom to assemble peaceably for the redress of grievances, freedom to change domicile, and freedom of speech. It is, how¬ ever, a mistake to suppose that the Americans taught the Filipinos the meaning of freedom, that they brought from across the Pacific tne heritage of democracy. The Filipinos knew the mean¬ ing of freedom before the Americans came, for they enjoyed its blessings under the Revolutionary Government and the Re¬ public. They had democracy, and practised it, when the Amer¬ icans arrived. They practised it in the Tejeros Convention, in the election of delegates to the Malolos Congress, and in the framing of the Malolos Constitution. What the Americans did was to broaden the democratic base, that is to say, they made the principles of democracy apply to all — even to the poorest and illiterate common tao. Such was the freedom enjoyed by the Filipinos that politi¬ cians and writers, even at the beginning of the American occu¬ pation and despite the Sedition Law, at tacked not only the American administration, but also in dividual Americans who committed a misdemeanor. The pages of the nationalistic pe¬ riodical El Renacimiento and its Tagalog section, the Muling Pagsilang, were fu U of vitriolic at tacks on the Americans, cul¬ minating in the now famous “Aves de Rapiha” (Birds of Prey) Libel Case"

In 1908, El Renacimiento vigorously at tacked the RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 379 then Secretary of the Interior, Dean Worcester, who immediately sued the owner and editors of the paper for libel. The accused were defeated in court and the newspaper, to gether with its machinery, was sold at auction. Teodoro M. Kalaw, the editor of the paper, was sentenced to jail, but was pardoned by Governor-General Harrison. The freedom enjoyed by the writers found expression in the drama. Nationalistic plays were staged to remind the peo¬ ple of their freedom and in dependence. Aurelio Tolentino’s Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas (Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow), Juan Matapang Cruz’s Hindi Ak 6 Patay (I Am Not Dead), Juan Abad’s Tanikal&ng Ginto (Gold Chains), and Severino Reyes’s Walang Sugat (Not Wounded), were proscribed by the authorities. Tolentino, in particular, was arrested and jailed for advocating in dependence in his play. As the condition of peace and or der improved, the repres¬ sion of civil liberties was removed. Individuals, as well as po¬ litical parties, were free to talk their heads off. For the first time in their history, the Filipinos enjoyed all the basic free¬ doms in their relations with one another and with the American colonial government. Political Consciousness.—Colonization implies the bringing over of American practices and in stitutions. Partisan politics was one of those in stitutions which the Americans brought to the Philippines. The municipal elections tha: followed the im¬ plantation of American sovereignty gave the Filipinos the first taste of politics, American-brand. To be sure, there was at the begin¬ ning no furor, no color to campaigns, for the Filipinos were as yet too politically naive to understand the in tricacies of modem politics. With the founding of political parties, however, they began u discern the American political pattern: issues were outlined, platforms were laboriously prepared, speeches were delivered, and political chest funds accumulated. Up to approxi¬ mately 1916, however, Philippine national elections were honest and based on the merits of the issues in volved. After the creation of a bicameral legislature in 1916, Philippine politics followed the American groove. The electors, hitherto in nocent, began to be corrupted by politicians. Expenses of candidates soared; the electors, tasting for the first time the power of the ballot, began to think in terms of personality and personal welfare. Thus many American political practices finally found a rich soil in the Philippines. 380 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE But over and above the negative effects of the imported brand of politics, the Filipinos learned the in tricate machinery of government. The control of the law-making body and the Filipinization policy of Harrison led to a deep political con¬ sciousness. The suppressed nationalism of the first decade of American rule was released and ultimately found expression in the agitation for political in dependence. Language and Literature - Probably one of the most lasting American in fluences in the Philippines is the development of a Filipino literature in English and the adoption of American words and phrases in the Philippine languages, particularly in Tagalog. With English as the medium of in struction in all schools, many talented Filipinos turned from their native languages to English as the medium of creative expression. The pioneers during the first two decades of American rule were Juan F. Salazar, Justo Juliano, Bernardo P. Garcia, Maximo M. Kalaw, Tarcila Malabanan, Francisco M. Africa, and a few others, who wrote poems and essays that were a pale reflection of the national life. Their command of English was, as was to be expected, rather loose. The second generation of writers had better command of the for eign language. Fernando M. Maramag, Carlos P. Romulo, Mauro Mendez, Cristino Jamias, Vicente M. Hilario, Eliseo Quirino, and others were, with the exception of Maramag and Mendez, essayists. Beginning with the 1930’s, the Filipino writers in English began to ramify: they wrote not only poems and essays, but also short stories and a few novels and dramas. The period from 1930 to the outbreak of the second World War was dominated by the writers of the University of the Philip¬ pines: Federico Mangahas, Salvador P. Lopez, Francisco B. Ica- siano, Amando G. Dayrit, Maria Luna Lopez, Manuel Arguilla, Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido, Arturo B. Rotor, Francisco Arcellana, Bienvenido N. Santos, Maria'Kalaw, and others. Among the “outsiders”, the most prominent were N. V. M. Gonzalez, A. E. Litiaco, Aurelio Alvero and Delfin Fresnosa. The drama and the novel were the most neglected branches of literature, al¬ though a few novels and plays were written. More important as America’s lasting in fluence on Filipino cultural life was the adoption of American words and phrases in the national language. This linguistic process has been going on for a long time now and there is no sign that it will stop. Tagalog, as the language of the capital, was naturally vulnerable RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 381 to American in fluence. A few English words, during the first decade of the century, were adopted into Tagalog: bulakbol (blackball), “slacker”; basket; klase (through Spanish clase), class. By the second and third decades, when American cultural in fluence had deeply penetrated the consciousness of the people, such words as paul (foul), parbol (foul ball), in ing (in ning), mindaun (men down in baseball), bistik (beefsteak), kendi (candy), ispiker (Speaker of the House), plorlider (Floor Lead¬ er), and scores of others, had become part of the Filipino vo¬ cabulary"

Tagalog, as the language of the capital, was naturally vulnerable RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 381 to American in fluence. A few English words, during the first decade of the century, were adopted into Tagalog: bulakbol (blackball), “slacker”; basket; klase (through Spanish clase), class. By the second and third decades, when American cultural in fluence had deeply penetrated the consciousness of the people, such words as paul (foul), parbol (foul ball), in ing (in ning), mindaun (men down in baseball), bistik (beefsteak), kendi (candy), ispiker (Speaker of the House), plorlider (Floor Lead¬ er), and scores of others, had become part of the Filipino vo¬ cabulary. Up to the present, there are about 600 or so English words adopted in the national language. By the third decade, the young Tagalog writers, deeply in¬ fluenced by English literature, began translating English phrases into the national language. While some of the translations were fairly accurate and easily adaptable, yet many were simply awk¬ ward or silly. Most of the English idioms, when translated into Tagalog, became funny. These phrases, translated from English, are more or less adaptable: buhat sa sulok ng mga mata (out of the corner of one’s eyes), sa pagitan ng mga talath (between the lines), sa lik Sd ng pangyayari (in spite of the fact), sa ibabaw ng lahdt (above all), kalangit Sng ipinagbawal (for bidden glory), and others. Overenthusiasm and ignorance of Tagalog idioms compelled some writers to translate English phrases in discrimi¬ nately. The result was unconscious humor. Samples: ihagis ang karitbn sa tata (hitch the wagon to the stars), kumuha ng panukat- hukbd (to take military measures), mapanganib na lumilipad (dangerous fly), sumandal laban sa pader (to lean against the wall), magbukas ng ap Sy (to open fire), etc. The continued use of English as the medium of in struction makes it a potent force in the cultural life of the people. It may in time be replaced by the national language, but its in fluence on the latter has the character of permanence. Negative Results.—The American occupation has its seamy side. In the in timate contact of two peoples the good and the bad sides of the occupying power are in evitably adopted and adapted by the colony. As a people the Filipinos are apt pupils and need not be whipped into line to perform for eign “tricks.” They are naturally imitative and can out-Spanish or out-Amer- ican a Spaniards or an American. Thus many Filipinos take pride in describing the Philippines not only as the only Chris¬ tian country in the Orient, — which means nothing — but also as the most Westernized country in the Orient. 382 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The economic in vasion of the Philippines brought the Amer¬ ican mode of living close to the Filipinos. American goods and services were at first considered luxuries. After forty-five years of occupation, they became necessities. This conditioning of the Filipino mind to the American standard of living has made them economically dependent on the United States. The result is the neglect and consequent death of Filipino in dustries. No one now hears of the Baliwag hats, or of the Malabon textile, or of many Filipino delicacies. They have been replaced by American goods, which the Filipinos, in their sense of false pride, call Stateside. Is your pair x>f shoes Stateside? Is your car im¬ ported from the States or assembled here in the Philippines? Such questions, though silly and pretentious, are common. If it is Stateside it is the best. If it is made in the Philippines it is in ferior. The ment al at titude that despises one’s own and loves any¬ thing for eign is the natural result of American “altruism” bolstered by propaganda. While the Spaniards almost killed the Filipinos by maltreatment, the Americans, on the other hand, almost smothered the Filipinos with “kindness.” The Spaniards softened the Filipinos by in flicting physical and spiritual in juries on them; the Americans softened the Filipinos by pampering their stomach. The first became a negative factor in the development of Filipino nationalism; the second became a positive factor in the de-Fili- pinization of the Filipinos. Thus, while enjoying the “blessings” of America, the Filipino suffered a partial loss of th$ir racial heritage: the ties that bind the family have been loosened; the love of their language and culture has been replaced by the adoration of the American language and culture; and the tradi¬ tion al communal unity has to a certain extent been superimposed upon by the “let-well-enough-aione” philosophy. The softening of the Filipino spine, which resulted from too much American canned goods, in turn resulted in the persistence of the colonial ment ality. Having developed an extreme liking for things American with out critical evaluation of their in trin¬ sic worth, the average Filipino considers it blasphemous to cri¬ ticize the United States or any American. A Filipino who places his country’s in terest first and for emost is branded an anti- American, for he does not consider the American in capable of erring. Naturally, the Americans encourage this menial at titude, for it is to their self-in terest that the Filipinos continue thinking of America and the Americans with something akin to awe. “Nothing RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION 383 like America” in a phrase that has sunk into the subconscious of the average Filipino, even if, in trying to be charming and kittenish to humor his for mer master, he is, in turn, despised and looked down upon as a prehensile moron. The average American materialism which finds expression in an in or dinate love of material possessions found a virgin soil in the or dinary Filipino mind. The “movies” have been the purveyor of American materialism, for they show the advan¬ tages of having flashy cars, mink coats, large and well-appointed houses, refrigerators, television and radio sets, and such other appurtenances as would make for “success.” Success is meas¬ ured in terms of material possessions. He is successful who earns a “fast buck”; he is successful who has made millions out of nothing; he is successful if, in spite of his illiteracy, he wins a congressional or municipal seat. The people as a rule have lost their sense of values"

The people as a rule have lost their sense of values. Values to them are those that can be turned into hard cash; if they are not or can’t, they are valueless. There was a time when Filipinos looked up to the poets and thinkers. Women, too, adored them and swooned over them in the privacy of their chamber. With the in trusion of mate¬ rialism, they for got their poets and thinkers — in fact, they ridiculed them as “fildsofos” in the sense Padre Damaso used the term. Poets are now described as “patay-gutom” — dead hungry, worthless creatures who live in dreams of what is not. Today, since American in fluence is a continuing process, the Filipino is as confused as ever. The tragedy is that this con¬ fusion is mistaken for genius to acquire material possessions. Filipinos excel as imitators. But their imitation is usually limited to the seamy aspect of American life. The good Amer¬ ican traits are seldom, if ever, acquired. Here again, the “mo¬ vies” have played an important role. Gangsterism, juvenile de¬ linquency, promiscuous love affairs, betrayal, racketeering, graft and corruption — all these have been brought to the Philippines through Hollywood. Not that there was no gangsterism or graft and corruption before, but the American films have made them popular. Bandolerismo or brigandage there was during the Spanish regime, but American gangsterism, with its display of machine guns and even brilliant strategy, is something new to the Filipino experience. Many of the social problems that plague Filipino society to day are as much the result of the growth of urban centers as of the American “movies”. ^ ^ ^ ^ PART V THE WAR YEARS 21 THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION V The ten-year preparatory period, known as the Common¬ wealth regime, was rudely in terrupted when the Japanese, look¬ ing for territories to accommodate not only their excess popula¬ tion but also their manufactured goods, started the war in the Pacific. Japanese naval bombers at tacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December 1941. The United States declared war against Japan and the war in the Pacific was for mally on. As a conse¬ quence of this war, the Philippines was occupied by the Japanese. For three years the Filipinos suffered the rigors of war. Civil liberties were suppressed by the enemy, the economy was geared to the demands of the Japanese war efforts, education was re¬ vamped to re-or ient Filipino thinking along Japanese lines, and political life was limited to the Japanese-sponsored Republic. Meanwhile, thousands upon thousands were executed and im¬ prisoned, but the spirit of revolt continued to plague Japanese authorities to the end of the occupation. Background of Pearl Harbor.--One of the factors that led the Americans to acquire the Philippines was the belief that the colony would be of strategic importance to the United States. It was then thought that with the Philippines under the United States, no for eign Power would dare antagonize her. President Theodore Roosevelt expressed this view in January 1906 when, in a letter to Major-General Leonard Wood, he declared that “Japan had no immediate in tention of moving against the United States.” Yet, because of the rising power of Japan, he expressed his apprehension, a year later, to Elihu Root. “I am more con¬ cerned,” he said, “over the Japanese situation than almost any other.” On July 6 of the same year, he again wrote General Wood, then in command in the Philippines, directing him how to hold the Philippines in case of a Japanese at tack. In view of what Roosevelt considered a Japanese menace, he wrote William H. Taft, Secretary of War, that he considered giving the Philip¬ pines immediate in dependence to avoid a Japanese at tack. This idea was based on the supposition that the Philippines was, from 387 388 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the military point of view, a liability rather than an asset to the United States. Roosevelt’s fear was not with out justification. Japan was a fast rising power in the Pacific and the Philippine defenses were rather in adequate to thwart any hostile at tempt to in vade the country. The American military’s apprehensions were quiet¬ ed when President Manuel L. Quezon, soon after the in augura¬ tion of the Commonwealth, prevailed upon General Douglas Mac Arthur to become Field Marshal of the Philippine Army. Mac Arthur’s concept of defense was to build up a Filipino army sufficiently strong to repel a for eign in vasion. Consequently, the commonwealth Assembly’s first move was to pass Common¬ wealth Act No. 1, the National Defense Act, which provided for a citizens’ army. With this army bolstered by bomber squad¬ rons based in the Philippines, it was thought that it would be foolhardy for any for eign Power to in vade the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japan was expanding in surrounding areas. Manchuria was occupied in 1932. Five years later, China pro¬ per was in vaded. In 1940, Japan occupied the northern part of French Indo-China and the following year the whole French colony was occupied. The Japanese menace was now too obvious to be ignored. With Japanese troops concentrating in South¬ east Asia, Filipino and American leaders feared that the Philip¬ pines might become the next target of the Japanese expansion program. On July 26, 1941, the Philippine reserve and reg¬ ular for ces were in corporated into the United States Army under the command of General Mac Arthur. The combined for ces were called the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). At the same time, the United States, Great Britain, and Holland imposed economic sanctions on Japan"

The United States, in particular, froze Japanese assets in the United States the reby preventing Japan from using these assets to her advantage. Nevertheless, the United States exerted all efforts to come to a peaceful understanding with Japan. In September 1941, Japan, apparently to discuss American-Japanese problems in a peaceful manner, sent Admiral K. Nomura to Washington. It was believed that Nomura would propose peace to the American of ficials in or der to avert war. It was while Nomura was presenting his government’s peace proposals to Secretary of State Cordell Hull that the Japanese bombers surprised Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and sank the cream of the American Navy. The bombing occurred in the early morning of December 7,1941, Hawaiian time. Tilt: JAPANESE OCCUPATION 389 Roosevelt and the War.—The treacherous bombing of Pearl Harbor drove the American people to frenzied anger. Secre¬ tary Hull gave vent to his ire when he said: “In all my fifty years in public life I have never seen a document [the Japanese peace proposals] more crowded with in famous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge.” The American naval and mili¬ tary losses at Pearl Harbor amounted to 2,897 men. The trag¬ edy struck deep into the hearts of the Americans. People gathered at the White House in Washington waiting for Pres¬ ident Roosevelt’s message to Congress. It was Monday, De¬ cember 8, 1941, Washington time. At 12:25 P. M., both houses of Congress met in joint session. Five minutes later, President Roosevelt, his face grim and deeply lined with worries, deli¬ vered his message. “Yesterday,” he said solemnly, “Decem¬ ber 7, 1941, — a date which will live in in famy — the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately at tacked by naval and air for ces of the empire of Japan.” Toward the end of the message, he asked Congress to declare war. At one o’clock, the United States Senate declared war with out a dissenting vote. Ten minutes later, the House of Representatives declared war with only one dissenting vote. The following night, Roosevelt spoke to the Americans and to the free world, saying: The sudden criminal at tacks perpetrated by the Japanese in the Pacific provide the climax of a decade of in ternational im¬ morality. Powerful and resourceful gangsters have banded to gether to make war on the whole human race...*** * * * We are now in the midst of war, not for conquest, not for vengeance, but for a world in which this nation, and all that this nation represents, will be safe for our children. Across the Atlantic, on December 8, Prime Minister Win¬ ston S. Churchill of England faced the House of Commons and announced to the world that Great Britain would declare war on Japan. “With the full approval of the nation and of the Empire,” he said, “I pledged the word of Great Britain about a month ago that should the United States be in volved in a war with Japan a British declaration of war would follow within the hour... The Cabinet, which met at 12:30 to day, the refore authorized an immediate declaration of war against Japan.” The European war, which commenced in 1939, now expanded to become the second World War. 390 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The Japanese Offensive.—The general of fensive plan of the Japanese was to strike immediately at the rich Dutch and British possessions in Southeast Asia, specially Malaya and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). To do this, the Japanese naval and air for ces Jiad to destroy the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor in or der to neutralize it, and then to at tack the Philip¬ pines in or der to cut America’s lines of communication in the Pacific. The subjugation of the Philippines was a part of the general plan of conquering the rich countries of Southeast Asia so that their natural resources could be used to bolster up Japan’s war machine. While Pearl Harbor was being at tacked, Japanese bombers and naval guns were shelling Wake Island. The less then 400 American marines fought back heroically but were smothered t>y the numerical superiority of the at tacking enemy. Simul¬ taneously, the enemy struck at Guam and Midway Island, which fell on the same day. In Southeast Asia, the Japanese advanced against Malaya on their way to capture Singapore. In the Phil¬ ippines, four hours after the sneak at tack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese bombed several places in the Philippines simultaneously. Clark Field was bombed in the morning of December 8, 1941 and American planes on the ground were destroyed. Air at tacks were conducted against Davao, Baguio and Aparri on the same day. Nichols Field and Sangley Point suffered the same fate as Clark Field. Manila proper was not at tacked in the first days of the war, but during the last days of December Japanese planes, gleaming in the sunlight, at tacked Port Area and the ships at the piers. To spare the city, General Mac Arthur, on December 26, 1941, declared Manila an open city. Guns were with drawn from the city in or der to comply with the requirements of in ter¬ national law regarding an open city. Mac Arthur’s headquarters at No. 1 Victoria Street, in Intramuros, was evacuated. But the Japanese did not respect Manila as an open city. Sending bombers in broad daylight over the city, the Japanese bombed Manila: Sto. Domingo Church was destroyed; so were the old Intendencia Building, now the Central Bank, San Juan de Letran, Sta. Catalina College, and the of fices of the Philippines Herald, Mabuhay, Debate, and Monday Mail.

The entire resources, in men and material, of the United States stand behind that pledge.” The Occupation of Manila.—The Japanese preparation for the war, particularly the at tack on the Philippines, was planned carefully. Even before their planes could take off to at tack tar¬ gets in the Philippines, three task for ces were already on their way to the Philippines: two were to land in northern Luzon and one in Batan Island. At dawn of December 8, the Japanese landed at Batan with out any opposition. Two days later, enemy landings were made at Aparri and Pandan, near Vigan. In the south, the Japanese, coming from Palau Island, landed at Legazpi on the same day. Similar landings were made in Davao and Jolo on December 20. There was little opposition to these land¬ ings, for there were not sufficient men to meet the enemy. More¬ over the Philippine defenses were poor and only a few planes were on hand to battle the enemy. Rumors which circulated in Manila immediately before the war were to the effect that powerful American bombers, particularly the B-24’s, had arrived and that the Japanese bombers and fighter planes would be blasted out of the blue skies if ever they at tempted to fly over Manila. All these rumors of American strength in the Philippines, it turned out, were really rumors calculated to bolster the morale of the Filipinos. The few American planes in Clark Field and Nichols Field were destroyed in the first days of the Japanese air raids. Consequently, when the enemy for ces landed north and south of Luzon no effective defense could prevent the Japanese from knifing their way through USAFFE territory. Meanwhile, Japanese major landings were made on December 22. The enemy stormed ashore at Lingayen and the Americans, though previously warned of the in vasion, failed to prevent the landing. From Lingayen, the Japanese moved swiftly to Damortis and Rosario and on to Central Luzon. At almost the same time landings were effected at three points along Lamon Bay: at Mauban, Atimonan, and Siain. Two separate for ces were then converging on Manila: the northern force, coming from Lingayen, and the southern force, coming from Lamon Bay. Despite heroic defense whose purpose was to give the USAFFE enough time to retreat to Bataan, the Japanese armies marched 392 HISTORY OF TIIF FILIPINO PEOPLF to ward Manila with but slight opposition, On January 2, 1942; the advance elements of the Japanese in vasion for ces entered Manila from the north and the south. Manila became an occupied city. Quezon in Corregidor.-—Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth, was a very sick man when the war broke out. The sufferings of the people in creased his worries which, to a large extent, contributed to his physical breakdown. Thousands were killed as a result of in discriminate bombings of the enemy and thousands more were hospitalized for wounds received from enemy bombs and bullets. It was obvious to General Mac Arthur that the only way to save his army was to retreat to the Bataan Peninsula where he planned to hold back the Japanese. He issued or ders to the field commanders to save the bulk of the army by taking their military units to Bataan. The retreat was carried out masterfully with out any sign of demoralization in the ranks. On December 24, 1941, Mac Arthur in for med Quezon that he and some of his of ficials, as well as the members of his family, were to leave for Corregidor at two o’clock that afternoon. Quezon immediately called the last meeting of his Cabinet and in for med them of the decision to hole up in Corregidor. Those chosen to accompany him to the island for tress were Secretary of Justice Jose Abad Santos, Vice President Sergio Osmena, General Basilio Valdes and Colonel Manuel Nieto. Jose P. Laurel, then acting Chief Justice, wanted to go with Quezon, but the latter restrained him. “No, Laurel,” the President said, “some¬ one will have to meet the Japanese. The people must be given the necessary protection. Times will be hard. A big man is needed for the job. You must stay.” Laurel, however, pointed out that the Japanese would make demands, some of them im¬ possible. “How far,” he asked, “can I go in cooperating with them?” The question was legitimate, and Quezon had General Mac Arthur called to answer the question. “You can do anything,” said Mac Arthur, “but take the oath of allegiance to the Japanese. If any one does that, I will shoot him when I return.” Then and there Laurel was sworn in as Secretary of Justice to take the place of Abad Santos. Quezon turned to the high of ficials of the Com¬ monwealth and gave them his last in structions: “Do the best you can. Make what bargains you have to with those people [the Japanese]. Try to keep the Philippines to gether in one piece. Try to protect the people from Japan's brutality and avarice. THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 393 You have some to ugh decisions to make. But the job must be done. Do it for the future of the Philippines. ” The Japanese bombers were still hitting the Port Area in Manila at the time Quezon and his party were scheduled to leave.

The Fall of Bataan and Corregidor.-Mac Arthur’s retreat to Bataan was a brilliant maneuver, for in the process he out¬ witted General Masaharu Homma, the Japanese commander-in¬ chief, who failed in his at tempt to encircle the USAFFE as he had contemplated. Maneuvering in a limited territory, Mac- Arthur succeeded in keeping his army in tact and well coordin¬ ated. Several times, the Japanese launched their of fensives against Bataan only to be repulsed with heavy losses. It was the strategy of the Japanese Imperial Command to. subjugate the Philippines within a short period of time in or der to pro¬ ceed immediately to the conquest of other parts of Asia. The heroic defense of the Filipino-American troops on Bataan irri¬ tated the Japanese. Again and again, Japanese land and sea for ces, aided by bombers, returned to the at tack, but the Ba¬ taan lines held out heroically. Japanese leaflets asking the Fili¬ pino soldiers to surrender and to desert their American com- rades-in-arms were dropped on Bataan to demoralize the USAFFE, but the courageous Filipino soldiers ignored the Japanese propaganda. As months dragged on, aid from the United States seemed impossible. The Japanese navy commanded the sea lanes of the Pacific. Moreover, the United States and Great Britain had already agreed on the “Europe-First Policy.” The effect on the Bataan defenders was partial demoralization, for with out arms, ammunition, and food the USAFFE was bound to disintegrate under the pressure of continued enemy at tacks. By mid-March 1942, rations became scarce. Lack of food led to malnutrition. Diarrhea, malaria, and avitaminosis or lack of Vitamins in the body led to a casualty bigger than that in flicted by enemy bullets. Medicine was scarce, too, and the men, suffering from the rigors of war, began to lose hope. General Mac Arthur, on or ders of President Roosevelt, left Corregidor for Australia on March 11, 1942. He was succeeded as commander of the USAFFE by 394 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE General Jonathan Wainwright. President Quezon had earlier left for Australia. They were picked up on the night of February 18 by the submarine Swordfish. Under the circumstances, the Bataan defenders had no other alternative than to surrender. On April 9, General Edward P. King, commander of the for ces on Bataan, surrendered. Some 78,000 of General King’s for ces were in cluded in the surrender negotiations. Around 2,000 escaped to Corregidor and to the surrounding provinces. Wainwright, as USAFFE commander- in-chief, was in Corregidor.' King’s surrender on Bataan, there¬ fore, was an in dividual surrender, and not the surrender of the entire USAFFE force. Thus ended the Battle of Bataan which resounded throughout the world. The surrendered Filipino-American troops were for ced at gunpoint to march from Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga, under the hot tropical sun. Those who could not march because of physical weakness were shot down or bayoneted. So in human was the for ced march that the event has been called the “Death March”. In Capas, the prisoners were huddled to gether like animals, hungry and sick. Meanwhile, the Japanese stepped up their of fensive against Corregidor. From Bataan, now under the Japanese, from the sea, and from Cavite, the island for tress was subjected to in¬ tense fire. There was no rest for the defenders; the enemy bomb¬ ings were continuous, day and night. In Manila, in the stillness of the night, the people could hear the successive bombings and artillery fire directed against Corregidor. Against the clear sky the people of the city could see or ange flashes that heralded the booms of the enemy artillery pounding relentlessly at the historic island. In the morning of May 6, General Wainwright addressed a message to General Homma, through the 4 t Voice of Freedom”, of fering to surrender. In the afternoon, he met General Homma at the conference table. The barrel-chested Homma demanded the surrender of the entire USAFFE for ces in the Philippines. Wainwright hedged, his in tention being to surrender only the men directly under him. But Homma in sisted on the surrender of all, and stood up to leave. Wainwright had no other alternative than to give in to the enemy’s demand. The fall of the Philippines, at least of ficially, was now complete. THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 395 Reorganization of the Government.—On January 3, 1942, a day after Manila became an occupied city, the Commander- in-Chief of the Japanese Imperial Forces, General Masaharu Homma, issued a proclamation announcing the end of the Amer¬ ican occupation and the purpose of the Japanese expedition. The avowed purpose was to “emancipate you [the Filipinos] from the oppressive domination of the U. S. A., letting you estab¬ lish ‘the Philippines for the Filipinos’ as a member of the Co¬ prosperity Sphere in the Greater East Asia and making you enjoy your own prosperity and culture.” During the first month of the occupation, the status of the provinces and chartered cities remained practically the same as during the Commonwealth years. By February, the Japanese were ready to in stitute sweeping reforms in the administration of the government. On January 23, Homma issued an or der to Jorge B. Vargas making him the Chairman of the Executive Commission.

Vargas making him the Chairman of the Executive Commission. The national government was re-named the Cen¬ tral Administrative Organization, composed of six executive departments: Interior; Finance; Justice; Agriculture and Com¬ merce; Education, Health and Public Welfare; and Public Works and Communications. Each of the departments was headed by a Commissioner, whose duty was to “execute an administration within his jurisdiction under the control of the ‘Chairman of the Executive Commission’.” The limitations upon the powers and prerogatives of the Commissioners were assured for the Japan¬ ese when the same or der provided that “Each department shall have a Japanese adviser and Japanese assistant advisers.” It is pretty clear that the Japanese “advisers” were nothing more than spies of the Japanese military authorities. To make sure that apparently harmless persons were to take the reins of gov¬ ernment, the or der further provided that Vargas’ r(‘commendation for the Commissionership of any department or for any subor¬ dinate position was to be approved by the Japanese Commander- in-Chief. The or ganization of each department and the courts of justice was to remain substantially the same as during the Commonwealth, “provided that their outlines be approved by the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Forces.” On the provincial and municipal level, the or der provided for the status quo. To aid the Central Administrative Organization in administering the occupied territory, the Council of State was created on January 29 as an advisory body. The structure of the central government, then, may be represented as follows: ( 396 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Educational Re-O dentation.—The Japanese educational policy was embodied in Military Order No. 2, dated February 17,1942. Its basic points were the propagation of Filipino culture; the dissemination of the principle of the Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere; the spiritual rejuvenation of the Filipinos; the teaching and propagation of Nippongo; the diffusion of vocational and elementary education; and the promotion of love of labor. The motive behind this educational policy was not only to create an at mosphere friendly to Japanese in tentions and war aims, but also to erase the Western cultural in fluences, particularly British and American, on Filipino life and culture. To carry out this policy, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief in structed the Commissioner of Education, Health and Public Welfare to reopen the schools, requiring, at the same time, that teachers and students be made to pledge the mselves to the sup¬ port of the new educational policy. Priority was given to the reopening of elementary schools obviously because the Japanese believed that the mind of the young could be easily moulded into the patterns of the Japanese concept. Next to the elementary schools priority was given to the re-opening of vocational and normal schools, and those in stitutions of higher learning giving courses in agriculture, medicine, fisheries, and engineering. The courses leading to the law degree were not re-opened because THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 397 the Japanese military authorities thought that under the circum¬ stances lawyers were useless. The only worthy courses were those they believed could help in the prosecution of Japan’s concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In accordance with Japanese mandates, the Department of Education, Health and Public Welfare authorized, on March 31, 1942, the re-opening of public elementary schools beginning in June 1942. There was not much enthusiasm in returning to schools, first, because the Filipinos as a whole were suspicious of Japanese in tention, and second, because the children found more enjoyment and money in selling anything or in helping their parents tide over the difficult times. This lack of enthu¬ siasm to receive in struction under the Japanese regime was reflect¬ ed in the comparative smallness of the enrollment: the to tal enrolled in elementary grades as of March 1943 was 267,977. When the Japanese-sponsored Republic was proclaimed on October 14, 1943, the educational set-up did not change much. However, President Jose P. Laurel added the fundamental prin¬ ciple of militant nationalism. It was Laurel’s belief that the Filipinos could stave off spiritual debacle only by resorting to nationalism as a way of life. Consequently, he encouraged the propagation of Tagalog as the national language by using it as the of ficial language. Educational reforms were in stituted by requiring teachers to obtain licenses after undergoing a rigid examination. The teaching of Tagalog, Philippine History, and character education was reserved for Filipinos. Teachers’ li¬ censes were also required of all heads of schools, colleges, and universities. Laurel also required that majority of the govern¬ ing board of any school, college or university be Filipino citi¬ zens. All these were directed at the implementation of the na¬ tion alist credo. For the first time in Philippine history, the aliens were barred from teaching the Filipinos their own his¬ tory, a history that had been hitherto in terpreted according to alien points-of-view. The Republic.—The Japanese authorities realized that it was difficult, if not impossible, to channel Filipino sympathy to ward them and consequently did everything in their power, from threats to caress, to dissipate the Filipinos’ hostility. It was important to them, for propaganda purposes, that the Fili¬ pinos were made to believe that Japan’s in tention was to see the Philippines become a Republic"

It was important to them, for propaganda purposes, that the Fili¬ pinos were made to believe that Japan’s in tention was to see the Philippines become a Republic. Consequently, as early as 398 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE January 21, 1942, Premier Hideki Tozyo, in an address before the Japanese Imperial Diet, said: “Japan will gladly grant the Philippines its in dependence so long as it cooperates and re¬ cognizes Japan’s program of establishing a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” This promise was reiterated on Jan¬ uary 28 when he addressed the House of Peers. He said: “Substantial progress is being made in the degree of coopera¬ tion rendered to the Japanese Empire by the people of the Phil¬ ippines as well as in the restoration of peace and security. Under these circumstances and on condition that further tangible evidence of cooperation is actively demonstrated, it is contem¬ plated to put into effect the statement made previously on the question of Philippine in dependence in the shortest time possible.” The Filipino leaders were, however, not fooled by these empty promises. Nevertheless, they went into the motion of rejoicing over the announcement of Philippine “in dependence.” On January 30, 1943, Jorge B. Vargas pledged support of the Filipinos in the at tainment of in dependence, and on February 8, a rigged demonstration of gratitude to Japan for the promise of early in dependence was held in Manila. Not to be outdone in the staging of the grand comedy, the Council of State, with to ngue in cheek, issued a manifesto on February 26, exhorting the people to exert all efforts to wards the fulfillment of inde¬ pendence. The comedy went on and on with Premier Tozyo speaking on May 6, before the helpless masses of men and women at the New Luneta, saying that Japan would help the Filipinos “emerge from the chaos and turmoil of the past regime into the glorious national existence of the new.” Back in Tokyo, the Primier told the Imperial Diet that “we wish to go further and declare that we will accord the honor of in dependence to the Philippines” before the year was out. * ■ * V • V' '• The announcement was the cue to the Filipino of ficials to make preparations for the event. On June 18, the KALIBAPI (Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas) was in struct¬ ed to form the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Inde¬ pendence. The KALIBAPI promptly announced the composition of the body the next day. It was or ganized on June 20 with Jose P. Laurel as president and Benigno S. Aquino and Ramon Avancena as vice-presidents. The Commission then prepared the draft of the proposed Constitution, which was approved on September 4 and ratified by a “popular” convention two days THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 399 later. The Constitution provided for a unicameral National Assembly, whose delegates were chosen on September 20. The studied enthusiasm over the approaching in dependence was now climbing to its climax. On September 25, the National Assembly elected Jose P. Laurel President of the future Republic. Amidst the simulated applause and hurrahs of the Filipino audience who had no choice in the matter, the Declaration of Independence was read, the Republic in augurated, and President Laurel in ducted into of fice, October 14,1943. Thinking of a common effort to save the country from the tragedy that had befallen it, Laurel concluded his in augural ad¬ dress with these words: * * * I am sure our people will rise as one to meet the challenge * * * We shall encounter difficulties greater than any we have ever faced in our national history. We shall have to adapt ourselves to the strange stimuli of a new environment and undergo the travails of constant adjustment and readjustment. God helping us, we shall march with steady, resolute steps for ward, with out doubt, vacci- lation or fear. There shall be no tarrying on the way, no desertion from the ranks, no stragglers left behind. Together we shall work, work hard, work still harder, work with all our might, and work as we have never worked before. The Japanese authorities might not have known it, but the last sentence of Laurel’s in augural address was pregnant with resolve to demolish all barriers, in cluding Japanese in terference, standing in the way of real in dependence. His significant sen¬ tence: Every drop, every trickle of in dividual effort shall be grooved into a single channel of common endeavor until they grow into a flowing stream, a rushing cataract, a roaring to rrent, a raging flood, hurdling all difficulties and demolishing all barriers in the way of our single purpose and common determination to make our in¬ dependence stable, lasting and real. Economic Conditions.—Hours before the Japanese entered Manila, the restive masses, in cluding some of the supposedly educated, suddenly and brutally at tacked all grocery and sari- sari stores, carrying away all they could lay their hands on, in clud¬ ing such in edible things as beds, pillows, chairs, and even wooden benches. Men, women, and children, armed with lead pipes and clubs, rushed to the at tack howling and laughing. Doors were torn down and the contents of stores looted with gusto.

Within a few days, the looted goods were seen being peddled around in the streets and markets. The Japanese occupation was in famous not only because of the ferocity of the military conquerors, but also because the Filipinos as a whole had lost their social and moral balance. In Capas, where the Filipino soldiers were reconcentrated, thousands among the courageous Bataan defenders died not only because of malnutrition and the outbreak of diseases, but also because. some of the Filipino army physicians consciencelessly denied the suffering soldiers the medicine necessary to relieve them of their pain. When the Japanese authorities allowed the relatives and friends of the surrendered soldiers to send medicine and food, the same army physicians conveniently set aside the Hi- pocratic oath and engaged in the sale of food and medicine, particularly sulfathiazole, sulfanilamide, and quinine, which were, in the first place, not for them but for the ailing soldiers. The “Tragedy of Capas” consisted in the betrayal of the sick soldiers by their for tunate comrades-in-arms. Relatives and friends of sick soldiers, who had thoughtfully sent them food and medicine, believed they had done a good deed and hoped that, somehow, their unfortunate loved ones would be released in good physical condition. They were mistaken. The mer¬ chant-physicians, at least those in volved in the racket, kept the medicine and, the irony of it all, sold it at astronomical prices, in genuine Philippine pesos, to the very ones to whom the medicine was sent. Those who failed to receive their salaries before the surrender and consequently had no money died miserably. When the prisoners were released, they were either too sick to complain or too afraid to air their grievances. The dastardly crime was swamped by the urgent economic necessities and was soon for¬ gotten. The economic activities during the occupation were neces¬ sarily limited. Industry, commerce and trade suffered a set¬ back. Work animals decreased and agriculture, at least for some¬ time, languished. Horses, cars, trucks, and other means of trans¬ portation were confiscated by the Japanese; in exchange the THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 401 owners received a piece of paper with unreadable scribblings on it. The only consolation in receiving such pieces of paper w£ts that they could be used as cigarette paper. Many haciendas remained idle for a time. Then the Japanese planters came and planted them to cotton, a commodity needed by the Japanese war lords. Rice production sank to a new low, and the limited quantities produced were taken by the Japanelk military to feed their men. The natural upshot was the prohibitive price of rice. The people of Manila, not having an inch of agricultural land to their credit, suffered most. The lowly farmers, hitherto looked down upon by the bourgeoisie and the absentee. land¬ lords, rose in importance. It was a common experience to see the best furniture of the city being carted to the rural areas: the hitherto well-heeled capitalists and employees of Manila and other cities had to part with their pieces of furniture in exchange for a sack of rice. For a time, then, the yokels enjoyed the finer things of life. The shy barrio damsel now could be seen looking at herself in a large mirror of a narra aparador, imagining herself in the place of the young society debutante who had probably spent much time admiring herself before that very same mirror. The lowly takba and haul, repositories of yellowed dresses, were replaced by the best aparador. The old-fashioned dresses and shirts, too, were superseded by polo shirts and “modern” dresses bought from the secondhand dealers on Bambang and Anak ng Bayan Streets. In some cases, these dresses, polo shirts, and trousers were stolen from the in terred dead at La Loma and the North Cemeteries. Farmers who had lost a to oth or two now could afford to have gold teeth, the gold, in most cases, having been extracted by ghouls from the teeth of the dead in the ceme¬ teries. In the streets, especially on Azcarraga near the Dulong Bayan Market, men and women, mostly women, called out aloud: “Baka may gintong ngipin kayo riyan! Baka may gintong ngipin kayo!” — Do you have gold teeth with you? Do you have gold teeth? Meaning that they would buy your gold teeth. This demand for gold led the conscienceless and the unscrupulous to dig the graves or destroy the to mbs of the in nocent dead in the cemeteries for gold or for polo shirts and trousers. The desecration of the graves, punishable with death in pre-Spanish times, became common resulting, naturally, in the release of the in describable odor of decayed and decaying bodies. Because there was practically no production, most of the people engaged in the buy-and-sell business. Jewelry command¬ ed handsome prices, particularly to those who had amassed 402 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE for tunes in big buy-and-sell businesses. How many sacks of flour do you have? Do you have polo shirts for sale? Anything could be sold and purchased at prices which returned good pro¬ fits. The Japanese unwittingly encouraged this kind of business by manufacturing what the Filipinos called “Mickey Mouse” money. The result was in flation. One had to carry a bayong or small sack full of “Mickey Mouse” money to buy a few gantas of rice. Everything was sold at an astronomical price. A box of or dinary match cost, in 1944, more than a hundred “Mickey Mouse” pesos. The Japanese, however, tried to cushion the impact of their occupation on the economy of the country by distributing goods to the people at prices determined by the military authorities. But the Filipinos, who had learned much from the Chinese, became masters in the art of going around the law. A box of match from a distributing center cost no more than ten “Mickey Mouse” centavos. Outside, the recipients of the rations sold the in nocent box for, at the beginning of the occupation, thirty centavos. Cigarettes, too, became rare. American cigarettes commanded the highest prices"

In the circumstances, those who could not afford to buy at such prices manufactured their own cigarettes out of the dried papaya leaves. Cigarette paper disappeared and the people used the newspapers and books for their purpose. So common was this practice that wags boasted, “I am smoking the Encyclopedia Britannica!” The more imaginative among the Filipinos manufactured two kinds of cigarettes: the doctored cigarettes, which were not so bad, and the “American” cigarettes such as Camel, Chesterfield and Lucky Strike. Malabon, Rizal, was the manufacturing center of these “American” cigarettes. The deception was so complete that no one could distinguish, except the manufacturers them¬ selves, between a genuine Chesterfield and a fake one. Even the taste was so much alike that the Malabon impostors got away with their trade for quite a time. As to coffee and tea, the Filipinos had them, too. Coffee could be had at second hand, that is, the used grains of coffee were dried in the sun and sold to those who were willing to be suckers. Ersatz or substitute coffee or tea was common. Mango leaves, when boiled, became the substitute for tea. The best substitute for coffee were to asted rice and com. The uncooked rice or com was to asted to deep brown, boiled, and served hot. With sugar, the deception was complete. In view of the scarcity of food, President Laurel appealed THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 403 to the people to plant every inch of ground to vegetables. The people heeded him, and soon the sidewalks of Manila bloomed with vegetables. The low places where mosquitos found an ideal habitat became a source of food: the lowly kangkong. This aquatic vegetable saved thousands of lives, for it contains substances vital to physical growth. Food production campaign was in tensified under the direction of the National Food Pro¬ duction Campaign Office. The Economic Planning Board gave much of its time to the problem of production and procurement of rice and other prime necessities. As a result, the Bigasang Bayan (popularly known as BIBA) was or ganized to control the procurement and distribution of rice and other cereals. Con¬ sumers’ Cooperatives were created in Manila to allow private in itiative to help BIBA in its functions. To in sure equitable distribution of prime commodities, Laurel created the National Distribution Corporation (popularly known as NADISCO). All these steps were designed to alleviate the people’s suf¬ ferings. It is to the credit of Laurel and his colleagues in the government that, faced with what appeared as in surmountable tasks, they remained loyal to the people and worked hard to soften the impact of the Japanese occupation on the moral and physical nerves of the Filipinos. It is easy to criticize and con¬ demn him and his colleagues from a distance of 10,000 miles where there had not been any semblance of war, but those who remained knew better. Millions of those who suffered and con¬ fronted death face to face and survived were and are grateful to Laurel and his colleagues. They may have committed some mistakes, which were in evitable under the pircumstances, but their loyalty, patriotism, and unselfish devotion to duty were beyond reproach. Patrioteers who enjoyed the easy and good life in the United States during the grim war, who never knew what enemy occupation meant, who spoke volubly of freedom and democracy behind gleaming desks in air-conditioned rooms, who had no imagination to put the mselves in the position of men in occupied territories, — in short, men who had a false sense of pride and prejudice were quick to condemn acts they never understand. Such a man, who enjoyed the safety and luxury of the American mainland during the war, came to the Philippines with the liberation for ces and, looking over Mala- kanyang, boasted that those who collaborated with the Japanese would be jailed. An old man heard him and, turning to him with a benign smile, said softy: “Amang, had you been here during 404 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the enemy occupation you would have been the editor of the Japanese propaganda paper!” Social Conditions.—Life under the enemy occupation was most trying and dangerous. The men of the cities and plains had five mortal enemies: the Japanese military, diseases, the guerrillas, hunger, and the Japanese-paid Filipino spies. Escape in the circumstances was difficult, for the war hysteria made men unreasonable. Those who escaped unscathed could only be thankful and pray, after the liberation, that the Almighty had been merciful to them. When the Japanese succeeded in occupying the whole coun¬ try, the enemy Kempeitai (Military Police) began a career of wanton disregard of human lives. Houses with unregistered radios were raided and their occupants maimed and then thrown into the dungeons of Fort Santiago, where in human punish¬ ments were meted out to them as daily exercise. Punishments consisted of the “water cure”, the same technique that the early Americans in troduced in the Philippines. Hanging a suspected guerrilla by the hand, then hitting him with a four-by-four piece of wood, was executed with consummate skill. Oftentimes, the Japanese soldiers made a punching bag of a prisoner’s body. Worst of all, the to rmentors pressed red-hot iron or electric wire into the flesh of the helpless prisoner’s body.

Not a few brothers or husbands died fighting the beastly soldiers in defense of their sisters or wives. Those who could not fight back took to the mountains and joined the guerrillas.

Nobody could be sure that he would not meet disaster in any of the streets, for the Japanese sentries, strategically placed at most street comers, slapped men, women, and even children for failing to bow to them. The most feared Japanese word was kura, which meant two things to the Fili¬ pinos depending upon the movement of the Japanese hand: a “Kura!” with an in ward wave of the hand meant “Come here!”, which signified disaster; a “Kura!”' with an outward wave of the hand meant “Dismiss!” or “Scram!” Slapping was a common sight. A Filipino was slapped for not bringing his residence certificate with him. He was slapped for not bowing properly to the sentry. He was slapped for not being understood by a Japanese sentry. He was slapped for having a face the Japanese did not like. This slapping propensity of the Japanese may be common to them and may not mean much to them, but to the Filipino it is an in sult. To him slapping is a sign of condescension. He prefers to be boxed. To slap him is to say that he is in ferior as a man; only women, in his estimation, are slapped. And so the Japanese military, who did not make any at tempt to study Filipino psychology, failed to win the confidence and sympathy of the Filipinos. It is true, as the Japanese the mselves suspected, that almost all Filipinos were guerrillas. Side by side with the danger of Japanese presence was the spy. One may escape the brutality of the enemy, but one was confronted with the presence of spies one did not know. In his enthusiasm over the results of a naval battle, for in stance, a Filipino might whisper to another the defeat of the Japanese navy. Or he might whisper, quite in nocently, “The Kano are coming!” in the belief that all Filipinos were pro-Americans. This bad logic sometimes resulted in the execution of the naive who gloated prematurely over the victory of the American navy. So a prudent Filipino talked only to his close friends about the war and about the return of Mac Arthur. The guerrillas, on the other hand, were quick to liquidate Filipinos whom they suspected of collaboration. To the resist¬ ance men, it was enough that one succumbed, at the point of the bayonet, to enemy promises to be considered pro-Japanese. Many guerrillas were unreasonable and unreasoning and saw only their points, not of others. Thus, a guerrilla outfit, labor- 406 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE ing under a colossal misunderstanding, took potshots at Jose P. Laurel and critically wounded him. Other outfits or dered the liquidation of men they did not like in the name of free¬ dom and democracy. The Filipinos in the cities and plains, the refore, feared the guerrillas as much as they feared the Kem- peitai. And yet, with out those who stayed in the cities and to wns the guerrillas would have had a bad time making both ends meet, for even those who engaged in the buy-and-sell business con¬ tributed heavily, directly or in directly, to the coffers of the guerrilla outfits. Owing to economic dislocation and the scarcity of food, thousands died of malaria, malnutrition, tuberculosis, and other diseases. Medicine, too, was scarce. Sulfathiazole, the wonder drug of the period, commanded an impossible price. In the streets could be seen men, women, and children suffering from either extreme hunger or tropical ulcer with hundred of flies feasting on the large fresh wounds. Men, women and children, their faces deathly white and their lips parched, scrounged the garbage cans in the public markets and in the streets to salvage anything that could take the place of food. Many died on the sidewalks, their identity unknown. Hundreds were executed by the Japanese for stealing food or anything that could be sold in the buy-and-sell mart. To the hungry and the desperate only courage remained: it took a great deal of physical courage to steal from the Japanese knowing, as they did, that death was the recompense for such an at tempt. Many took the chances, and some escaped the enemy; others were less for tunate and died heroically in the desire to make their families less hungry and destitute. Such a condition naturally produced social derelicts. Crimes against persons and property multiplied. Burglary and holdups were common occurrences. The law-enforcement agencies were helpless not only because the agents of the law had no weapons with which to frighten burglars and other criminals into sub¬ mission, but also because they understood the temper of the period"

They the mselves were hungry and were they not agents of the law they would probably have turned to the highway to rob and, in the emergency, to kill in or der to survive in a highly competitive and hostile surrounding. All was not bleak, however. There was, to be sure, light and music. There were night clubs and restaurants where the new bourgeoisie and plutocrats spent their waking hours plotting THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 407 new business ventures or planning a business coup. There were, too, stage presentations consisting mainly of slapstick comedies in which some courageous actors rediculed the Japanese soldiers. One, who played the role of a Japanese sentry, decorated his two arms with genuine wrist watches — an acidic commentary on the Japanese military who for cibly confiscated wrist watches and wore them on both arms. That courageous actor did not stay long on the stage: he was promptly arrested and to rtured in Fort Santiago. But he gave the people at least a few minutes of genuine laughter. From the social and economic points of view, the Japanese occupation resulted, first, in the rise of a new bourgeoisie whose antecedents were but dimly outlined. They were the men who, though not exactly well bred, had raw courage and imagination in business and were ruthless enough to deal with both the Japan¬ ese and the Filipinos. Second, the rise of this new bourgeoisie led to the breakdown of the old social-elite class. Heretofore, the social Elites came from the old, respectable, and wealthy land-owning families. With the enemy occupation, these elites no longer held the monopoly of the social circle; it was broken by the rushing in of the new rich. The result was the demo¬ cratization of the old, stiff upper-class society. Lastly, the pyramid of Filipino society widened at the base, for more people descended to the depths and became the social problems of the post-war era. No doubt the grim experience of the war years, wherein society became a wilderness ruled by the law of the jungle, made most men ruthless and materialistic. They would not want to be the victims once more of conditions and situations that would make them helpless pawns in the social struggle. Hence the in tensification of graft and corruption which began with the distribution of relief goods during the first post-war year and which ramified into the diverse sources of “easy” money, such as the disposition of the equipment and materials left in the Philippines after the war by the American armed for ces. Cultural Aspects.—-Aside from slapstick comedies present¬ ed before pleasure-hungry populace, there were the movie the at ers which presented pre-war American films. These films, however, were previously censored by the authorities to make sure that they were of the harmless type. In between presentations of American films were Japanese films glorifying the Japanese war machine and way of life — certainly the kind of propaganda materials that the Filipino audience got tired of because of their banality. 408 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE More serious in purpose, however, were the plays staged at the old Metropolitan Theater. In 1943, a group of college actors for med the Dramatic Philippines, Inc., whose purpose was to bring to the stage some popular plays in English. These plays were adapted into Tagalog. The response of the public was tremendous. Dramatic critics and near-critics hailed the Dramatic Philippines the white hope of the stage. Under the society’s management and direction, such plays as Passion Play, Applesauce, Seven Keys to Baldpate, Cyrano de Bergerac, The Husband of Mrs. Cruz, Julius Caesar, Golden Boy, all adapted into Tagalog, and Sa Pula, Sa Putt\\ and adaptation of Julian Cruz Balmaseda’s Isang Kuwaltang Abaka, won the hearts of even the so-called “bakya crowd.” Good music by classical composers was furnished by Musical Philippines, Inc.; a sister or ganization of Dramatic Philippines, Inc., which presented severed concerts at the Metropolitan Theater. One concert, a marimba solo by a Japanese musician, made the Filipino audience for get the nationality of the soloist owing to his brilliant and sensitive performance, although once in a while a few among the boors giggled softly at the sight of the soloist jumping like a frog in an at tempt to reach the farthest bars. Such concerts provided the people, the elite as well as the masses, with enjoyment, no matter how fleeting, which made them for get temporarily the rigors and cruelties of the war. + * Filipino literature in English was moribund during the enemy occupation. The Japanese discouraged the Filipinos from writing in English by suppressing, on the one hand, the magazine section of the Manila Tribune, the only English daily at the time, and by encouraging the writers in Tagalog, on the other. As the of ficial language, Tagalog became popular and some writers in English, who could not sell their literary wares to the Tribune and the Philippine Review, began to wrestle with Tagalog in or der to write in it and earn a little to make both ends meet.

Ishikawa promised that with the Liwayway, the only Tagalog weekly allowed to continue publication under the Japanese thumb, the writers would be paid handsomely. The promise was fulfilled, and scores of writers began to manu- THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION 409 facture short stories and verses a la Japanese haikku. There was no freedom of expression and, consequently, the writers were limited in their subject matter. The favorite sub¬ ject was the rural scene, a subject that was neglected in pre¬ war days. Considering the time and circumstance, the occu¬ pation period nevertheless produced some' good writing, mostly in the short story. The Japanese civilian authorities, who had read the English resume of all the materials published, were impressed and appointed a committee to choose the best stories. The result was an anthology entitled Ang 25 Pinakamabuting Maikling Kathang Pilipino ng 1943 (The Twenty-five Best Fili¬ pino Short Stories of 1943), published in 1944. Among the half dozen or so magazines that the Japanese published, two became popular: the Philippine Review and Pillars. The for mer published all types of literature, from poems to historical articles and pure propaganda materials. The Pillars, on the other hand, though not as popular as the Review, never¬ the less became the refuge of those in dire need of a few hundred pesos to purchase a kilo of coffee-corn or a few pieces of roasted coconut meat, which passed for chestnut. The cultural scene, the refore, was dismal. The important prerequisite for the development and eventual flowering of art and letters, namely, freedom of expression and of the press, was lacking. The writer’s hands were tied and he could move them barely enough to portray or depict harmless subjects, for example, a rural scene, in the manner of Fernando Amorsolo. But a searching criticism of life, of which literature is the pur¬ veyor, there was none. Nonetheless, it must be admitted that the Japanese, more than the Americans, encouraged the develop¬ ment of Tagalog and gave to it an impetus never before wit¬ ness ed. Whether their purpose was selfish or not is immaterial. The fact remains that the Japanese helped the writer in Tagalog re-discover the beauty and the potentialities of his native language. 22 THE “LIBERATION” The three years of Japanese occupation were also years of resistance movement. Even before the Japanese entry into Ma¬ nila, guerrilla units had already been for med in anticipation of what was then believed as the short stay of enemy in the Phil¬ ippines. When Bataan and Corregidor fell, quite a number of Filipino and American of ficers and soldiers succeeded in escaping to the mountains and there directed the underground movement. Sabotage on large and small scale, aimed at the paralyzing the Japanese war efforts, was conducted. Reports of enemy move¬ ments, losses, strength, and disposition of troops were sent to Mac Arthur’s headquarters in Australia. These reports helped Mac Arthur immensely in planning his return to the Philippines. He knew exactly where to land and what to expect from the enemy. The long wait ended when the American for ces hit the beach of Leyte in October 1944. Other landings were made in Mindoro, Batangas, and Lingayen in subsequent months. On February 3, 1945, elements of the American army entered Manila. Pursuit of the enemy followed. On August 15, Japan surrendered, and on September 2 the terms of surrender were signed on the battleship Missouri at Tokyo Bay. The war in the Pacific was over. Guerrilla Warfare.- The day following the enemy occupa¬ tion of Manila, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army warned the Filipinos against “of fering resistance or committing hostile acts against the Japanese for ces in any manner”. Any such act on the part of the Filipinos would lead to the destruc¬ tion of the Philippines. The Japanese proclamation threatened with death those who would “disturb the minds of the of ficials and the people.” The severity of the proclamation cowed ma¬ jority of the Filipinos into silence. Those who refused to place the mselves under the authority of the Japanese Military Ad¬ ministration fled to the mountains to join the guerrillas. The Japanese threat of death to those who refused to co¬ operate with them was obviously a reaction to the well-known 410 THE “LIBERATION” 411 Filipino-American democratic partnership. The Japanese knew that the Filipinos loved the Americans and the announcement that the Filipinos would be allowed to developed their culture and that the Philippines was for the Filipinos was a part of the Japan¬ ese gamble to alienate the for mer’s affection from the Americans. But the ways of the Japanese military neutralized their propa¬ ganda line of making the Philippines an important part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This explains why a great majority of the Filipinos turned guerrillas and potential guerrillas. With the retreat of the USAFFE to Bataan, the of ficers and soldiers who were isolated by the rapid advance of the enemy or ganized guerrilla units. In the north, Walter M. Cushing for med a guerrilla outfit consisting of the 121 st Infantry; Colonel Guillermo Nakar commanded the 14 th Infantry; and Colonel Parker Calvert the 43 rd Infantry. By July 1942, the North Luzon guerrilla units were tightly knit and by September active resistance movement commenced. Cushing’s underground activities came to an end when, on September 19, 1942, while in Jones, Isabela, with three Filipino soldiers on a mission to contact a large guerrilla outfit, he and his men were fired upon by Japanese soldiers. Cushing and two of his men died on the spot. Cushing and his band had killed 500 enemy soldiers along the coast of Ilocos before his death.

The death of Cushing did not dampen the enthusiasm of the northern Luzon guerrillas. Governor Roque Ablan of Ilocos Norte refused to surrender to the enemy and with drew to the mountains where he or ganized his own guerrilla unit. Captain Praeger commanded the sector between Apayao and Cagayan, while Lt. Rufino Baldwin led the underground movement in Benguet. Along the mountain trail, in and about Baguio, Bado Dangwa led his resistance fighters against the Japanese. Even¬ tually, the north Luzon guerrillas were consolidated under the over-all command of Colonel Russell W. Volckmann. However, other guerrilla units under separate commands mushroomed, principally Lapham’s guerrillas, Ramsey’s guerrillas, Ander¬ son’s guerrillas, and Colonel Claude Thorpe’s guerrillas or gan¬ ization in Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija. In Central Luzon, the guerrillas flocked under the banner of several leaders, some of whom were civilians. In and around Manila, Miguel Ver and, later, Eleuterio Adevoso, led the Hunt¬ er’s ROTC guerrillas, and Marcos Agustm, assisted by Yay Pan- 412 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE lilio, led the Marking’s guerrillas. In Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulakan, and Nueva Ecija, the dominant guerrilla outfit was the HUK- BALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bay an Laban sa Hapon), led by Luis Taruc. Anderson’s guerrillas also operated around Manila. In Southern Luzon, the PQOG (President Quezon’s Own Guerrillas) operated in Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon, while in the Bicol region for mer Assemblyman and Governor, Wenceslao Q. Vinzons, headed the guerrilla outfit. In the Visayas, the most prominent guerrilla leaders were Colonel Ruperto Kangleon, who operated in Samar and Leyte; Colonel Macario Peralta, of Tarlac, led the Panay guerrillas, with Governor Tomas Confesor as the civilian leader. In Min¬ danao, the guerrillas were headed by Tomas Cabili, Wendell Fertig, and Salipada Pendatun. Jesuit priests in Mindanao - Fathers Edward Haggerty, John Pollock, Clement Risacher, Har¬ old Murphy, and others — did much to alleviate the condition of the people suffering from the effects of the war. They suf¬ fered with them and consoled them in the darkest hour when hope was all but extinguished. To these guerrilla padres, no less than to the leaders of the armed units, belonged the dis¬ tinction of having kept alive the spirit of the resistance to the enemy at a time when all seemed lost. The history of the resistance movement in the Philippines would fill several huge volumes. What they did to keep alive faith in the democratic way of life is a story that is as to uching as it is dramatic. Yet, in keeping alive that faith in freedom and democracy, some of the guerrillas committed at rocious crimes which, under the circumstances, can be for given, for in a tumultuous and abnormal period there is hardly time to ra¬ tion alize and to think clearly. Passion rules the moment and reason is pushed into the background. Thus at such a period it is difficult for men to behave like human beings; the matter of life and death is too urgent for a person to behave and stay like one. The guerrillas performed three important functions: to ambush or otherwise kill enemy soldiers and civilians; to relay important in telligence reports to Mac Arthur in Australia, such as size of the enemy army, troop movements, number of Japan¬ ese ships, disposition of troops, activities of the Japanese Mili¬ tary Administration, and other in for mation necessary to guage the strength and weakness of the enemy; and to liquidate spies and Japanese sympathizers. Many guerrillas met death in the THE LIBERATION” 413 performance of their duties, but those left behind carried on as if nothing happened. There was only one thought uppermost in their minds, and it was to help drive away the in vaders from Philippine soil. Guerrilla Newspapers.*—Truthful news report about the war was impossible under the enemy, for the press and the radio were controlled. It was natural that the Japanese should resort to propaganda lies to achieve their purpose of demoralizing the Filipinos and of making them believe in the in vincibility of Japan. People who read the Tribune and other Japanese-con¬ trolled magazines read between the lines, but such reading was not sufficient to slake their thirst for real news. Two ways were open to the Filipinos to get real news: first, by tuning in their radios to Radio San Francisco at the risk of being caught in the act and then beheaded by the enemy; and second, by reading, also at the risk of being beheaded, the guerrilla “newspapers.” The only limited contact the Filipinos had with the outside world was with Radio San Francisco. Beamed to the Philip¬ pines, Radio San Francisco broadcast news about the war in Europe and in Asia and events of general in terest, particularly to Filipinos. Though the Japanese authorities or dered the re¬ conditioning and registration of all radios, some Filipinos courageously violated the Japanese law in or der to get the real news from the other side of the Pacific. The Japanese tech¬ nicians tried to disturb the reception of the news by clogging the air lanes, but somehow the news came through with suf¬ ficient clarity to be written down and disseminated to many who were prepared to risk their lives. Typewritten or mimeo¬ graphed copies of these news items were made and distributed secretly to the people. Many of these news items were copied and reprinted by the guerrilla “newspapers.” The need for keeping up the faith in the democratic tra¬ dition and for counteracting Japanese propaganda led some guerrilla outfits to put out their “newspapers.” These were not printed but mimeographed, sometimes, typewritten. Colonel Guillermo Nakar, operating in the Sierra Madre near Nueva Vizcaya, put out the mimeographed newspaper Matang Law in (Hawk’s Eye)"

This paper, aside from giving news about the last days of Bataan, also in for med the people that like the hawk, the guerrillas would watch over the welfare of the peo¬ ple and at the same time take cognizance of the activities of the 414 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE spies. One of the most widely-circulated guerrilla papers was The Liberator, put out and edited by Leon O. Ty of the Philip¬ pines Free Press. Bom in 1944, The Liberator circulated in Cavite, Manila, Rizal and Bulakan. Some of its writers were caught by the Japanese circulating the little news magazine and were executed, but Ty and a few of his companions escaped the enemy dragnet. Earlier in 1943, a typewritten newspaper, The Flash, came out in Tagalog, Spanish, and English. Pedro de la Liana, a writer who became prominent in the 1920’s, edited the paper. It had a sprinkling of news about the war and articles de¬ nouncing the Japanese Military Administration. Ironically enough, Pedro de la Liana was mistaken for a collaborator and liquidated by the uninformed guerrillas. In Pampanga and else¬ where in Central Luzon, the powerful guerrilla or ganization, the HUKBALAHAP, put out the newspaper Ing Masala (The Light). Edited in Arayat, it circulated among the peasants as early as October 1942. Ing Masala was so effective that the peasants of Pampanga and Tarlac for ged a unity that made the or ganization the most powerful in Central Luzon. Another in¬ fluential paper of Luzon was the Thunderclap, which was used by the Hunters ROTC as its or gan. It came out in 1943 and changed its place of publication of ten to confuse the Japanese as to its place of or igin. A day before the Americans entered Manila, February 2, 1945, the paper changed its name to Li¬ berty. Panay had several guerrilla papers. Most famous was the Kalibo War Bulletin which came out after Pearl Harbor. It had the widest circulation in the entire island of Panay and lived up to 1944 when paper and newsprint became very scarce. Meanwhile, Tomas Confesor, governor of Free Panay, put out his bilingual (Hiligaynon-English) paper Ang Tigbatas (The Common People). This newspaper survived the war and be¬ came fhe principal reading matter of the people of Panay. Other newspapers in Panay were Coordinator, Harbinger, Chronicle, and the Unknown Soldiers. In Sorsogon, Juan Frivaldo pub¬ lished The Commentator, which came out only when its publish¬ er received news from the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Wences- lao Q. Vinzons popularized and wrote for The Saber, or gan of the ROTC guerrillas in the Bicol provinces and Laguna. Other guerrilla papers were The Bugle of Leyte, the Kalayaan of Bu¬ lakan, and the Palaso of Manila. THE “LIBERATION” 415 The number of guerrilla papers published showed to what extent the Filipinos hated the enemy. There was no mistaking the fact that they never for a moment doubted the ability of the Americans to come back and finish off the Japanese as ex¬ pressed in the now famous “I shall return” of Mac Arthur. The risks taken by those who wrote for and prepared the newspapers and the handicaps and difficulties met in the circumstances testified to the high resolve of the people to fight the enemy of their freedom and the sanctity of their homes and women. The national experience of having undergone during the Spanish period similar privations, brutalities, and lack of respect for persons and property, in stinctively gave them the courage and the hope with which to live dangerously in the shadow of the enemy. The Govemment-in-Exile.—When Quezon and his party left Corregidor in February 1942, they did not proceed directly to Australia. They visited several islands in the Visayas, which were still free, and boosted the morale of the people. From Negros the Quezon party proceeded to Oroquieta, Misamis, and here waited for the airplane that would take them to Australia. Practical and farsighted that he had always been, Quezon, think¬ ing of death, issued an Executive Order naming Colonel Manuel A. Roxas President of the Commonwealth upon his and Os- mena’s death. In the evening of March 26, two American bomb¬ ers took Quezon and his party to Australia. On April 19, the party left for the United States on board the ship President Coolidge. While in the United States, Quezon addressed the Senate and House of Representatives. The Government of the Commonwealth was now in Washington as an exile. Quezon appointed members of his Washington Cabinet: General Basilio Valdes, Secretary of National Defense; Manuel Nieto, Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce; Jaime Hernandez, Secretary of Finance; and Joaquin Elizalde, Resident Commissioner. Being a govemment-in-exile, the of ficials and personnel could not do more than boost the morale of the Filipinos some 12,000 miles across the vast Pacific. Quezon, however, participated in the Pacific War Council of which he was a member and later on signed the agreement providing for the or ganization of the United Nations. Because of the war conditions, it was felt that Quezon should continue to serve as President beyond the eight-year limit placed on the President’s and the Vice-President’s terms of of fice by 416 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Constitution. Senator Millard Tydings, co-author of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Independence Act, had pointed out that Presi¬ dent Quezon’s term of of fice would expire on November 15, 1943 and that by the operation of the Philippine Constitution Osmena would succeed him. Quezon wanted to continue as President even beyond the term provided for by the Constitu¬ tion, but some of the men around him felt that Osmena should succeed him in accordance with the highest law of the land"

      "context": ". The Government of the Commonwealth was now in Washington as an exile. Quezon appointed members of his Washington Cabinet: General Basilio Valdes, Secretary of National Defense; Manuel Nieto, Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce; Jaime Hernandez, Secretary of Finance; and Joaquin Elizalde, Resident Commissioner. Being a govemment-in-exile, the of ficials and personnel could not do more than boost the morale of the Filipinos some 12,000 miles across the vast Pacific. Quezon, however, participated in the Pacific War Council of which he was a member and later on signed the agreement providing for the or ganization of the United Nations. Because of the war conditions, it was felt that Quezon should continue to serve as President beyond the eight-year limit placed on the President’s and the Vice-President’s terms of of fice by 416 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the Constitution. Senator Millard Tydings, co-author of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Independence Act, had pointed out that Presi¬ dent Quezon’s term of of fice would expire on November 15, 1943 and that by the operation of the Philippine Constitution Osmena would succeed him. Quezon wanted to continue as President even beyond the term provided for by the Constitu¬ tion, but some of the men around him felt that Osmena should succeed him in accordance with the highest law of the land. Osmena, however, thought that there must be unity in the ranks and knowing that Quezon wanted to continue as President he prepared a resolution to the. American Congress asking that the provisions of the Constitution regarding succession be waived, so as to make Quezon President even beyond the eight-year limit. The resolution was passed by the Senate on November 9, 1943, and the following day the House of Representatives voted for its approval. Thus Quezon continued to remain at the top of the Commonwealth Government. His health, how¬ ever, had been failing and less than a year later, on August 1, 1944, he died at Saranac Lake, New York. Osmena then suc¬ ceeded to the Presidency. Battle of the Philippine Sea.—The year 1944 was crucial for the combatants in the Pacific. Slowly and painfully, the American naval and marine for ces in ched their way north from the vicinity of Australia. Saipan and Tinian Islands were bombarded by the American fleet and marines in June and land¬ ings in Guam were made the reafter. Meanwhile, a huge naval battle was shaping up in the Philippine Sea off the Pacific coast. In mid-June, the Japanese fleet, composed of carriers, battle¬ ships, cruisers, and destroyers, rushed to ward the Marianas to relieve the Japanese garrisons there. Admiral Raymond Spruance, commanding the American Fifth Fleet, waited for the enemy west of the Marianas. At the same time, he sent carrier-based airplanes to at tack Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima to neutralize the Japanese bases in the islands. On June 19, the Battle of the Philippine Sea began. The battle, which was fought up to June 20, was primarily an air combat. The air battles started over Guam, with Admiral Marc A. Mitcher’s Task Force 58 carrying the brunt of the at tack. The result of the two air battles over Guam was the destruction of 402 enemy airplanes as against seventeen American airplanes lost and four ships damaged. With the destruction of a great majority of the enemy’s carrier-based airplanes, the American fleet rushed westward in an at tempt to lure the Japanese ships out. Search planes were sent to deter- THE “LIBERATION” 417 mine the enemy’s position. Contact with the enemy fleet was made in the afternoon of June 20. It was late in the afternoon, but the American bombers and fighters rushed to the at tack and sank two enemy carriers, two destroyers, and one tanker, and severely damaged three carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, one destroyer, and three tankers. The Americans suffered sixteen planes shot down and seventy-three planes lost owing to lack of fuel and crash landing. The Battle of the Philippine Sea prevented the Japanese from reinforcing the Marianas, on the one hand, and led to the subsequent capture of the islands by the Americans, on the other. In Manila, the Japanese put out a small or “pony” edition of the Tribune describing in broad outlines the alleged destruc¬ tion of the American fleet. No Filipino, however, was fooled by such reporting. Subsequent “pony” editions carrying the news about the defeat of the American naval for ces were brought out, but the Filipinos described such alleged Japanese victories as “Tribune victories.” The Road to Leyte.—After the battle of the Philippine Sea, the American naval and marine for ces concentrated their wrath on Saipan, which was captured on July 9. Guam and Rota Islands were heavily bombarded at the same time, and on July 21 the American marines landed on Guam, which fell, after heavy fighting, on August 10. The “skip-and-jump” operations netted the Americans Tinian Island, which fell on August 8, the coast of New Guinea, Wake Island, which fell on May 19, Biak Island, and the Western Carolines. American territorial losses during the early phase of the war were now being recovered, and the way to the Philippines was being paved. Carrier planes softened the Japanese positions in Iwo Jima, the Palau Islands, the Peleliu and the Angar Islands. In the Southwest Pacific, Mac Arthur’s for ces occupied Morotai Island, and struck at northern Celebes, Halmahera, Ceram, and Vogelkop. By the middle of 1944, the American for ces were in a position to tighten the noose around Japan’s neck. On September 21, while Manila was listening to the Japanese-controlled Radio Station PIAM, the American carrier based planes swooped down upon the city undetected. The air at tack coincided with the Japanese target practice, so that both the Japanese and the Filipinos were unaware of the presence of American planes above. Heavy damage was in flicted on Japanese in stallations in and around Manila, Cavite, the Japanese shipping in the bay, and troop concentrations. Similar air strikes were undertaken in the Visayas by airplanes 418 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of the Third Fleet under the command of Admiral William F. “Bull” Halsey. This carrier strike led Admiral Halsey to the conclusion that the in vasion of the Philippines must begin in Leyte and not in Mindanao, as or iginally contemplated by Mac- Arthur. The strikes showed that the Japanese air resistance was weak in the Visayas. Moreover, Halsey suggested the acceleration of the date of in vasion to prevent the enemy from strengthening his defenses in the weak areas. Consequently, with the approval of President Roosevelt, the date for the in vasion of Leyte was set for October 20.

The way was now paved for the “return of the beloved.” The Leyte Landings.—The landings in the Philippines were to be carried out by the for ces under General Mac Arthur. Such a task meant the convergence of troop transports, supply ships, fire support ships, escort carriers, mine craft, landing craft, and cargo ships. The American for ces, known as the Central Philippine Attack Force, were divided into the Northern Attack Force and the Southern Attack Force. All in all, the American at tack force consisted of 650 ships and four army divisions. The softening of the enemy positions on Leyte was carried out by carrier strikes which lasted from October 9 to 20. At the same time, similar raids were conducted on Pescadores, For¬ mosa, and northern Luzon in or der to paralyze Japanese ac¬ tivities and defenses. Central Luzon took a share of the carrier at tack on October 18 and 19, while units of the American navy scoured the seas in the Visayas to prevent the Japanese navy from in terfering with operations in Leyte. On October 11, the long line of American at tack force left New Guinea. Target: Leyte. Minesweepers preceded the main at tack force. On October 20, the Leyte beaches were severely bombarded from the air and from the sea. The small islands guarding the entrances to Leyte were secured on the same day. Channels and landing beaches were immediately cleared of mines. With file enemy neutralized by heavy bombings and naval guns, two army crops landed in the morning of October 20. Beach¬ heads were established and soon the troops fanned out in several directions to drive out the enemy. The Americans had returned. The Battle for Leyte Gulf.—The Leyte landings brought home to the Japanese naval and military authorities the urgent menace those landings presented to them. Admiral Soemu To- yoda, Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, had “Sho Opera- THE “LIBERATION” 419 tion” put into effect. The “Sho Operation” envisaged control of the air and the neutralization of the American menace. It was thought to counterattack by air and naval ships in or der to destroy the American fleet guarding and protecting the Leyte beachheads. For this purpose three naval for ces were to con¬ verge on Leyte Gulf: the Northern Force, under Admiral Ji- saburo Ozawa, was to sail from Japan, down the eastern coast of Luzon, and on to Leyte Gulf; the Central Force, under Admi¬ ral Takeo Kurita, was to steam through San Bernardino Strait and on to Leyte Gulf; and the Southern Force, divided into two groups, one under Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura and the other under Admiral Kiyohide Shima, was to reach Leyte Gulf through the Surigao Strait. The Battle for Leyte Gulf, the greatest naval battle in his¬ tory, was fought simultaneously in three different places from October 24 to 26. In its magnitude and significance, the Battle for Leyte Gulf exceeded all previous naval combat, in cluding the Battle of Jutland during World War I. The Battle of Surigao Strait.—The Japanese Southern Force, coming from Singapore, entered the narrow Surigao Strait in the darkest hours of October 25. The American task force, headed by Rear Admiral J. B. Oldendorf, waited for the enemy* in complete silence. The Japanese commander, not suspecting that his approach had been discovered, continued steaming down ' the strait with self-confidence. At the precise moment when the enemy ships were within range of the American heavy guns, Oldendorf gave the signal to at tack. First the PT boats, then the cruisers, the destroyers, and the battleships, at tacked with such fury that Admiral Nishimura did not know what hit him. He or dered star shells fired into the air to see the enemy, but the shells unfortunately fell between the combatants, the reby giving Oldendorf a good sight of the Japanese. The merry battle, wherein the Japanese ships were completely trapped, resulted in the almost to tal annihilation of the Southern Force. On the American side, only one destroyer was severely damaged. The Battle off Samar.—On October 24, when the Amer¬ ican naval in telligence discovered that a strong Japanese force was steaming for San Bernardino Strait, planes of the Third Fleet at tacked the Japanese Central Force under Admiral Kurita. The enemy suffered severe losses before he could reach the strait. Some turned back, but the survivors doggedly proceeded to the strait with out having been detected by the Americans. At 420 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE daybreak of October 25, the Central Force, having penetrated the strait, at tacked Admiral C. A. F. Sprague’s weak escort carriers. After a running battle, Sprague retreated to ward Leyte Gulf, still fighting with everything he had. Planes from Sprague’s escort carriers and to rpedoes from destroyers prevented the Japanese from pursuing their advantage. After two and a half hours of in tense firing on both sides, Kurita retired to ward San Bernardino Strait. With the help of aircraft from the Third Fleet, Sprague’s escort-carrier planes pursued the enemy in the afternoon of October 25, sinking two heavy cruisers and one destroyer. The following day, the pursuit continued, and Kurita suffered one destroyer sunk and several ships damaged or sunk. The Americans, too, suffered heavy losses in this engagement, but Leyte Gulf was secured for the Americans.

He sent his planes in search of this fleet. In the afternoon of October 24, the planes found the Northern Force coming from Japan. Admiral Ozawa’s in tention was to draw Admiral Halsey’s fleet from the vicinity of Leyte Gulf in or der to allow the Central Force and the Southern Force to sneak into the gulf and destroy Admiral Sprague’s weak force. Halsey took the bait and pursued Ozawa, leaving San Bernardino Strait unguarded. The pursuit led Hal¬ sey to a point near Cape Engano in northern Luzon. The naval battle off Cape Engano was fought on October 25, with planes and ships participating. At the moment when Halsey was murdering Ozawa, he received the news that the Central Force had penetrated the San Bernardino Strait and was giving Admiral Sprague a big headache. He consequently detached fast battle¬ ships and carriers and sent them posthaste to Leyte Gulf. This contingent pursued Kurita’s fleet as it entered the San Bernardino Strait on its way out of the battle. On October 26, the remnants of the Japanese fleet were wiped out by planes of the Third Fleet. The men of the Third Fleet, who saw Halsey dispatch a part of his fleet to Leyte Gulf after receiving Sprague’s urgent cry for help, called the operation the “Battle of Bull’s Run,” referring to Halsey’s familiar nickname, “Bull.” By October 26, the refore, Leyte Gulf was safe in American hands. The battle was decisive, for had the Japanese succeeded in destroying the American fleet at the gulf Mac Arthur’s army THE ‘LIBERATION” 421 in Leyte would have been wiped out and the “liberation” of the Philippines would have been much delayed, if not completely frustrated. The Landings at Lingayen Gulf.- Preparatory to the recapture of Manila, Mac Arthur’s for ces landed on the southwest coast of Mindoro in mid-December 1944. This maneuver left the enemy at a disadvantage, for his shipping lanes through the South China Sea were threatened. Carrier strikes in the Manila Bay area fooled the Japanese into believing that American landings would be made in that area. On January 9, 1945, the Americans unexpectedly landed at Lingayen Gulf, the reby taking the enemy by surprise. The Japanese could not of fer stiff resistance, parti¬ cularly because the number of their airplanes had dwindled and because it was difficult to defend the plains of Pangasinan. With the enemy disconcerted, the Americans landed at San Fabian. The liberation for ces now fanned out almost with out resistance to Central Luzon. Meanwhile, the Japanese, in des¬ peration, retreated to the mountains, while those in Manila prepared for a last-ditch battle. The Liberation of Manila.--Once Mac Arthur’s for ces had set foot on Lingayen they relentlessly moved down south. It was imperative that Manila be captured with out delay, for the city of fered excellent harbor facilities. Consequently, amphibious operations were carried out in Batangas; another assault force succeeded in putting ashore an army corps at the San Narciso area in Zambales. The move was obviously designed to cut off the Bataan Peninsula. By noon the troops were in Subic. Subic Bay was secured with out any opposition on January 30. Meanwhile in Manila, the Japanese marines began a series of at rocities which led to the death of thousands of the inha¬ bitants. The rapidity with which the American troops were coming down the main highway to Manila in furiated the enemy. Men found in the streets were for cibly taken and compelled to work in Japanese airfields or in stallations. Horses, carts, trucks, and cars were confiscated and used for transporting Japanese soldiers and materials from one place to another. At least one hospital, the Quezon Institute, which was moved to the San Juan de Dios Hospital in 1942, was sacked by the Japanese and its patients and doctors massacred in cold blood. Houses and build¬ ings were set on fire and their occupants shot. Manila was a city of conflagration. The same at rocious deeds were perpetrated 422 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE in the provinces obviously as a vengeance for not collaborating with the Japanese. From Tarlac, the American army knifed its way rapidly to Pampanga, Bulakan, and, finally, to the outskirts of Manila. Between 5:30 and 6:00 P. M. of February 3, 1945, the advanced elements of the American for ces entered Manila. There were few Filipinos who met the Americans, for most of them were in doors for fear of Japanese at rocity. A tank unit promptly rushed to the University of Santo Tomas campus and liberated the American and Allied prisoners. In the darkness of the night, the prisoners, all pale shadows of their for mer selves, sang “God Bless America”, followed by the “Star Spangled Banner”. In a moment the night was filled with jubilant voices giving thanks to the Glory of God in the Highest. The Return of the Commonwealth.—The heavy rains did not deter the American troops from pursuing the enemy in Leyte. When it was finally determined that a large part of the island was in American hands, Mac Arthur or dered the or ganization of civil municipal government. The temporary seat of the Com¬ monwealth Government was established in Tacloban, Leyte, on October 23, 1944. On November 15, 1944, on the ninth anniversary of the Commonwealth, President Sergio Osmena addressed the Filipinos, saying in part: “The cause of democracy and liberty, the right of every people to govern itself and to be secure against aggression, the great moral issues of justice and righteousness and human dignity are being fought in the Philip¬ pines to day.

I am also proud of the way the Filipinos are aiding in that fight.” On February 27, 1945, General Mac Arthur, who had taken over the government as Military Administrator, turned over the reins of the civil government to President Osmena. In turning over the Commonwealth to Osmena, General Mac Arthur declared: * * * God has in deed blessed our arms! The girded and unleased power of America, supported by our Allies, turned the tide of battle in the Pacific... culminating in the redemption of your soil and the liberation of your people. My country has kept the faith! Osmena, to uched by the simple yet significant event, said: “Let us pledge ourselves and all that is within us to the firm resolve to continue the fight with every ounce of our strength...” THE “LIBERATION” 423 On July 4, Mac Arthur proclaimed the liberation of the en¬ tire Philippines from the enemy. The End of the War.—The Philippines having been liberated from the enemy, Mac Arthur proposed to carry the war right at Japan’s door. Hundreds of B-29’s, the superforts, bombed the mainland of Japan, reducing the latter’s war potential. Important Japanese ports and cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kure were bombed day and night, giving the enemy no respite. On July 26, the Allies, through President Truman and Prime Minister Churchill, issued the Potsdam Proclamation calling upon Japan to surrender unconditionally or face “prompt and utter destruction.” Japan, proud of her strength and prouder still of her samurai spirit, refused to surrender. On August 6, Tokyo time, the United States Air Force unleased the deadly at omic bomb on Hiroshima, demolishing almost one half of the city and killing thousands of in habitants. On August 9, another at omic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. To make things more difficult for the Japanese, Russia declared war against Japan on the same day. Faced with to tal annihilation, Japan uncon¬ ditionally accepted the Allies’ demand for surrender on August 15. On September 2, Japan signed the terms of surrender on board the battleship Missouri at Tokyo Bay. The war was over. * * * * * * V I a'<a? ia, ^' f i / A I 1 \\.« ■ - a A '-‘i ■:* a, a j,. ■. •„ »V» A •) •* ' N / i \" ■ ' Wi: ‘ ■ ■ t:... ' v • *. -, V. m/... ■ ■ ’•> •>' -v • •*: ■...: • • w.

The basic problem, the refore, that confronted the Commonwealth and, later, the Republic, was eco¬ nomic. Buildings, school houses, roads, bridges, livestock, sugar mills, agriculture, and banking in stitutions had to be rehabilit¬ ated or reconstructed. The problem of collaboration also faced the government. There was confusion in the national scene; the wounds of the recent war were as yet unhealed. The United States gave material and financial aid to the Philippines on con¬ dition that the Philippine Constitution should be amended in or der to give the Americans parity rights in the exploitation of the country’s natural resources. Amidst economic, social, and political confusion the Republic of the Philippines was bom to shoulder the responsibilities at tendant to an in dependent existence. Post-War Economic Conditions.—The ravages of war had left their imprint on the economy of the country. The in comes of the people dipped radically and means of livelihood were reduced tremendously. Poverty, resulting from widespread destruction of property, in cluding work animals, was rampant throughout the country. It was estimated that the damage to different in dustries' amounted to about P 582,500,000, while domestic assets sustained a reduction of about P 798,767,595. Various in dustries suffered great losses: rice, P 140,291,000; mining, P 121,210,000; sugar, P 94,590,000; and livestock, P 81,203,000. The losses of other in dustries, such as lumber, abaca, coconut, and fishing, were in considerable compared with the others. Production was almost at a standstill in the early months following the liberation owing to lack of capital to finance the rehabilitation of destroyed or partially destroyed machinery and other equipments. Shipping and railways were out of opera¬ tion resulting in very limited production and. marketing of con¬ sumer goods. The farms lost some 30% of their implements. 427 428 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE while the source of power to operate the farms was only 60% of the pre-war level.

The Philippine Civil Affairs Unit.—Production was practically at a standstill when the Americans hit the beaches of Luzon. Food was extremely scarce. The condition became worse during and immediately after the battle of Manila when the people’s at tention was centered on saving their lives not only from the at rocities of the Japanese but also from American bombs and guns. Owing to this condition, the American army prompt¬ ly created the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU). This agency provided speedy relief for all the people of Manila and the provinces which had been recently liberated from Japanese rule. First or ganized in New Guinea on September 28, 1944, the PCAU took part in the Leyte campaigns. Its purpose was to assist the various military commanders in the civil adminis¬ tration and relief of the areas liberated. Thus clothed with this authority, the PCAU paid the salaries of municipal of ficials and teachers in areas already in the hands of the Americans. The American Government advanced the money necessary to purchase goods for the relief of the suffering people. This money, how¬ ever, was subject to readjustment with the government of the Commonwealth as soon as military conditions permitted. PCAU or ganized food distributing centers in Manila and the provinces. Rice, cracked com, sardines, salmon, and other American canned goods were distributed free to the people. The amount of goods distributed was based on the number of per¬ sons in a family. Because there was not much food to buy, even if one had the money, most of the heads of the families padded the number of persons comprising their families in or der to get more goods. it PCAU also provided employment to laborers who were each paid P 1.00 daily with food and PI.20 with out food. When enough POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 429 money circulated as a result of employments created by the American army, PCAU provided consumer goods to wholesalers at fixed prices. Those who could not afford to buy direct from the wholesalers continued to receive relief goods. In view of hoarding and the consequent rise in the prices of goods, President Osmena issued an Executive Order setting maximum prices for goods sold in liberated areas. Thus, elon- elon rice was pegged at P 0.32 per ganta; wheat flour, P 0.15 per kilo; vegetable lard, P 0.35 per kilo; refined brown sugar, P 0.14 per kilo, dried fish, first class, P 0.80 per kilo; second class, P 0.60; third class, P 0.40; fourth class, P 0.20; two to matoes, P 0.01, and so on, in cluding prices for gabi, bananas, petroleum, shirt, drawers, undershirt, to wel, handkerchief, haircut, etc. The Executive Order, however, was good only on paper, for the prices of com¬ modities in the markets were very much higher than those pro¬ vided for in the law. For example, eggs, which the government pegged at P 0.30 each, were selling at P 0.70 in all public markets; bananas, whose price was set at P 0.01 each, were quoted at from P 0.10 to P 0.25 each. Nevertheless, since there was money in circulation the people purchased whatever was of fered in the markets. There was much grumbling, of course, but the people had no other alternative than to acquiesce to the whims of the profiteers. Reorganization of the Government.—As the raging fires of Manila and the provinces subsided in the wake of the Japanese defeat in the field, President Osmena reorganized the government to make it responsive to the imperative needs of the nation. On March 7, 1945, he signed an Executive Order providing for the restoration of the executive departments of the government as they existed before the war. The Order was, however, dated February 27. A new feature of the reorganization was the creation of the department of in for mation as part of the Depart¬ ment of Public Instruction. On March 8, Osmena swore in the new members of the Cabinet. In a speech following the oath¬ taking, Osmena outlined the principles his government would follow. He said: We hereby affirm our faith in, and adherence to, the principles of freedom and democracy... We shall reestablish in our country a social and political system... in which government of ficials and employees are not the masters of the people but their servants... We stand for the in dividual liberties, guaranteed by our Con- 430 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE stitution, for the right of every man and woman to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We reject the the ory of the existence of chosen or* superior races... We reaffirm our faith in the principle of Philippine-American collaboration... We reiterate our adherence to the Atlantic Charter signed by the United Nations of which we are a member... * * * We stand for a new world free from want and fear, provided with greater safeguards for lasting peace... We are ready to take part, in close association with the United States, in... the or gan¬ ization and preservation of the peace of the world. The Congress Convened.—Most of the important affairs of the government should have been handled by the Filipino of ficials, but Mac Arthur, a man of action and of a military temper, actually made the important decisions for President Osmena. The latter, unassuming and cool under fire, did not want to convoke Congress on the ground that it might fall into the hands of collaborators, whom the American Government suspected of treason. Mac Arthur, however, believed that Osmena was too slow and wanted Congress immediately convoked, for the policy of the American Government was to restore constitutional govern¬ ment in the Philippines as soon as law and or der had been estab¬ lished. On June 9, Osmena called a special session of Congress. Manuel A"

The latter, unassuming and cool under fire, did not want to convoke Congress on the ground that it might fall into the hands of collaborators, whom the American Government suspected of treason. Mac Arthur, however, believed that Osmena was too slow and wanted Congress immediately convoked, for the policy of the American Government was to restore constitutional govern¬ ment in the Philippines as soon as law and or der had been estab¬ lished. On June 9, Osmena called a special session of Congress. Manuel A. Roxas, whose ambition was to be President of the Philippines, immediately spoke for the so-called collaborationists by declaring that all men who were employed during the Japanese occupation were actually loyal to the Commonwealth Govern¬ ment. It was Roxas’ way of winning to his side the powerful members of the Nacionalista Party who worked, willingly or unwillingly, for the enemy. Mac Arthur, it seemed obvious, was behind Roxas’ drive for the presidency, for he considered Roxas the “man of the hour,” the “strong man” who could save the Philippines in a critical period. Osmena, who was faced with the difficult problem of re¬ habilitation and reconstruction, not to say the problem of colla¬ boration, wanted peace within his Nacionalista Party. Conse¬ quently, he of fered Roxas, elected senator immediately before the war, to go to Washington as Philippine Resident Commis¬ sioner. Roxas, however, turned down the of fer, for he had in mind the Presidency of the Philippines. Two days later, on POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 431 May 26, Roxas in structed his men to launch his candidacy. In the face of such political rebellion, Osmena declared that he would step aside to give way to Roxas if the latter wanted to run for the presidency. The way was now paved for the as¬ cendancy of Roxas. Mac Arthur, who believed that it was “im¬ possible to start things with out calling the Philippine Congress to a session,” exerted pressure on Osmena. In July the President called the Congress to a regular session. One of the first things the Congress did was to reward its members with three years’ back pay corresponding to the three years of enemy occupation. The government employees, envy¬ ing the legislators’ “good luck,” in turn demanded for three years’ back pay. They held a demonstration at Malakanyang to compel Osmena to promise them back pay, but the President, more realistic and honest, promised nothing, saying that there was no money with which to pay the government employees. Roxas, however, his eyes cocked to the presidency, promised that if elected he would recommend the passage of a Back Pay Law. The Law, approved in 1948, promised to give three years’ back pay to all pre-war government employees after the end of a ten-year period, that is, in 1958. The Collaboration Issue.—Osmena faced the problem of collaboration with an open mind. But the line of conduct he was to follow with regard to the question was laid down for him by President Roosevelt when, on June 29, 1944, the latter stated that those who collaborated with the enemy should be removed “from authority and in fluence over the political and economic life of the country.” Consequently, when Congress was convened to a special session on August 14, at least two bills were presented providing for the creation of a court to try the so-called collaborators. Osmena, however, realizing that the bills were unsatisfactory, presented an administration measure providing for a court whose judges were not identified with the so-called collaborators. The Roxas faction in Congress maneu¬ vered to have the Osmena bill to ned down. There were heated discussions on the bill. On September 11, American Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes reminded Osmena, in a cablegram, of the late President Roosevelt’s policy regarding collaboration in his statement of June 29, 1944. There was a hint of with¬ drawal of American aid when he said that “I would call at ten¬ tion of your Government to the probable reluctance with which funds may be appropriated for relief, rehabilitation and support 432 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of the Commonwealth Government if it becomes generally be¬ lieved that the Government had failed diligently and firmly to convict and punish those guilty of collaboration.,, It was clear that the American Government wanted Osrnena to deal with the collaborationists firmly. It was thus that the Osrnena bill, with some modifications, was passed. In September 1945, the American agency, the Counter-In¬ telligence Corps (CIC), handed over to the Commonwealth Gov¬ ernment all the detained political prisoners. Some of them, big names in the Philippine political scene before the war, were set free upon the suggestions of both Osrnena and Roxas. Mean¬ while, the People’s Court, which handled all cases of collabora¬ tion, tried the various cases brought before it. Some were found guilty and imprisoned, but the others were not. As the facts of collaboration came to light, the people, who were at first swayed by passion in their judgment of the issue, now slowly realized that the “collaboration” of many of the of ficials in the Laurel Government was in tended to soften the impact of the Japanese military administration. With the publication of Senator Claro M. Recto’s brilliant book, Three Years of Enemy Occupation, in 1946, the cause of those who wanted all collaborators jailed was weakened. When Roxas won the presidency in 1946 he solved the collaboration issue by proclaiming amnesty to all political prisoners. He had no alternative, for he was himself a “colla¬ borator”, having been active in Laurel’s Government. Senator Recto refused to be amnestied, believing in the justice of his cause. He fought his legal battles with the People’s Court and won an acquittal. American Financial Aid.—The general economic situation arising from the ravages of the war led the American Govern¬ ment to survey the actual damage in flicted by the enemy on the Philippines. Consequently, Senator Millard Tydings, co¬ author of the Tydings-Mc Duffie Independence Act, was sent to the Philippines to make the survey.

Tydings arrived in Ma¬ nila on May 23, 1945 and in tended to stay for four weeks. A misunderstanding with Mac Arthur led Tydings to conclude his mission after a few days’ stay. Upon his return to the United States, Tydings recommended that the Philippines be given $100,000,000 for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Moreover, he recommended that the pre-war trade i lations between the Philippines and the United States be continued for a period of from three to five years. Measures were then enacted by the POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 433 American Congress to help put the Philippines on her feet. It voted for $120,000,000 for the rehabilitation of public buildings, roads, and bridges. To put Philippine finance on a sound basis, the American Congress also passed a law providing for $75,000,000 for budgetary purposes and another $25,000,000 for the redemption of guerrilla notes used as currency of the guerrillas during the occupation. On top of this, the American Army surplus, worth one billion dollars but with a sale value of PI 00,- 000,000, was turned over to the Philippine Government. For reconstruction purposes, the United States Reconstruction and Finance Corporation granted a loan of $60,000,000 to the Philippines. The Bell Trade and Rehabilitation Acts.—The proclama¬ tion of Philippine in dependence on July 4, 1946 was a settled matter. There was no opposition from across the Pacific. But the matter of future trade relations was given some thought by American leaders. On September 26, 1945, Congressman C. Jasper Bell of Missouri in troduced a bill providing for free trade relations between the United States and the Philippines for a period o* twenty years. The bill was opposed in some quarters as being prejudicial to the preparation of the Philippines for in dependence. Senator Tydings ^escribed the bill as opposed to in dependence and that its proponents were in fa\\ or of keeping “the Philippines economically” a colony of the United States. Jasper Bell, however, wa& not dismayed. In October, he in¬ troduced another bill providing for an eight-year free trade relations with the United States. After much discussions, the bill was approved. The bill, known as the Bell Trade Relations Act, provided for free-trade relations between the United States and the Phil¬ ippines until 1954, after which goods coming from the United States end from the Philippines would be taxed five per cent tariff in crease every year until the full 100% was reached in 1974. The bad feature of the law was the provision giving “parity’ rights to the Americans, that is to say, *he Americans would have the right to dispose, exploit, develop, and utilize “all agricultural, timber, and mineral lands” of the Philippines, to gether with the operation of public utilities and the exploita¬ tion of the “waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, an^ mineral re¬ sources cf the Philippines.” This particular provision meant that the Filipinos. vould ha\"re to amend the Constitution which provides that only corporations of which the Filipinos owned 434 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE at least 60% could dispose, exploit, develop and utilize the pub¬ lic lands and their mineral resources. To make matters worse for the Filipinos, the American Congress passed the Tydings Rehabilitation Act as a comple¬ ment to the Bell Trade Relations Act. President Truman signed the bill into a law on April 30, 1946. The Rehabilitation Act provided for an outlay of $620,000,000 to be given to those who suffered damage during the war. But a condition was at tached to the payment of war damage: that no amount in excess of $500 would be given unless and until an agreement had been reached by the Presidents of the Philippines and the United States regarding trade relations between the two countries. The effectivity of the Rehabilitation Act was conditioned by the amendment of the Philippine Constitution in such a way as to give “parity” rights to the Americans. It is obvious that the United States would help her most loyal ally only if the Amer¬ icans would be granted the same rights as the Filipinos enjoy in the exploitation of the natural resources of the country. The United States, then, played the role of a man who, having been aided by a friend who lost everything in defense of the for mer, now brashly demanded that he be given the right to live with his friend’s wife in exchange for his financial help. The Election of 1946.- When Mac Arthur returned to the Phil¬ ippines the of ficials of the Laurel Government were for cibly taken by the Japanese. Some of them were taken to Baguio in the wake of the retreating Japanese army, while others were flown to Japan. Manuel A. Roxas, elected senator in the election of November 1941, was one of those taken to Baguio. Mac- Arthur, a friend of Roxas, or dered his men to liberate Roxas.

To create a good impression on the minds of the electorate, Mac Arthur issued a statement clearing Roxas of any taint of collaboration with the enemy.

Nevertheless, he had to give in to Mac Arthur whose reputation was enough to cow him into submission.

Nevertheless, he had to give in to Mac Arthur whose reputation was enough to cow him into submission. POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 435 When finally Congress was convened, Roxas was promptly elected President of the Senate. As head of this powerful body, Roxas harassed Osmena by either sitting on or disapproving President Osmena’s nominations to important positions in the government. The heavy burden of state and his delicate health led Osmena to the conclusion that it was time for him to retire. He made his announcement to his men, saying that if Roxas wanted to be the President he, Osmena, would be graceful enough to give way to the younger Roxas. Roxas himself was not in good health, and this fact led him to believe that now was the time to become President. Osmena’s men wanted him to continue to serve the country and so persuaded him to run for the Presi¬ dency. Thus, the Nacionalista Party was split in two factions: “the Osmena faction and the Roxas faction. On January 4, 1946, Congress met in a special session and set the election on April 23. Roxas began strengthening the machinery of his faction, which was named the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party. Several factors favored Roxas. On the positive side, he was younger, a go-getter, brilliant, an ef¬ fective or ator, and backed up by Mac Arthur, Paul V. Mc Nutt, the American High Commissioner to the Philippines, and Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon, the late President’s wife. Moreover, Roxas had a paramount issue against the Osmena Administra¬ tion, namely, the graft and corruption in the government. On the negative side, Osmena was a passive man who, many peo¬ ple believe, was “too slow” in the face of a national crisis. Moreover, he refused to go out to campaign and satisfied him¬ self with saying that the people knew his forty years of honest and faithful service to the country. The people, of course, knew all this, but they missed the magic of his personality in numerous meetings throughout the country, while, on the other hand, they were transfixed by the fiery or at ory of Roxas who promised to bring heaven to earth. The people, who had had enough of conditions reminiscent of the Japanese occupation, refused to heed the warnings of the pro-Osmena camp that Roxas was a collaborationist and should, the refore, not be elected. They preferred, in stead, beautiful promises of heaven and, conse¬ quently, catapulted Roxas to the presidency. Carried along with Roxas were his running mate, Elpidio Quirino, and a ma¬ jority of the Liberal candidates for senator and representative. With Roxas’ victory, the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party assumed a new color and became the Liberal Party. 436 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Two months after the election, on July 4, 1946, Philippine in dependence was proclaimed and Roxas became the first Pres¬ ident of the Republic. Policies of the Roxas Administration.- Elected amidst ruins and hunger, Roxas, in his in augural address as the last President of the Commonwealth, laid down the bases of his policy: the rebuilding of the *‘economy that was broken and destroyed by war,” the in dustrialization of the country, the encourage¬ ment of Filipinos “to participate in all the operations of our new economy at all its levels”, devotion “to the ideals of an in divisible peace and an in divisible world,” close cooperation with the United States, and the restoration of the “role of law and government as the arbiter of right among the people.” In his in augural address on July 4, 1946, as the first Pres¬ ident of the Republic, Roxas waxed enthusiastically, recalling with pride and with thanks the coming of the Americans in 1898 and urging the people to have absolute faith in the goodness of America. “To do otherwise,” he said, “would be to for eswear all faith in democracy, in our future, and in ourselves.” Thus, the Filipinos should, happen what may, follow the American lead. “Our safest course,” he said eloquently, to the delight of Mac Arthur, Mc Nutt, and other high American of ficials who at¬ tended the in dependence ceremonies, “Our safest course and I believe it true for the rest of the world as well, is in the glisten¬ ing wake of America whose sure advance with mighty prow breaks for smaller craft the waves of fear.” Roxas, of course, was merely rhetorical, for he did not know that it is not always safe to follow the course of the “glistening wake of America” or of any other nation when the wake leads to national economic perdition. Guerrilla Amnesty.—Not only the collaboration issue but also the guerrilla problem rocked the country immediately after liberation. The so-called guerrilla problem consisted in the abuses allegedly committed by many guerrillas during the enemy occu¬ pation. When the courts of justice had been re-established, many criminal complaints were filed against the guerrillas who were charged with murder, rape, kidnapping, and robbery during the three years of Japanese occupation. The court dockets were clogged with these cases, and the guerrillas naturally looked up to Roxas as their savior. On September 7, 1946, Roxas pro¬ claimed a general amnesty of those guerrillas who killed and POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 437 murdered in pursuance of the resistance movement. However, those who kidnapped, murdered, and otherwise confiscated property not in pursuance of the objectives of the guerri Pa movement were not in cluded in the amnesty. “It is not only unjust,” Roxas said in his message to Congress explaining his amnesty proclamation, “but most ungrateful on the part of our Republic to allow these brave and patriotic men to be subjected to the in dignity of a criminal prosecution for acts which they committed in their heroic endeavors to resist the enemy and to help in winning the war"

The Treaty of General Relations.—Immediately after the in dependence ceremonies, the Philippines, now a Republic, and the United States entered into a treaty of general relations. In accordance with this treaty, the United States with drew and surrendered “all rights of possession, supervision, jurisdiction, control or sovereignty” over the Philippines, except such bases as the United States would need for the mutual protection of the United States and the Philippines. Pending the establish¬ ment of Philippine diplomatic service abroad, the United States would represent the in terests of the Philippines “in countries where there is no Philippine representation.” On the other hand, the Philippines agreed to assume all debts of the cities, munici¬ palities, provinces, and in strumentalities deemed valid and sub¬ sisting on July 4, 1946. Moreover, the Philippines agreed to assume all obligations the United States had assumed after the conclusion of the Treaty of Paris between the United States and Spain, December 10,1898. The treaty, then, the first to be concluded by the Republic of the Philippines, was entered into by the United States in or der to recognize Philippine in dependence of ficially. The Plebiscite of 1947.—The election of 1946 resulted not only in the return to* power of the pre-war lords of Philippine economy, but also, as a reaction against such a comeback, in the election of six Democratic Alliance men, headed by Luis Taruc of Pampanga, to Congress. These Congressmen-elect, 438 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE who won by virtue of the solid support of the peasant votes of their districts, were against collaborationists in the government and, more so, against giving the Americans parity rights in the exploitation of Philippine natural resources. To give parity rights to the Americans, the Philippine Con¬ stitution had to be amended. The presence of Taruc and other elected Congressmen belonging to the Democratic Alliance, a party composed of non-collaborators, in tellectuals, and peasants, posed a danger to the passage in Congress of a law amending the Constitution in or der to give parity rights to the Americans. With these six and other Congressmen and Senators against parity rights President Roxas and his men might not get the necessary three-fourths majority to amend the Constitution. Upon the in stigation of Roxas, Congress passed a resolution unseating Taruc and his Democratic Alliance colleagues from Congress. The ostensible ground for expulsion was the alleged electoral frauds and terrorism committed by the Hukbalahaps in Central Luzon which resulted in the election of six candidates of the Democratic Alliance and one Nacionalista. With the expulsion of Taruc and his companions, the way was paved for the Congress resolution agreeing to amend the Constitution. On March 11, 1947, Congress submitted to the people the following draft amending the Constitution:... the disposition, exploitation, development, and utilization of all agricultural, timber, and mineral lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other natural resources of the Philippines, and the operation of public utilities, shall, if open to any person, be open to citizens of the United States and to all forms of business enterprises owned or controlled, directly or in¬ directly, by citizens of the United States... Roxas and his men went to the people to explain the “bless¬ ings” of American exploitation of the natural resources of the country and painted a dream picture of wealth, contentment, peace, and prosperity in the wake of such exploitation. In the same speech, delivered at Plaza Miranda on March 17, 1947, Roxas said: We have to day our one big chance to convert our native land into an ideal of democracy. Our one chance is to grow and in¬ dustrialize to reach the first rank of the nations of the world. We have this chance because of the heroism we displayed in the war; we have this chance because we have demonstrated by deed our POST-WAR PROBLEMS AND THE REPUBLIC 439 love for freedom. We have earned the gratitude of mankind. We can and will show to morrow that we deserve that gratitude by plunging courageously ahead in the great tasks we face. Opponents of the parity amendment, led by Claro M. Recto and Jose P. Laurel, fought its approval by the people. They delivered speeches assailing the wisdom of amending the Con¬ stitution, the sacred document of the land, in or der to give the Americans equal rights with the Filipinos in the exploitation of the natural resources of the country.

Opponents of the parity amendment, led by Claro M. Recto and Jose P. Laurel, fought its approval by the people.

Death Came for Roxas.—Roxas was sincere when he out¬ lined his program of rehabilitation and reconstruction. There was, in fact, too much sincerity in him that he would go to any length to be the architect of the Philippines’ rise to a prosperous status. The basis of that material prosperity for which he and his countrymen were laboring was close friendship with the United States no matter what happened. He was that naive. The world of 1948 was in turmoil. The Berlin Crisis was coming to a head with the Soviet Union creating trouble spots all over Europe in or der to weaken the democracies. In Asia, Chiang Kai-shek was on the verge of collapse and the communist army of Chu Teh was trampling upon the Nationalist Chinese’s opposition with contemptuous disregard for human life. The United States, the spearhead of the democracies, was looking in all directions for allies. What more propitious moment than the present to gauge Roxas’ loyalty to the United States? So, in March 1948, the military authorities of Clark Air Base in vited Roxas to make a public statement on the loyalty of the Philippines to the United States. Roxas accepted the in¬ vitation and delivered a major speech at the Kelly Theater on April 15, 1948. Waxing enthusiastically, he said: “But if war should come, if God in His Supreme Wisdom shall will it that the scourge 440 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of war again visit the bewildered peoples of this earth, I am certain of one thing... and it is this, that in case of a new war waged by the aggressor against the for ces of freedom, and liberty, the Americans and the Filipinos will be found on the same side and American and Filipino soldiers will again fight side by side in the same trenches or in the air in defense of justice, of free¬ dom, and the other principles which we both love and cherish.” Roxas’ loyalty speech was received with tremendous ovation. He was, however, not feeling well and by evening he was turn¬ ing for the worse. At 9:30, while an American army of ficer was passing by the foot of the President’s bed, he noticed that Roxas made a sudden gasp. In a few minutes, President Roxas was dead. Two days later, Vice-President Elpidio Quirino took his oath of of fice as President of the Philippines. Quirino’s Administration.—Quirino was suffering from high blood pressure and was “taking it easy” in a boat cruising the Visayan waters when he received the news of Roxas’ unexpected death. Upon assuming of fice, Quirino, who in herited the grave problems of the State, announced that his program of government would consist in restoring the faith and confidence of the people in the government and in the restoration of peace and or der. The first part of the program was based on the realization that the people had lost their confidence in the government owing to the rampant graft and corruption of the Liberal Party’s hench¬ men and favorites. The second part was based on the pathetic lack of peace and or der not only in the cities, but also in the countryside. The Hukbalahaps of Taruc had gone underground and refused to surrender their arms. The Military Police and Civilian Guards, on the other hand, were on a rampage kidnapping and killing suspected persons with out due process of law. On top of this, production was slow and unemployment was in creas¬ ing with unheard of proportions. / Quirino surveyed the field with a critical eye and summed up his program of government, as follows: government reorgan¬ ization to achieve efficiency at all levels of the bureaucracy, immediate in creased production to give employment to thousands of idle laborers, vigorous and honest enforcement of tax laws, the preservation of the national in tegrity, and continued friendly relations with the countries of the world. 24 / THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT The Hukbalahap Movement has its deep roots in the Spanish encomienda system which developed into a system of exploitation. The numerous abuses, in justices, and cruelties perpetrated by the encomenderos upon the Filipino peasants led to uprisings that failed because of lack of unity and leadership. Nevertheless, the seeds of revolt were planted in the minds of tne peasants. In the nineteenth century, Filipino landlordism rose and, with it, more abuses. The agrarian problem, far from being solved, became acute. It was not until the coming- of the Americans that certain reforms were in itiated to lessen the tension between tenants and landlords. But the reforms were palliative in nature and did not actually solve the problem. With political conscious¬ ness, the peasants were united by educated but poor leaders. The most potent of these peasant or ganizations was the Huk¬ balahap, which began as a resistance or ganization against the Japanese and ended as a movement against the government. Spanish Origins.—-There is no record of any agrarian unrest in pre-Spanish times; the unrest, in so far as records are concerned, dates from the Spanish period when the encomienda was estab¬ lished about 1570. High taxes, coupled with unspeakable abuses connected the rewith, led to widespread discontent among the people. Theoretically, the encomienda was an excellent in sti¬ tution designed to protect the people from exploitation and to educate them in the Christian faith. Actually, however, it was used as a tool of exploitation by the rapacious encomenderos. The people were dispossessed of the land upon which they staked their very lives. Such a feudal setup led to the widening of the gap between the ruling class and the people"

Actually, however, it was used as a tool of exploitation by the rapacious encomenderos. The people were dispossessed of the land upon which they staked their very lives. Such a feudal setup led to the widening of the gap between the ruling class and the people. To make their rule more effective in so far as economic exploitation was concerned, the Spanish of ficials and friars bestowed little favors on the descendants of the Filipino rajahs and nobles by making the latter a sort of middlemen between the rulers and the ruled. The result was more and more exploitation of the poorer class by both the Spaniards and their Filipino stooges. At the same 441 442 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE time, the friar estate, legally and illegally acquired, grew to such an extent as to swallow up the parcels of land belonging either to the public domain or to the small planters who were too ignorant to secure legal rights over their property. The abolition of the encomienda late in the seventeenth century did not mend matters. On the contrary, the friars ex¬ panded their estates with the Filipinos continuing as tenants and agricultural workers. A small number of Filipino tenants, however, turned lessees and became economically well off. In the nineteenth century, they constituted the Filipino landed aristocracy. But while an exceedingly small number of Filipinos became prosperous, the great bulk of the people became serfs. The peasants remained illiterate and were burdened with heavy taxes and other unjust and in iquitous impositions which made life unbearable for them. The upshot was agrarian unrest, which exploded into uprisings and revolts through out the country. These uprisings were suppressed ruthlessly, for the government was in unholy alliance with the Spanish landlords. The life of the peasant during the Spanish period was charac¬ terized by absolute penury and degradation. The customary division of the crops was 50-50, with the peasants furnishing the to ols and work animals. Under the setup the peasant earned no more than twenty pesos a year. On top of this, he was in¬ variably the victim of his landlord’s rapacity: he was compelled to borrow money from his landlord at an exorbitant in terest. The result was that the peasant became heavily in debted to the landlord. This in debtedness was in herited by the peasant’s children and children’s children, the reby pinning them down, in cluding the unborn generation, to the land with out any hope of release from servitude. This in humanity to man was com¬ pounded by making the peasant work for the landlord with out pay. The peasant’s chickens, too, were for the landlord. His children were the servants of the landlord, who never had the heart to pay them a single centavo. Under such conditions, the peasant had no other recourse than to gamble. His fatalism made him take a chance a cock- fighting to in crease his in come. In this, as in the other forms of gambling, only the owner of the cockpit benefited from the soltadas or fights, because a certain percentage of the bets was THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 443 taken by the cockpit owner. Losses in the cockfights meant more borrowing from the landlord. On top of this, the peasant, ignorant, fanatical, and encouraged in his fanaticism by the friars, had to pawn whatever little possessions he had in or der to participate in the annual fiesta. Fiestas were encouraged by the friars, for such occasions gave them more money in the form of payments for masses, candles, scapularies, and other religious appurtenances. The net result was the in creased de¬ pendence of the peasant on his landlord, continued loss of self- respect and in come, and an abject life. Agrarian Unrest under the Americans.” The factors that helped shape the “filibustero” ment ality of the second half of the nineteenth century arose out of the conditions brought about by the economic structure of the Spanish colonial sys¬ tem. Of these factors, the most important was economic: the cruelties, thievery, and in justices of the Spanish of ficials and friars were perpetrated in or der to amass wealth and, with it, power. Having tasted wealth and power, they tried their best to maintain the status quo, on the one hand, and to subvert any movement for reforms, on the other. In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the Filipino middle class rose to prominence and in itiated the reform movement. Such a move¬ ment necessarily resulted in a social tension, for the Spanish ruling class, highly suspicious of any movement that would cur¬ tail their vested in terests, refused to give in to the demands of the Filipino reformist group. The tension snapped when, in 1896, the masses, led by Andres Bonifacio, took to the field against the Spanish oppressors. The Revolution of 1896 was a revolt of the masses, for the latter bore the brunt of the armed conflict and who, in their desire to change the status quo, in itiated it in the first place, and fought to the last, in the second place. Socially and economically, however, the Revolution was a failure. While it dislodged the Spanish ruling class and drove Spain’s prestige to the precipice, the Filipino upper class rush¬ ed into the vacuum created by the disappearance of the Spanish rulers. The peasants continued to play their role of the exploited after the Revolution and through the American period. The Americans, it is true, somewhat softened the hard core of the system of exploitation, but the basic conditions remained: poverty, ignorance, tendency to gambling, lack of self-respect, and religious fanaticism"

The Americans could very well have solved the agrarian problem at the turn of the century, but they 444 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE did not, for the men fhey placed at the helm of the government were, in general, of the cacique class, the class which learned from and in herited the Spanish colonial’s technique of mass exploitation. Usury, which thrived during the Spanish regime, continued „o exist under the American rule. The landlords improved upon the techniques of their for mer Spanish masters and in vented ways of circumventing the Anti-Usury Law. Several techniques were employed to exploit the peasant. The most notorious was the takipan which consisted in paying 100% in terest. The talin- duwa consisted m the peasant paying 50% in terest on a loan; the takalanan consisted in the peasant paying what he borrowed in kind, say, palay. If a peasant borrowed, say, fifty pesos and the cost of a cavan of palay at the time the loan was made was two pesos, he had to pay his landlord twenty-five cavans at the time of harvest even if the cost of the palay had risen to five pesos per cavan. If the price per cavan dropped, the or iginal two pesos per cavan was put into effect. In either case, the peasant was the loser. In the pasunod, the peasant was for ced to borrow from his landlord whether he liked it or not. The same technique was employed as in the takalanan. In the baligtaran, the palay was converted into money at, say, one peso per cavan at the time the loan was made. At harvest time, the value of the palay was in creased or decreased so as to favor the landlord. Such practices added to the misery of the peasant. The realization of their lowly condition and the failure of the government to stop the caciques from their nefarious practices led to uprisings in Luzon in 1931 and in 1935. J. Ralston Hayden, for mer Acting Governor General of the Philippines and a close student of Philippine affairs, said: I doubt, however, if you could find ten Americans in the Islands who do not believe that the poor peasants who rose against constituted authority at Tayug (Pangasinan) were rebelling chiefly against “caciquism”, agrarian oppression, and Constabulary abuses. One Filipino newspaper strongly expressed this view, and Tomas Confesor, the ever outspoken Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, told his people that this was the case, adding that dangerous discontent based upon oppression and in justice existed over large areas of the plain of Central Luzon. The Rise of Socialism and Communism.--Any movement THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 445 that has its roots in the social and economic in equalities, par¬ ticularly in oppression and fraudulent practices on the part of those in power, always finds a leader or misleader. The freedoms that the United States brought to the Philippines led to a political consciousness which seeped through the minds of the peasants and workers. Labor and peasart leaders appeared and united the unwieldy peasants and laborers into unions. The awakening of the exploited class came during the first decade of American rule when labor and peasant unions sprouted overnight. In this awakening, Tagalog novels played a significant part. Lope K. Santos’ Banaag at Sikat (Rays and Sunrise), first published serially in the nationalistic Muling Pagsilang and, in 1906, published in book form, brought the socialist tenets before the view of the laborers and the peasants. This was followed later oy Faustino Aguilar’s Busabos ng Palad (Slave of Fate, 1907) and Nangalunod sa Katihan (Drowned in the Beach, 1911) which described the poor peasants and their rapacious landlords. In 1936 Servando de los Angeles, in the wake of labor strikes and the peasant move¬ ment, published his novel Ang Hiding Tirnawu (The Last Serf) which was obviously an anti-landlord work. These various in fluences—the freedoms, political conscious¬ ness, and the role of the socialistic novels — led to a more aggressive movement of the lower class. In 1922, the peasants banded the mselves into the Confederation ue Aparceros y Obreros Agricolas de Filipinos (Philippine Confederation of Tenants and Agricultural Workers), under the leadership of Jacinto Manahan. Two years later, it was re-named Katipunang Pambansa ng mga Magbubukid sa Pilipinas (National Peasants’ Union of the Philippines). This union and the Philippine Labor Congress became the most powerful weapons of the lower class in their fight for reforms beneficial to their class. In 1928, representatives of the Philippine Labor Congress at tended a trade conference in Canton, China, which was spon¬ sored by the communists. Upon their return, they founded the Labor Party. In the same year, the Philippine Labor Congress affiliated itself with the Red International (Organization) of Labor Unions, the reby making the PLC a communist union. The following year, 1929, the conservative and the communist leaders of the PLC disagreed on matters of policy, and Crisanto Evangelista, a communist, founded his Katipunan ng mga Anak- pawis ng Pilipinas (Congress of Philippine Workingmen), while the other leaders, Ruperto S.

At first the communists were allowed to work unhampered, but in 1932 the Supreme Court declared the Communist Party an illegal as¬ sociation. Though outlawed, the j Communist Party worked se¬ cretly among the peasants and laborers, particularly of Central Luzon. In 1929, Pedro Abad Santos, a wealthy and cultured land¬ lord of Pampanga, founded the Socialist Party. The following year, he founded the Aguman Ding Maldang Talapagobra (Workers’ and Peasants’ Union) or, more simply, AMT. Both the Socialist Party and the AMT were aspects of the same move¬ ment, whose purpose was to secure better conditions and in¬ creased pay for the workers and peasants. The Socialist Party acted as the political arm of the Union. The Socialist Party did not become widespread and popular until after 1932. It was not, however, outlawed, for it did not advocate the overthrow of the existing government. But while the Communist Party members, having been outlawed, remained in the underground, the Socialists worked openly for important reforms. In 1938, when the Communist leaders who were im¬ prisoned in 1932 were pardoned, the two parties — the Commnist and the Socialist — merged. Thus, the peasants and workers of Central Luzon, while not actually communists, were never¬ the less members of an or ganization whose leaders were avowed communists. This affiliation of the peasants and workers of Central Luzon with a communist or ganization made them the most politically sophisticated working class in the Philippines. The Founding of the Hukbalahap.- The socialist-communist or ientation of the Central Luzon peasants led to a more militant peasant and labor movement. The years immediately preceding the outbreak of the war in the Pacific may be described as critical, for it was during that period that numerous strikes were recorded. It was also the same period that saw the murder of the millionaire THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 447 hacendero of Pampanga, Jos 6 de Leon, Sr., a bloody affair that resulted from workers’ discontent. Then war came to the Philippines on December 8, 1941. The retreat of the USAFFE to Bataan and the eventual collapse of Filipino-American arms was followed by a short period of confusion on the municipal level. Instinctively, the peasants of Pampanga reacted sharply by for ming home guards for their protection and security. The realities of war imposed a certain degree of discipline on the peasants. The necessity for a unified movement that would, on the one hand, keep the morale of the people at the highest level and, on the other, face the Japanese enemy, led to a meeting of peasant leaders early in February 1942. The meeting, held at the barrio of Bakwit, Cabiao, Nueva Ecija, was at tended by Luis Taruc, Juan Feleo, Casto Alejandrino, Matelo del Castillo, F. Sampanga, Jose de Leon, Lino Dizon, Euse¬ bio Aquino and Mariano Franco. The conferees decided upon “united front” tactics, that is to say, the winning over to their movement of the moderate landlords and the middle class, with the peasants and workers leading and directing the movement. “Anti-Japanese Above All” became the battlecry of the peasant underground movement. The peasant or ganizations were then dissolved in or der to carry out their main policy, namely, to work for a free and democratic Philippines. To carry out this policy, the peasant leaders adopted a three- point plaftform: economic, political, and military. The economic phase of the peasant underground struggle consisted in the develop¬ ment of -all means of providing the people with sustenance and at the same to sabotage Japanese efforts to “loot the country.” The political phase consisted in discrediting the “puppet regime” and in destroying its in fluence. The military aim was to harass the Japanese. Immediately the reafter, the peasants began collect¬ ing all sorts of arms in preparation for a vast resistance movement. With the policies and principles laid down, the peasant leaders met at a clearing in the for est that joined the provinces of Tarlac, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija, on March 29, 1942. A table stood in the clearing and before it were gathered all units of the peasant resistance movement. For one week the leaders discussed common problems. When the name for the vast or ganization came up for discussion, the men unanimously agreed to call it Hukbo ng Bay an Laban sa Hapdn or HUKBALAHAP, for short. There were speeches, all directed against the Japanese and the 448 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Filipino “collaborators” in the government. After the meeting, a Military Committee was for med, with the following as members: Tame, Banal (Bernardo Poblete), Casto Alejandrino, and Felipa Culala (Dayang-Payang), an Amazon whose unit had recently killed several Japanese soldiers. Tame was chosen chairman of the committee, with Alejandrino as second in command. Thus the birth of the Hukbalahap. The Hukbalahap Sovereignty.--The high command of the Hukbalahap imposed an iron discipline on all its members. There was no excuse for deviation from the rigidity of the mles and regulations that made the movement the most disciplined and powerful in the country, during the enemy occupation. That this discipline was real can be gauged from the execution of Dayang- Dayang (Felipa Culala) by her own men when it appealed that she was endangering the movement by her deviation from the rules of the or ganization.

Among them were non-members who were suspected of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The unity and the discipline of the men and women under the in fluence of the Hukbalahap made Central Luzon and a few other provinces outside the region a Huk terri¬ tory. The to wns and the municipal government were in the hands of the Huks who saw to it that peace and or der reigned their respective areas. When war broke out and the Japanese occupied the coun¬ try, the landlords and their families evacuated to Manila. The peasants took over the land of the absentee landlords. This was the beginning of a new era for them: they had freedom and there was plenty of food. Many of the landlords, who had been accustomed to pushing the peasants around and to exploiting them, refused to return to their provinces for fear of being liqui¬ dated by the Huks. Such a situation naturally led to secret ill feeling to ward the Huks, while the latter, on the other hand, felt that their landlords had it coming to them and deserved their fate. This mutual feeling of hatred, as will be seen later, exploded into armed skirmishes which were bloody enough to be narrated in detail. One who had lived in Central Luzon during the enemy oc¬ cupation cannot fail to observe the effectiveness of the Huk resistance movement. Huk “squadrons,” each of which being THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 449 the equivalent of half a battalion, fought hit-and-run battles with the Japanese and killed hundreds of them. So effective was the Huk resistance movement that the Japanese feared them more than they did the other guerrilla units. Thus the Central Plains became a Huk preserve, and while outwardly the Japanese were in command, actually the area recognized Huk sovereignty. Liberation and Imprisonment.—The American landing in Lingayen in January 1945 was opportune, for the guerrillas had already cleared out the Japanese obstacles. The Huks, as the most potent guerrilla outfit, had the straggling Japanese in flight. In mid-January they liberated much of Tarlac, and on the 20 th they assaulted and captured the capital of the prov¬ ince. They hoisted the Filipino and American flags and waited for the arrival of the first American contingents. Meanwhile, some squadrons at tacked the to wns of Pampanga, in cluding San Fernando, and immediately placed them under their ad ministration. Municipal government immediately functioned under Huk auspices, and on January 28, 1945 Casto Alejandrino was “elected” provisional governor of Pampanga. In Nueva Ecija, Juan Feleo was “elected” governor. When the American units turned to Kabanatuan to liberate the Americans concen¬ trated there they found the Huks ahead of them and had already secured the town for them. When, on February 5, the Americans entered Manila in force they promptly disarmed the Huk squadrons that had entered the city ahead of them. The Huks refused to be disarmed and left for Painpanga. They were, however, halted by American MP’s beyond the city limits and for cibly disarmed. Successively, the Huks in Obando and Maykaway an, Bulakan, were also dis¬ armed tor no reason at all. Further in dignity was heaped upon the Huks when Squadron 77, while passing through Malolos on their way to Pampanga, was waylaid by the men under Colonel Adonais Maclang of Malolos, Bulakan, seized, thrown into jail, and shot to death with the knowledge of the American MP’s. Together with the unlisted men who had joined the Squadron earlier there were probably 160 men in all, of whom only thirty lived to tell the grim story. Maclang was later appointed mayor of Malolos. Almost simultaneously, the Americans, fo no apparent reasons, arrested Huk leader “Linda Bie” (Silvestre Liwanag) who had, wit L his Squadrons, helped the Americans in the cap¬ ture of the Floridablanca airfields. His men were disarmed, 450 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and when he was or dered to surrender his revolver, he cried. He refused to surrender his weapon, but one of his men did it for him. “Linda’5 and his men were told that the USAFFE guerrillas, whom the Huks described as tulisaffe,1 had accused them of all kinds of crimes. They were then lodged in the San Fernando jail. They escaped, however, the following day and immediately reported the matter to Taruc. Meanwhile, the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) of the American Army proceeded to remove all municipal of ficials elected by the Huks and replaced them with USAFFE guerrillas, who were the keen rivals of the Huks. There followed a series of arrests and of disarming of the Huks; they were imprisoned by the American Counter-Jntelligence Corps (CIC). An American Air Corps Colonel, Gwen G. Atkinson, who was saved by the Huks and treated kind¬ ly, remonstrated and went to Mac Arthur to defend his bene¬ factors. “I don’t care even if they are communists,” he said. “I saw how they treated American flyers and I saw how the people followed them.” But he was ignored, and the mass arrest of the Huks continued. The Arrest of Taruc.—-The mass arrest of the Huks reached its peak on February 22, 1945, when the CIC arrested the mem¬ bers of the Huk General Headquarters and jailed them in San Fernando, Pampanga. One of those arrested was Luis Taruc. There was, naturally, bitterness among the peasants, for no for mal charges were preferred against the Huk leaders. On March 8, the Americans released Taruc and another leader; the rest, however, were taken to Muntinglupa. A month later, on April 8, Taruc and his companion, GY (Casto Alejandrino), were re¬ arrested and jailed. They were transferred to Calasiao two days later, then to Bilibid in Manila and, finally, to Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Here Taruc mixed with the high of ficials of Laurel’s government who were branded collaborators by the CIC and jailed"

It is significant to note that neither Mac Arthur nor the rival guerrilla units were able to file charges of crimes against Taruc hnd his men. The Huks accused the USAFFE guerrillas of poisoning the minds of the Americans against them and of actually in triguing to have them liquidated by the Americans. More significantly, Taruc accused the landlords of'having in sti¬ gated the move against the Huks in or der to w *ak vengeance on them, and primarily to disorganize the Huk movement for their (landlords’) benefit. Whatever the truth or untruth of the 1 A portmanteau word coming from tulisan — bandit — and USAFFE. 451 t THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT accusations, the fact remains that the Huks, who had fought in the underground, now appeared to be persecuted by the very ally that they expected to help them. This fact is crucial in assessing the Huk movement, for such arrests and imprisonment — done rightly or wrongly — led the Huks to suspect that there was a concerted move to liquidate them and to force them into a way of life under the aegis of the landlords. The imprisonment of Taruc gave rise to a wave of discontent among the peasants and the liberal in tellectuals. On September 23, 1945, some 50,000 peasants and workers marched to Malakanyang and demanded the release of Taruc and his companions. Two days later, GY was released. Taruc was released on September 30. Roxas and the Huks.“When it became evident that Manuel Roxas, whom the Huks accused of having been a collaborator, would run for the presidency the Huks and the Democratic Al¬ liance, a new party composed of in tellectuals, workers, and pea¬ sants, studied the situation and its implications and decided to throw their support behind President Osmena. Roxas, in his at tempt to assure himself of the presidency and knowing the voting potential of the Huks, wooed Taruc and promised him almost everything if Taruc and the Huks would side with him ' in the coming political struggle. “I am more radical than you are, you know,” Roxas was reported to have told Taruc in a desperate at tempt to win over the Huks to his side. Taruc, however, refused to truckle to Roxas, who was reported to be the candidate of the wealthiest men of the country. That was the beginning of Roxas’ hostility to the Huks. He raved against them, he accused them of lawlessness and of being communists. When Roxas finally won the presidency, he in stituted a campaign against the Huks. The Huks, however, succeeded in electing Taruc and other members of the Democratic Alliance to Congress. As months rolled on, the Pilipino MP’s and civilian guards hired by the wealthy landlords of Central Luzon to protect them and to fight the Huks, made a series of raids on the Huk bastions. The result was successive skirmishes in which the civilians, Huks or non-Huks, were the victims. Killings, perpetrated by both sides, became daily occurrences. As a result, the countryside became a sort of no-man’s land. The land was left uncultivated and hundred of families evacuated to safer places. In the wake of these punitive expeditions, the Huks fought back with ferocity. The MP’s for their part in discriminately shot and machinegunned men and women suspected of being Huks. The most notorious 452 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of MP abuses was the Masico Affair in Laguna, in which a group of old and young men and women were machinegunned with out any warning or in vestigation. It appeared later on that the murdered men and women were not dissidents, but in nocent, peaceful citizens. The same wanton disregard for civil rights was exhibited by the MP’s in Maliwalu, Bacolor, Pampanga. A group of men and women was holding a party at night when they were fired upon and killed by the MP’s. Yet there is no evidence that the criminals in MP uniform were punished for their crimes. No wonder, then, that the Huks refused to come to terms with the government but continued, in stead to defy duly constituted authorities. Significant, too, was Roxas’ act in masterminding the un¬ seating of Tame and the other members of the Democratic Al¬ liance who had been elected to Congress. Tame and his com¬ panions were charged with poll frauds in Pampanga and Nueva Ecija. Although the charge of fraud was not conclusive, Tame and his companions were unseated. The parity amendment was then pushed through Congress. Tame, for his part, returned to his people anu led them in the struggle against what he termed in justices committed against the peasants. The Pacification Campaign—Tame and other peasant lead¬ ers, in their desire to make the countryside safe, cooperated with President Roxas in the campaign of pacification. Tame, Juan Feleo, and Mateo del Castillo went from barrio to barrio to explain to their followers the importance of peace and or der in national rehabilitation and reconstmction. It was during this pacification campaign that Tame and Del Castillo received an in telligence report that they would be liquidated by their enemies, among whom were allegedly high government of ficials. The two leaders, in stead of proceeding to their destinations, hid and waited for results. On August 24, 1946, Juan Feleo, the peasant leader of Nueva Ecija, who did not receive the warning on time, while in the company of MP’s who w^re supposed to proiect him in his pacification campaign, was kidnapped right under the very noses of his MP guards and killed. The kidnapping and murder of Feleo, followed by the killing of labor leader Jose Joven, led Tame and his men to believe that the Roxas admi¬ nistration, backed up by wealthy men and landlords, was bent on liquidating the movement of the masses"

On August 29, he wrote a stinging, letter to Roxas practically accusing the latter of in stigating the campaigns against the peaceful Huks. Roxas THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 453 anwered by accusing the Huks of lawlessness.

It was also believed that the purpose in each in stance was to deprive the peasants of leadership in or der to make it easy for the government to deal with them. Outlawing of the Huks.—The sharp and constant fighting between the Huks on one hand, and the MP’s and civilian guards, on the other, wrought havoc on the agricultural economy of Central Luzon. The people, placed in the cross-fire of two con¬ tending for ces, lived in fear and hunger. Seasonal harvests de¬ creased tremendously, resulting in the spiraling of the prices of commodities. For two years, the Roxas Administration tried its best to quell the Huk dissidence to no avail. It seemed that the people were behind the Huks and were prepared to give aid and comfort to their leaders. One MP report would say that Taruc was within the clutches of the government for ces; the fol¬ lowing day the newspaper reports would say that Taruc was no¬ where to be found. Tens of millions of pesos were spent to hunt down Taruc, but the millions and the MP’s to gether failed to track down even the shadow of the peasant leader. Desperate because the condition of peace and or der was giving his administration a bad reputation, what with the rampant graft and corruption, President Roxas issued a proclamation on March 6, 1948, declaring the Hukbalahap and the Pambansang Kaisahan ng mga Magbubukid, which was reorganized after the war by Mateo del Castillo, as “illegal associations or ganized and maintained to commit acts of sedition and other crimes for the purpose of overthrowing our present Government under the Constitution.” Following this declaration, he or dered the arrest of all members of the two outlawed or ganizations. Roxas’ declaration, though not having any force of law, was nevertheless a clear-cut statement of national policy. Henceforth, anybody having any connection with the Huks was considered an enemy of the government and, the refore, liable to be arrested and imprisoned. The proclamation may have been issued in good faith, but its effect on many people was depressing. Indiscrimi¬ nate arrests and killings were made in the name of peace and or der 454 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE and the democratic way of life. In Manila, the MP’s and the civilian guards became the laughing stock of the in tellectuals and the masses. The 'Amnesty Proclamation.—Roxas, whom the Huks labeled as the willing tool of American and Filipino vested in terests, died a+ Clark Field, an American territory, in April 1948. The first task of Elpidio Quirino as successor of Roxas was, as he stated, the establishment of peace and or der so that his admin¬ istration could proceed with economic mobilization and the re¬ storation of the people’s faith and confidence in the government. Quirino knew that the people had lost their faith and confidence in the government not only because of the rampant graft and corruption, but because of the loss of civil liberties in many parts of the country. As a first step to ward the realization of the first objective, Quirino sent his brother, for mer Judge An¬ to nio Quirino, to the field to contact Taruc in or der to know what the Huks wanted. Through the representatives of the Manila Chronicle, I. P. Soliongco and a photographer, the meeting with Taruc and his men was arranged. Judge Quirino and I. P. Soliongco met Taruc on June 6 at a barrio between the to wns of San Miguel and Baliwag, Bulakan. The negotiations were kept strictly secret, for there were for ces, as Judge/ Quirino later on admitted in a letter to Taruc, that did not want any understanding with the Huks. On June 21, Taruc flew to Manila. On the same day, in the presence of Taruc at Malakanyang, President Quirino issued a proclamation granting amnesty to all leaders and members of the Hukbalahap and the PKM. Amnesty was absolute and covered crimes of rebellion, sedition, illegal association, assault, resistance and disobedience to persons in authority. On the other hand, the Huks agreed to present their arms to the duly constituted a\\*thority within a period of fifty days following the grant of amnesty.

At the end of the fifty-day period, a to tal of 3,820 Huks had already registered. Of this number, 3,788 were with out arms. On August 14, the eve of the fifty-day period within which the Huks could register with their arms, Tame left Manila for an undisclosed place in Central Luzon ostensibly on a “mission of peace and to confer with his leaders over the eleventh hour registration.” Three hours after the fifty-day period, the first clash between the 507 th MP Company and a band of fifty Huks occurred at a barrio of Kabanatuan. Hostilities between the MP’s and the Huks were resumed and the peace of Central Luzon was again disturbed. Cause of the Failure of Amnesty.—From his headquarters “somewhere in Central Luzon” Tame accused the Quirino Ad¬ ministration of bad faith and of failing to implement the “secret agreement” with Judge Quirino. The latter, however, in an open letter to Tame, denied any such “secret agreement” was talked about between him and Tame. Judge Quirino promised to make public the details of his negotiations with Tame, to gether with pertinent documents relating to the agreement which led to Tame’s “triumphal march” into Manila... The “secret agree¬ ment,” according to Tame, consisted in (1) scrapping of the Bell Trade Act; (2) no resumption of trade with Japan; (3) division of large estates for distribution to the tenants; (4) release of all Huk prisoners; (5) in dustria Uzation; and (6) no military bases agreement with the United States. Judge Quirino denied these items were ever discussed during his long negotiations with Tame. When, after several weeks, Judge Quirino failed to make good his promise, Tame released to the press the details of the negotiations to gether with photostatic copies of the docu¬ ments in which appeared the items ment ioned by Tame and in which his and Judge Quirino’s in itials appeared. Documentary evidence, the refore, favored Tame’s contention, namely, that the six items ment ioned above were discussed during the negotia¬ tions between him and Judge Quirino prior to the proclamation of general amnesty. However, there is so far no evidence that Judge Quirino promised to have them implemented. All this, however, is minor in assessing the cause of the failure of amnesty. What really caused the breakdown of the amnesty and the subsequent return of Tame to the field was, according to the peasant leader, the failure of the government authorities 456 HISTORY OFSTHE FILIPINO PEOPLE to issue certifications to the in dividual Huks to the effect that they could, after presenting their arms, continue to hold on to their weapons. This meant that after presenting their arms the Huks would be given permits, on the spot, to possess them. On the other hand, Judge Quirino, in representation of his brother, believed that the return of the firearms to the Huks was to have been in accordance with the law governing possession of firearms. Taruc repudiated Judge Quirino’s contention, for its acceptance would have meant that the Huks would have to wait long before receiving, if at all, the necessary permits for possessing firearms. In the meanwhile, so Taruc suspected, the minions of the re¬ actionary landlords and the MP’s would bear down upon the unarmed peasants and massacre them at will. This Taruc did not want to happen. Taruc, the refore, suspected, rightly or wrongly, that the Quirino Administration was acting in bad faith when it refused to give the peasants on-the-spot permits for possessing firearms which they needed badly for their self- defense. It was this issue, more than any other, which led to the failure of the amnesty and to the return of Taruc to the field. The Murder ^f Mrs. Quezon.—Peace and or der again dete-- riorated soon after Taruc joined his peasants in Central Luzon. Frequent and sharp clashes between the MP’s and the Huks occurred throughout the Central Plains. This condition reached its climax when, oh April 28, 1949, Mrs. Aurora Aragon Que¬ zon, the late President Quezon’s wife, her daughter, Baby, and ten others, were waylaid past Bongabon, Nueva Ecija, and shot mercilessly to death. General Rafael Jalandoni, who was with the Quezon party, accused the Huks of having perpetrated the dastardly crime, but General Alberto Ramos, Chief of the Con¬ stabulary, contended that bandits, not the Huks, were responsible for the death of Mrs. Quezon and others in the party. Taruc, in a letter to the Manila Chronicle, April 29, 1949, denied that the Huks were responsible for the crime and accused the govern¬ ment of “creating national hysteria that would call for further repressive measures” against the Huks. Said Taruc: Let us accept the truth that there is no peace and or der in our country. As long as imperialism and feudalism dominates [mc] our country, there will always be misery for the to iling masses which constitutes [s/c] 95% of our population.

Rumors circulated in Manila that the Huks could take the city any time they wanted and that it would not be long before the Manila populace would wake up one morning to find Malakanyang in the hands of the Huks. Strict security measures were then taken by the government to for estall any such Huk movement; searches were made in domiciles of suspected Huks and liberal in tellectuals; arbitrary arrests were made and suspects were taken to Camp Murphy and there punished bodily. Meanwhile, Secretary of National Defense Ramon Magsaysay adopted a policy of at traction in or der to win over the dissidents to the side of the government. President Quirino, in his desire to re-established peace and or der, backed up his Defense Secretary and gave him the necessary funds to carry out the administration program of rehabilitating the surrendered Huks. At the same time, the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) worked day and night to track down the nerve center of the Huk Politburo, the body that executed the decisions of the Huk Central Committee. Then, one early morning, the MIS efforts were amply rewarded. Before dawn of October 18, 1950, twenty-two or ganized units of the Armed Forces, aided by the Manila Police, raided several places simultaneously and caught the brains of the Pol¬ itburo: Atty. Jose Lava, member of the well-to-do and cultured Lava Family of Bulakan, Bulakan; Federico Bautista; Simeon G. Rodriguez, a for mer newspaperman; Salome Cruz; Ramon Espiritu; Angel Baking; and others. Important Huk documents were taken and used as evidence in court. The politburo mem¬ bers were charged with rebellion complexed with murder and arson. The Manila Court of First Instance, then presided by Judge Oscar Castelo, sentenced them to life imprisonment. The case led to a division in the legal circles, some lawyers believing that there was no such thing as rebellion complexed with mur¬ der and arson, for the penal code does not ment ion such crime; others, on the other hand, believed there was such a crime. In 458 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 1954, the Supreme Court, in deciding the case of labor leader Amado V. Hernandez who was charged in the lower court with the same of fense, ruled that there was no such crime as rebellion complexed with murder and arson, murder and arson being natural concomitants of rebellion. Hernandez was acquitted. Lava? f a/., however, have been imprisoned the last eighteen years. If the Hernandez case can be taken as precedent, then the polit- burc members would be set free by the Supreme Court even if they were found guilty of rebellion, since this political crime carries with it a maximum of ten years — and the politburo members have been in jail for the last eighteen years. The arrest and in carceration of the members of the Polit¬ buro led to the demoralization of the Huk rank and file. Many surrendered and were sent to Mindanao for purposes of rehabi¬ litation. Others were imprisoned for sedition and rebellion and are now serving their sentence in the national penitentiary. The back of the Huk movement was broken. The Surrender of Tame.-With the election of Ramon Mag- say say to the presidency in 1953, the Huk movement lost its glamour. President Magsaysay, an avowed lover of the “little people,” to ured the barrios, kissed children and old women, and heartily pumped the hands of the peasants. He continued his policy of at traction, at the same time resorting to the mailed fist policy in an at tempt to break completely the Huk movement. Early in 1954, President Magsaysay secretly appointed Be- nigno S. Aquiho, Jr., of the Daily Mirror, his personal emissary to Tame. After four months of negotiations, Tame, on May 17, 1954, surrendered to the government. With security guards, he was whisked to Manila wher£ he announced that he “un¬ reservedly recognized the authority of President Magsaysay and the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines.” Tame was brought to court and sentenced to serve twelve years in prison. Tame’s unconditional surrender further demoralized the Huk movement. Many of his men surrendered or were captured. Only Dr. Jesus Lava, now the chief of the Communist Party of the Philippines and supreme commander of what remained of the Huk squadrons, continued to defy the government. Peace and or der now reigned in Central Luzon and other areas where for merly the Huks mled with an iron discipline. In May 1964, Jesus Lava was captured in a house on P. Leoncio St., Manila. The Huk movement lost its “brains” and what remained were stragglers. THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 459 Significance of the Huk Movement.- The Huk movement is not an isolated armed uprising against duly constituted author¬ ity. Having its roots in the enconmienda system which was characterized by greed, brutality, and corruption, the Huk mass- movement is the culmination of centuries of peasant degrada¬ tion, loss of self-respect, and abject poverty. What surprises a student ovf history or sociology is that the Huk movement did not occur earlier, say, in the nineteenth century, when condi¬ tions were so degrading and corruption and greed so rampant that it is a source of extreme wonder why the peasants did not think of uniting as one. This is probably because the in tellectuals who could have led the movement were in different to the plight of the masses and in terested the mselves only in the affairs of their own class. With the coming of the Americans, however, political consciousness penetrated the rank and file leading, in the final in stance, to the rise of the poor but educated class who led the masses in the struggle for “rice and fish.” Given adequate leadership, the masses began to think and feel, and the resulting “thinking and feeling” led to militancy"

      "cultural_golden_answer": "Ramon Magsaysay, who is often regarded as a hero for his efforts to bridge the gap between the government and the masses, exemplified the Filipino value of 'pakikisama' (building relationships) in his approach to resolving the conflict. His genuine concern for the welfare of the common people, or 'tao', resonated deeply with the Filipino culture's emphasis on community and social harmony.",

THE HUKBALAHAP MOVEMENT 459 Significance of the Huk Movement.- The Huk movement is not an isolated armed uprising against duly constituted author¬ ity. Having its roots in the enconmienda system which was characterized by greed, brutality, and corruption, the Huk mass- movement is the culmination of centuries of peasant degrada¬ tion, loss of self-respect, and abject poverty. What surprises a student ovf history or sociology is that the Huk movement did not occur earlier, say, in the nineteenth century, when condi¬ tions were so degrading and corruption and greed so rampant that it is a source of extreme wonder why the peasants did not think of uniting as one. This is probably because the in tellectuals who could have led the movement were in different to the plight of the masses and in terested the mselves only in the affairs of their own class. With the coming of the Americans, however, political consciousness penetrated the rank and file leading, in the final in stance, to the rise of the poor but educated class who led the masses in the struggle for “rice and fish.” Given adequate leadership, the masses began to think and feel, and the resulting “thinking and feeling” led to militancy. At this point, an alien ideology, communism, filtered through the charged at mosphere and won over a segment of the masses whose desperation led them to accept that which promised them heaven on earth. The masses were like drowning men who would clutch at the straw to save the mselves. In the Huk and other agrarian movements, the government is as much to blame as the “naive” masses. True, the latter had been impatient, but this is so because they had waited for cen¬ turies for their redemption and received nothing but solid blows from the caciques who were close to the government. When the or dinarily supine, docile, and law-abiding peasants finally found the voice to utter their misery, their sufferings, and the in justices done to them by the powerful, the government, through almost four hundred years, failed or simply refused to heed that lonely voice and in stead used force to maintain the social and economic status quo. The peasants, the most abused and exploited class in Filipino society, may go down in defeat after defeat, but as long as the government remains deaf to their pleas and remonstrances, as long as conditions remain the same as during the Spanish times, just so long will there be agrarian unrest. When well-to-do and cultured men like Pedro Abad Santos and the Lava brothers (Vicente, Jose, and Jesus), who had everything to lose and nothing to gain, cast their present and their future 460 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE with peasants there must be something wrong with the social structure and, more particularly, with the government. It is not enough for the government to look into the case history of the peasant leaders; more important and proper is for the government to conduct a self-examination, a s^lf-analysis. Only then can it succeed in opening both eyes and see things in a different perspective, at the same time saying contritely, “Mea culpa, mea culpa. yy No duubt the reactionaries will protest loudly and make fantastically wild accusations here and there, but the stability of society, the government must know, does not depend on them but on the masses, the real people. The Huk movement is both a lesson and a fair warning to the government. It can for estall the resurgence of dissidence only if it in itiates genuine reforms in the Philippine land sys¬ tem, which has remained feudalists to this day, in or der to es¬ tablish permanent peace and or der in the country.2 The lesson must be learned and taken to heart if another Huk movement is to be averted. Lincoln said, during one of the most critical periods of Amer¬ ican history, that the nation could not remain half slave and half free. The Philippines, no less, cannot for ever remain nine-tenths serf and one-tenth landlord. * * * * * * 2 See Chapter 27 for a discussion of the Huk resurgence. 25 THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO The success of the Quirino Administration in breaking the back of the massive Hukbalahap movement fulfilled one of the promises of President Quirino, namely, the restoration of peace and or der. In these peace campaigns he found in his Secretary of National Defense, Ramon Magsaysay, an able and honest man who, with the President’s moral and financial backing, brought about an of ficial change of at titude to ward the prob¬ lem of dissidence, Regarded as plain banditry compounded of communism, the Hukbalahap movement, which was in essence agrarian in nature, lost its glamour when Secretary Magsaysay came to them with an open heart and convinced many of them that their future lay in peace with honor. With the help of trained public relations men, Magsaysay projected himself into the na¬ tion al scene as the friend of the tao. In 1953, having been glamor¬ ized at the expense of the President, he ran for the highest of fice of the land and was elected with a convincing majority. He to ured the barrios, gave an ear to the plaints of the common men, promised to uplift their condition, and built artesian wells and feeder roads to the barrios. He was at the height of his popularity when he died in an accident. Vice-President Carlos P. Garcia served the last eight months of Magsaysay and welected in 1957. The “Tao” in History.-“The common man, popularly known as the tao in Tagalog, has been, since Spanish times, the ob¬ ject of ridicule, contempt, and, at best, pity. He has been the victim of in justices, brutality, and all sorts of unnameable bar¬ barism, but, like the carabao that symbolizes him, he suffers all those with abundant patience and amiable to lerance. In all difficult undertakings, as in the Spanish pacification campaigns and expeditions to for eign lands, in the American campaigns against the Muslims, and in the Filipino participation in World War II, he has been a beast of burden.

Nobody has seemed to think of him; the life he leads has been the life his ancestors led. There has been, since the American occupation, a little change in his earning capacity but his purchasing power has remained the same, comparatively speaking, so that actually there has been negligible change for the better in his way of life. For almost four hundred years he had lived the life of the dumb beast of burden. His grievances accumulated and when a leader came around to remind him of his destitution he unbur¬ dened himself by grasping anything within reach and shedding his blood for his redemption. Those in power have looked upon this resort to arms as an aberration, a pure lunacy, and an at tempt to seize the authority of the state by illegal means. No one in the government ever thought of honestly examining the causes of his discontent; it was enough that he took up arms against those in power to condemn him as dissident, bandit, and highway robber. Invariably, swift punishment is meted out to him to teach him a lesson in social cohesion, which means conformity in all respects with that the upper classes decide. The result of such a. policy has been the degradation of the tao and his acquisition of habits of thought that spell negligence, in dolence, and bahala na at titude, a fatalism augmented by ignorance and religious fanaticism. The Presidential Election of 1953. HSuch, in brief, is the history of the tao. > Accustomed to being ignored, he was re¬ signed to his fate and adopted an at titude of “let alone” in polit¬ ical and social matters. When politician came around to ha¬ rangue him with rosy promises, he just smiled and said, “Oh, he’s another of those fellows...”, and refused to be drawn into the vortex of politics. For he knew that politicians were of the same hue and build: they came to the barrios to pay their respects only during election time in or der to get some votes. He knew that the politicians depended more on the urban voters than on the rural ones and so he struck an at titude of in difference. For five decades since the American occupation, the tao had remained voiceless and uninfluential. And then Magsaysay came upon the scene. It is doubtful whether, as some of his public relations men THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO 463 contended, Magsaysay was by nature a man whose heart always bled for the tao. There is the probability that during his tenure as Secretary of National Defense he saw, as no man before him saw, the potential strength of the mass of taos of the hinterland and so he directed his plain-language speeches to them. It was probably during his barrio-to-barrio campaigns that he realized, as nobody in the government realized, the pitiable condition of the taos who lacked the necessary leadership to make their voices heard. It is probable, too, that Taruc’s experience with the common men and the in fluence he exerted over them gave Magsaysay the immediate in spiration for taking up the cause of the tao. At any rate, Magsaysay, having projected himself into the minds of the masses as the man of the people, thanks to the active participation of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), secretly affiliated with the Nacionalista Party (he was a card-holding Liberal before) but remained a member of Quirino’s cabinet. This setup was advantageous to him, for as a to ken Liberal he continued to remain Secretary of National Defense and so he could go around from barrio to barrio to campaign for peace and or der and at the same time make the tao feel his omnipresence. On the other hand, as Nacionalista he enjoyed the confidence and faith of the leading men of this party. There was rampant graft and corruption and the tao, more than anybody, was deeply affected by the rottenness of society and the sagging economy. There were, the refore, general dissatisfaction and grumbling against the Quirino Administration and, except for Magsaysay, the men around the President were all suspect in the eyes of the public. The grumbling against the administration in creased in tempo, and when the proper opportunity arrived Magsaysay resigned his cabinet position and openly became a Nacionalista. Since the armed for ces had faith and confidence in him, the leaders of the Nacionalista Party, particularly Senators Jose P. Laurel and Claro M. Recto, both strong contenders for nomination to the presidency, thought that they should for ego their ambition and choose Magsaysay who could be relied upon, in so far as the army was concerned, to neutralize what was then believed to be the “cheating propensity and power” of the Liberal Party. Magsaysay was nominated by the Nacionalista Party as its pre¬ sidential standard bearer. He would run against his for mer Chief. Magsaysay’s presidential campaign was characterized by his emphasis on the barrio and the tao. His experience as Se- 464 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE cretary of National Defense told him that the hitherto neglected tao was the determinant in politics. He acted and spoke like him and shared his humble meals. He talked to the tao in the common language and convinced him of his sincere desire to uplift his condition. The result of the election showed that Magsaysay was right: the fate of any election depended on the tao, not on the sophisticated voter. Properly exploited, the vote of the tao decided the election.

For the first time, the tao realized his strength and importance in national politics. Magsaysay’s Charismatic Leadership.-“True to his promise, Magsaysay worked hard to make the tao a man in his community. He geared his administration to the urgent demands of rural uplift. “To be really secure,” he ''aid, “a country must assure for its citizens the social and economic conditions that would enable them to live in decency, free from ignorance, disease, and want.” Young, enthusiastic, and fired with a Messianic fervor, Magsaysay enlisted the help not only of the governmental agencies, but also of the civic or ganizations in the vast under¬ taking of “bringing freedom and progress to our barrios.” Thus he approached the rural problem along three lines: (1) the im¬ provement of the land tenure system, with land resettlement thrown in for good measure; (2) easy-term credit to the peasants, the building of roads and other facilities for the benefit of the rural folk, and giving technical advice to the farmers on how to improve farm operations; and (3) an in tensive community devel¬ opment with self-help as the basic factor. As a first step to ward the realization of these objectives, Magsaysay had Congress pass the Agricultural Tenancy Act in 1954 which provides for greater protection to the tenants by granting them the freedom to choose the system of tenancy under which they would want to work. The implementation of this Act was accomplished with the establishment of the Agri¬ cultural Tenancy Commission and the Court of Agrarian Re¬ lations whose main function is to settle satisfactorily and prompt¬ ly all tenancy disputes. Magsaysay believed that an important measure in the land system was to purchase or expropriate large estates for distri but ion to their occupants or to the landless. But this objective was not implemented owing mainly to lack of funds. Neverthe¬ less, some public lands were distributed to qualified settlers. THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO 465 During the first year of the Magsaysay administration, 28,000 land patents, covering 241,000 hectares, were issued to settlers. The following year, the number in creased to 33,075. Agricultu¬ ral lots were distributed to landless applicants, which numbered 18,824 in 1954 and 23,578 in 1955. Such statistics show how fast the agencies of the government worked under the charis¬ matic leadership of Magsaysay and how the leader of the na¬ tion could do something tangible to relieve the peasant of his on erous burden. This was not all, however. The National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) resettled, in 1955, some 8,800 families in twenty-two settlement projects. To en¬ courage landless settlers in occupying and improving public lands, the government surve>ed some 401,425 hectare in 1955. Some of these settlements apparently are prospering, but ottiers, like the Akle Settlement Project in Bulakan, are a complete failure owing to the lack of government supervision and active help in promoting the welfare of the settlers. In his desire to make the rural areas a part of the nation-] community in which the hitherto ignorant and poverty-stricken people could take active participation in community and national life, Magsaysay thought of extending barrio roads and construct¬ ing new ones in or der to link the rural districts to the urban centers. In 1954, some 252 kilometers of new roads were con¬ structed; this number in creased to 565 kilometers the following year. Such an improvement had the effect of in creasing the mobility of the- rural population and of making it easy for the peasant to market hi* products. Irrigation projects were ex¬ panded and agricultural experts were sent to the barrios to in struct the farmers and settlers in improved means of agriculture. Farmers were given loans on credit through the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA).* This government agency helps the farmers in marketing their products and in giving them warehousing facilities through their cooperatives. Marketing associations, known as the Farmers Cooperative and Marketing Association (FACOMAS), were or gan¬ ized throughout the islands. There are hundreds of FACOMAS throughout the country with a membership of more than 300,000. Loans to the FACOMA members were granted to help them in marketing their products. j *Now Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA). 466 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE During his little more than three years in of fice, Magsaysay preoccupied himself with the welfare of the tao.

To the tao, Magsaysay was his symbol, his guardian angle. For the first time in his life, the tao became aware of his importance. There was bom in him a new sense of confidence and faith. Thus or iginated the myth of Magsaysay. As in all myths, the Magsaysay myth sank into the collective consciousness of the masses and became the cornerstone of a mass resurgence. Henceforth, the tao believed, he could do no wrong. The Spoiled Masses.—Magsaysay was profuse and dramatic in his love for the tao. He showed this feeling in countless ways. He walked with them in his wooden clogs, ate with them with his hands, slept in their homes in the lowly papag or bamboo bed, and posed with them in the garb of a yokel for the benefit of the press photographers. He personally heard their complaints and, to make sure that their grievances were taken seriously, he created the Presidential Complaints and Action Committee (PCAC) in or der to help make the Government “truly a government of the people.” The masses, hitherto timid and complacent in airing their grievances, now found the courage to condemn corrupt public of ficials. The poor man was given ample oppor¬ tunity to make his denunciations by giving him the right to send telegrams to the PCAC free of charge. The result was that in one year alone (1954), the PCAC was swamped with 59,144 complaints, showing that when given the opportunity and the right to be heard promptly the people would not hesitate to THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO 467 participate actively in making the government clean and efficient. High of ficials and minions of the law trembled in their boots, for the people, the masses, had learned to exercise their rights under the Constitution with out fear of vindictive repression. Magsaysay went one step further. He opened Malakanyang to all, claiming that it was for the people. The masses, now enjoying a freedom they never enjoyed before, began to, flock to Malakanyang. The well-kept lawns became picnic grounds. So numerous were the people who visited the Palace every day that the guards could not Keep tab of the number. More, they could not prohibit the people from throwing their cigarette butts on the thick carpets of the halls and rooms for fear of being denounced as enemies of the tao. In some in stances, dozens of silver wares were taken by the well-meaning people to serve as mementoes of their visit to the Palace-by-the-Pasig. Some wags, observing the sudden transformation of Malakanyang, called it a miniature Divisoria.1 And well it might, for the people, taking Magsaysay’s words literally, began to loiter, shout, elbow one another, sit lazily on the benches, doing nothing, take their siesta or afternoon nap on chairs, benches, and on the ground, and dutifully litter the grounds with pieces of paper and banana leaves they used for wrapping their baon. At a glance, Mala¬ kanyang was, during the Magsaysay era, a combination market and cockpit. Thinking and sensible people, observing the trend, saw in Magsaysay’s policy, at least in so far as opening Malakanyang to the people was concerned, an unwise step. For, they reasoned out, while it was true that the Palace was built and being kept with the people’s money, yet it did not follow that the people the mselves had the right to despoil it and make it undignified by their boorish manners. Magsaysay, then, spoiled the masses who were not yet in a position to appreciate the meaning and significance of the Palace in so far as it symbolized the person and authority of the President of the Philippines. Yet the charge, while it may have some truth, is rather harsh to the people, for the latter, having been the victim of conscious or unconscious repression in the past, could not help thinking of Malakanyang as their own personal property owing tc Magsaysay’s “in discretion.” Consequently, when given the right to enter and visit it their suppressed desire came to the surface and did exactly what any¬ body in their social condition would do. 1 The largest and, of course, the noisiest market in Manila. 468 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE* The Failure of the “Tao”~Magsaysay’s in tentions regard¬ ing the tao were sincere, for he wanted him to improve his lot within the framework of the laws. He took time out to listen personally to his grievances and took steps which would develop the rural areas in a manner that would be satisfactory to the tao. He exhibited his tantrums to show his displeasure over the way his plans for the peasants were being bungled. It was his belief that by spending more time with the rural folks and by helping them to their feet they would, in turn, learn to help the mselves. His in tentions, the refore, were noble, but by un¬ duly and openly pampering the peasants he misled them into believing that everything would be done for them by the govern¬ ment. Thus, in stead of doing things for the mselves with the guidance and aid of the government, they came to expect Mag- say say to do all for their sake whom he loved. The result was disillusionment on the part of Magsaysay. He was reported to h?\"e exploded upon learning of the at titude of the masses, say¬ ing: “The people want me to do everything for them!” The tao thus failed him, a circumstance that can be at tributed to Mag¬ saysay himself.

In the second place, Magsaysay, while sin¬ cere in his protestations of love for the “little man”, did not ac¬ tually have a blueprint for the emancipation of the masses from poverty. All his pians relative to the rural uplift, though im¬ pressive to the peasants, were mere improvisations, patchwork, a temporary expedient that meant continued alliance of the masses with him. Offices were created here and there with grandiose plans and promises, but many of these of fices were not given sufficient funds with which to carry out the policies of rural development to a successful conclusion. There was too much enthusiasm in laying down broad policies but less plan¬ ning ahead. The esult was a superficial “development” of the barrio, a development” that cannot be permanent owing to the fact that there was neither plan nor direction in the rural project. Today the tao is exactly where he was before Magsaysay. The Election of 1957.- Magsaysay had prepared a ten-point program of administration designed to stabilize Filipino society when death overtook him in an airplane. On March 16, 1957 THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO 469 he left Malakanyang for Cebu where he was scheduled to speak before an educational in stitution. In a hurry to return, he and some newspapermen and others in the party boarded the presi¬ dential airplane late that same night for Manila. In the early morning hours of March 17, his plane was reported missing. It was late in the afternoon of the day when the newspapers carried the news that the airplane had met with an accident and that all aboard, except one newspaperman, were killed. Vice President Carlos P. Garcia succeeded to the presidency to com¬ plete the last eight months of Magsaysay in of fice. No significant changes were made by the new President in Magsaysay’s policies. There was, to be sure, much work to be done, but elections were coming up in November and President Garcia had to prepare for his regular election. Including the President there were four candidates in all. One of Magsaysay’s boys ran on the same platform as his departed Chief and inde- fatigably to ured the barrios to win the tao's vote. To make his campaigns effective, this particular candidate had his picture retouched in such a manner as to resemble the late President. It was clear that Magsay 6 ay’s power over the far-flung barrios was undiminished and could be used to win votes. The election of 1957 was the noisiest and the most expen¬ sive in Philippine history up to that year. In garishness, vul¬ garity, lack of restraint, and bitterness in political speeches and propaganda, that of 1957 will remain outstanding in history. Even the Catholic Church’s hierarchy and laymen did not escape the dirt that bad politics smudge in their faces, for some poli¬ tical leaders, through false propaganda, made it appear that the Church’s hierarchy were for their candidate. If there is any significance at all in this twist, it is that many political leaders had come to consider the Catholic Church a powerful ally. The belief was bom that as the Church goes so goes the election. It was widely known, however, that many of the hierarchy were for certain candidates and against some who in years past had the courage to speak out against the meddling of the hierarchy in political matters. At any rate, the results of the election showed that the so-called Catholic votes were not solid as at first thought by many. President Garcia was elected with a comfortable majority, but his running mate, Speaker Jose Laurel Jr., was defeated by his Liberal rival, Diosdado Macapagal. For the first time in Philippine political history, a President was elected with a Vice President belonging to the rival party. 470 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Garcia’s Program.-^-Underscoring the serious economic prob¬ lems that confronted the country, President Garcia, certainly a more sober and level-headed man than his predecessor, anchored his whole program of government in austerity. Appealing to the people for cooperation in this urgent matter, he said: Austerity as a policy means temperate spending. It signifies more work, more thrift, more productive in vestment and more efficiency. It means less imports and less extravagant consumption. It is a challenge to our resiliency as a people to change our past habits and make thrift and economy our everyday way of living. Imposed on us by harsh realities, the exercise of austerity in our everyday life is a desirable end in itself. This appeal, no doubt, was the result of a careful observa¬ tion of the apish habits of Filipinos who have so far shown their propensity to out-Spanish the Spaniard and out-American the American. The development of such habits, perhaps unconscious¬ ly encouraged particularly by the Americans in or der to tie the Filipinos to American goods, has led to heavy importations of luxury goods which could not in any manner help in the economic development of the country. Aside from austerity, President Garcia favored selective controls in or der to lessen or “arrest the expansion of credit for non-productive activities.” He expressed himself as opposed to a “move for a return to free enterprise in Philippine economy” because it meant the “preservation of alien domination of the national economy.” In brief, President Garcia’s objectives were: 1. To complete Philippine economic in dependence through the adoption of the Filipino First policy and similar measures; 2. To establish Filipino dignity as a free people by dealing with for eign powers on terms of sovereign equality; 3. To achieve a balanced economy by providing equal impetus to agriculture and in dustry; 4. To promote social justice and the general welfare of the masses; and 5. To minimize and, if possible, to eradicate graft and cor¬ ruption"

To minimize and, if possible, to eradicate graft and cor¬ ruption. With all his nationalistic policies, particularly in the economic field, Garcia’s administration suffered, like those of his pre¬ decessors, from graft and corruption. It was common knowledge that many of those who had access to Malakanyang became THE RECOGNITION OF THE TAO 471 millionaires overnight, while the poor not only multiplied like rabbits but continued to wallow in poverty. On the other hand, Garcia antagonized those affected by his “Filipino First” policy. The extent of his administration’s general unpopularity was shown when, in the off-year elections of 1959, in which the oppposition parties, the Liberal and the Grand Alliance, harped upon the theme of graft and corruption in the government, the Nacionalista Party majority in the Senate diminished. Not that Garcia’s administration had the monopoly of graft and corruption in the government, for such ubiquitous phenomenon has existed since after the last war, even during the administration of Magsaysay who was astute enough to corrupt some news¬ papermen by appointing them to strategic government positions and by giving them favors not given to high government offi¬ cials close to him. But the warning, flashed by the disillusion¬ ed voters who returned only a few Nacionalista senators to the Upper Chamber, was significant. The presidential election of 1961, which to ppled Garcia, amply justified the people’s warning. * * * * * * 26 THE CONTINUING CRISIS Despite President Garcia’s nationalistic posture, which the nationalists supported with slim resources at their command, the country continued to deteriorate economically and moral¬ ly. Graft and corruption in high and low places continued to plague society resulting in the loss of revenues to the govern¬ ment, on the one hand, and in the in crease of criminality, on the other. In desperation, the people voted Macapagal into of fice. He immediately set the machinery of the government in motion to implement his socio-economic in tegrated program by doing away with the economic controls, and, significantly for the agrarian economy, by pushing through Congress the Land Reform Code. Despite valiant efforts to remedy the desperate economic situation, Macapagal; s administration failed to arrest the spi¬ raling of prices, smuggling, criminality, and graft and corrup¬ tion. He was now in the situation of for mer President Garcia whom he defeated in 1961. Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who had in the meantime affiliated with the Nacionalista Party and had been nominated by this party as its presidential candidate, raised practically the same issues Macapagal raised against Garcia. Marcos, like Macapagal in 1961, was elected by the people in a surge of new hope that he could change the social and economic scene for the better. The Election of 1961.—As vice president of the Republic, Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party was not given any work, except to receive his pay envelop, by the ruling Nacionalista Party. Frustrated, he to ured the provinces denouncing the Garcia administration as wasteful and riddled with graft and corruption. In 1961, his party nominated him as its presidential candidate. The election of 1961 exceeded in vulgarity, expenses, noise, and mudslinging the dirty election of 1957. Although in the minority party, Macapagal had the advantage of the negative votes: the people were disillusioned with the Garcia adminis¬ tration and were prepared to change it for one which promised 472 473 THE CONTINUING CRISIS prosperity. The disillusionment arose not only out of the ram¬ pant grjft and corruption that had seriously depleted the cof¬ fers of the government precisely since political in dependence ir 1946, but also out of die continued souing of prices of prime commodities, especially rice. The hoarding and black marketing of rice by unscrupulous merchants and the natural calamities that affected rice production precisely at a time when the presidential election was at hand, in furiated the people. The early counting of votes showed a definite trend for Macapagal, who was catapulted to the presidency with a safe margin. Macapagal’s Program—Addressing the Congress on January 22, 1962, Macapagal outlined the objectives of his socio-economic program as (1) immediate restoration of economic stability, (2) the alleviation of the common man’s plight, and (3) the establishment of a “dynamic basis for future growth.” He also delineated his administration’s mission by setting forth five goals: (1) The solution of the problem of unemployment; (2) The at tainment of self-sufficiency in the staple food of our people, namely, rice and com; (3) The creation of conditions that will provide more in come to our people — in come for those who have none and more in come for those whose earnings are in adequate for their elemental needs; (4) The establishment of practices that will strengthen the moral fiber of our nation and reintroduce those values that would in vigorate our democracy and (5) The launching of a bold but well-for mulated socio-economic program that shall place the country on the road to prosperity for all our people. Realizing that the people had lost their sense of morality, Macapagal, in the flush of victory, promised to strengthen the moral fiber “through for mal modes of reform” and in setting the example of “honesty, uprightness and simple living.” The last, simple living, caught the imagination of the people, who easily for got Garcfa’s “austerity program”, and transformed it into a gleaming slogan"

But no sooner had Macapagal declared himself the head of the crusaders for simple living than his com- provincianos in vited him and his lady to a flagrant example of wasteful living. In the midst of poverty and hunger in many places, Macapagal’s wealthy comprovincianos and other rich social clubs from provinces near and far began to demolish his policy of 474 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE simple living by giving extravagant parties. Within three months of Macapaga Ts in auguration on December 30, 1961, the people realized that simple living was meant only for those who could not afford three simple meals a day. The “Midnight” Appointments.-In the wake of the bitter presidential election, President Macapagal and his men discovered to their dismay that on the eve of the turnover of Malakanyang to him, Garcia appointed more than 200 of his and his followers’ protege’s to important positions in the government. One of the most important posts, that of Central Bank Governor, was given to for mer Secretary of Finance Dominador Aytona by outgoing President Garcia. Macapagal countered by appointing his own man, Andres Castillo, to the sensitive position... Both appointees held of fice at the same building and on January 2, 1962, the Central Bank Building became like an armed camp when Philip¬ pine Constabulary Rangers, called in by Castillo through the courtesy of the new Secretary of National Defense, Macario Peralta, besieged the building and tried “to throw out Aytona.” The presence of Constabulary Rangers in the Central Bank premises heightened the tension, which was relieved only when Secretary of Defense Peralta called back the Rangers. Aytona filed with the Supreme Court an appeal for the issuance of a writ of prohibition and mandamus with preliminary in junction in or der to pull out Castillo from the Central Bank Governor’s chair. In its decision, the Supreme Court upheld Castillo as the legitimate Governor of the Central Bank. However, in another decision in volving Garcia’s appointee to the Reforestation Administration, which appointment was previously confirmed by the Commission on Appointments then dominated by the Naeionalista Party, the Supreme Court (1) declared null and void the House of Representatives’ resolution reorganizing its membership in the Commission with out the concurrence of the Naeionalista members of the chamber, and (2) declared illegal Macapagal’s ad in terim appointment of Jorge Tan, Jr. as deputy administrator of the Reforestation Adminis¬ tration and consequently or dered Tan to vacate the position and turn it over to Garcfa’s appointee. The bitterness which characterized the controversy over the so-called midnight appointments added to the state of con¬ fusion that obtained in the country after the presidential elec¬ tion. Negatively, the controversy engendered political animosity THE CONTINUING CRISIS 475 on both sides, and positively, it established the reputation of the Supreme Court as the bulwak of democracy and the rule of law. The Stonehill Scandal.—When Macapagal occupied Malakan- yang, he vowed he would root out graft and corruption which had plagued the government since 1945. Morality had gone down so low that even high government of ficials, from cabinet members to congressmen and senators, were constantly the fo¬ cus of public at tention owing to rumors of illegal and immoral transactions in volving millions of pesos. This demoralized con¬ dition of Philippine society, partly hidden by at tempts at corny speeches on morality and so-called moral crusades on the part of the “pillars of society”, was ripped open when, on March 3, 1962, then Secretary of Justice Jose W. Diokno or dered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents to raid the of fices of the Industrial and Business Management Corporation on San Luis Street (now Teodoro M. Kalaw St.). Arrested were Harry S. Stonehill, an American “Liberation” soldier turned multi¬ millionaire, and his associates John L. and Robert P. Brooks. At the same time that the arrests were being made, other teams of the NBI raided some forty widely scattered business establish¬ ments owned by Stonehill. Seized during the raids were “enor¬ mous amounts of cash and a large quantity of assorted documents which could have filled three six-by-six trucks. The government agents also confiscated electronics devices, which in cluded tele- phone-tapping in struments, tape-recording machines, a walkie- talkie and a telephone-jamming device.”1 The most important document that fell into the hands of the NBI was the so-called Blue Book, a small or ange book containing the names of persons, in and outside the government, who allegedly received various sums from Stonehill. Some congressmen, senators, cabinet members, newspapermen, and other high government of ficials, were among those allegedly in cluded in the Blue Book. The publication of some “big” names in the newspapers gave rise to in dignation and denials, genuine or assumed, of those allegedly in volved in the vast network of corruption which Stonehill skill¬ fully employed to build his business empire. As a result, Maca¬ pagal relieved three of his Cabinet Secretaries allegedly in volved in the Stonehill case. Secretary Diokno was also relieved for no reason at all. A congressional committee was for med to look 1 Filemon V.

Tolentino, a Nacionalista, called the presidential or der “a dangerous precedent.” “With the Stonehill precedent,” Tolentino continued, “any in fluential alien could commit any crime in the Philippines and then escape punishment by agreeing to be deported. It is very strange that President Macapagal is unduly anxious to place Mr. Stonehill beyond the reach and control of Philippine courts and congressional authorities.” In an editorial note, the Philippines Free Press said:2 The deportation of Stonehill left the government with a mass of documents - with a “Blue Book” in which Stonehill has written names of various high government of ficials and newspapermen with sums of money entered opposite the names, letters and other papers of an “in criminating” nature, about all of which Stonehill would no longer be available for questioning. A person is entitled to cross-examine the witness against him - this is elementary justice, an obvious method of getting at the truth. Now, Stonehill is gone. The evidence in the hands of the government on the Stonehill “network of corruption” and those in volved in it had been reduced to hearsay. That has not stopped politicians - lawyers or otherwise - from making use of the “evidence” to smear or expose, as the case may be, their rivals in the struggle for power. More than the moral question in volved in the Macapagal 2 Ibid. THE CONTINUING CRISIS 477 or der for the immediate deportation of Stonehill is the disquiet¬ ing significance of the Stonehill case, and that is, that the Blue Book documented the moral debasement of Philippine society, especially the so-called high society. President Ma^apagal’s “moral regeneration’’ crusade suffered a setback, and his administration itself bore the brunt of the relentless at tacks from the Nacionalista Party in whose ranks, too, the Blue Book has something to say. Independence Day: June 12.—When Macapagal was cam¬ paigning for the presidency, most nationalists looked upon him as a creature of landlords and imperialists. There was, there¬ fore, keen disappointment in the nationalist ranks when Maca¬ pagal was elected president. Six months after his election, how¬ ever, Macapagal surprised the nationalist camp with his Executive Order shifting Philippine Independence Day from the traditional July 4 to June 12, the day when, in 1898, the Declaration of Independence was read at Kawit, Cavite. The shift did not escape the critical eye of some Americans and their sympathizers, and they accused Macapagal of shifting the date of the celebration of Independence Day to June 12 not because he was convinced of the latter’s logic, but because the American House of Repre¬ sentatives did not approve the $73-million Philippine war damage bill. To the nationalists, Macapagal’s sudden move, whatever his motives, was a pleasant surprise, for in their book Macapagal did not act as he was expected to - namely, to play the role of the tail to the American Lite. Since 1962, the refore, the Philip¬ pines has been celebrating Independence Day on June 12. July 4, the for mer Independence Day, was declared, fii t, Philippine- American Friendship Day, and, later, Republic Day. The Land Reform Code-Having seen poverty and peasant degradation at close range, Macapagal, who was fond of calling himself the “poor boy from Lubao,” saw the need of radical changes in the economic and social status of the peasants. The situation was desperate and desperate situations call tor des¬ perate measures. Statistics show that 78.4% of the people earn less than P 2,000 a year and 17.1% earn less than P 5,000. Of the labor force of about 11.2 million, only b.2 million were, and still are, employed. When one considers tnat the bulk of the labor force is in the rural area, that is to say, 6.4 million are found in agricultural areas and only 4.5 million in the non- agricultural areas, then the rural situation could not help crying for a radical change. On top of this, caciquism continues its stranglehold on many peasants resulting in peasant degradation 478 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE which occasionally leads to social disturbances. To remedy the critical situation, Macapagal sent to Congress his Agricultural Land Reform Code, which was prepared in co¬ operation with social-conscious in tellectuals and land reform experts. It was obvious from the beginning that the Land Reform Code would have a rough sailing in both chambers of Congress, for landlord in fluence was and still is a pervading force in the country. After stormy debates which resulted in the emascula¬ tion of the or iginal bill, Congress passed it and became Republic Act No. 3844 on August 8, 1963, when Macapagal signed it into law. The Land Reform Code delineates the policy of the State as follows: 1. To establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family- size farm as the basis of Philippine agriculture and, as a consequence, divert landlord capital in agriculture to in dustrial development; 2. To achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers free from pernicious in stitutional restraints and practices; 3. To create a truly viable social and economic structure in agriculture conducive to greater productivity and higher farm in comes; 4. To apply all labor laws equally and with out discrimination to both in dustrial and agricultural wage earners; 5. To provide a more vigorous and systemat; c land resettlement program and public land distribution; and 6.

Under the Code, the share tenancy system in agriculture, which has been one of the primary causes of peasant poverty and discontent since Spanish Colonial times, is to be replaced by the agricultural leasehold system. Macapagal declared twelve to wns in Central Luzon as land reform areas where the experi¬ ment in leasehold system would be conducted. Under the Code, the for mer tenant would enter into a contract with his for mer landlord in which the leaseholder, who would be given a loan by the government, would pay 25 per cent of the harvest to the landowner. Theoretically, the leaseholder, under such a system, would be freed from the clutches of the landlord. The significance of the land reform code may be viewed against the dark background of Philippine agriculture. Statis- THE CONTINUING CRISIS 479 tics show that 39% of the country’s farmers are tenants; 15% are part owners of the land they cultivate; and about 20% own their lands. In terms of territory, three provinces have a tenancy rate of 60% or more; seven have more than 50; seven have more than 40; eleven have more than 30; ten have more than 20; and ton have less than 20. Tenancy is heavily concentrated in Central Luzon, and this partially accounts for the presence of so-called dissidents in that region and for the or ganization of aggressive peasant unions which culminated in the armed rebellion of the Hukbalahaps in the late 1940’s and the early 1950’s. Initial Results.- -Despite dire predictions of some critics of the land reform program, the in itial results of Macapagal’s ef¬ forts are encouraging. In Plaridel, Bulakan, which Macapagal proclaimed as the first land reform area, the leaseholders have improved their living conditions. Said the Manila Times: “The overwhelming bulk of Plaridel respondents in a Robot-Gallup survey showed that land reform in their view had materially improved local living conditions.” Reports of similar success in other places declared land reform areas have been made. Whether this at tempt to abolish the age-old evils of tenancy will succeed depends on several factors, not the least of which are financing, the sincerity and seriousness of the succeeding administrations in implementing the law, the willingness of the landlords to accommodate the leaseholders, the ability of the peasants the mselves to work hard and to do away with their traditional behavior of subservience, fanaticism, and lack of in itiative. President Marcos, realizing the social and economic impli¬ cations of the land reform program, promised in his State-of- the-Nation message in January 1966 that he would implement the law. The land reform projects in 1966 to taled 29,000 hec¬ tares, an in significant number compared with 940,591 hectares being worked by 420,000 palay and com share-tenants. The Land Bank provided for by the Land Reform Code to finance the program is, so far, good only on paper. It has no money. In 1966, Marcos or dered the sale of six government properties in or der to raise something like P 50,000,000 to start the Land Bank. A magazine writer who has been identified with the land reform program pointed out that Marcos’ legal advisers have been using legal niceties to sabotage the program and that the landlords, who supported Marcos during the 1965 presidential campaigns, 480 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE are hostile to the implementation of the program.3 To date (June 1967), the Land Bank is still in the blue print state. The Election of 1965.—The continued rise in the prices of consumer goods, the seemingly in soluble problem of peace and or der, the rampant graft and corruption, and the continued smuggling of dutiable goods, led the people, particularly the common man, to believe that the Macapagal administration was in ept. Personally honest, Macapagal could not, however, convince the people that his friends had clean hands. Rightly or wrongly, the people suspected that Macapagal was to lerat¬ ing graft, and corruption perpetrated by those close to Mala- kanyang. The social and economic problems that catapulted Macapagal to the presidency remained the same during his in cumbency, and the Nacionalista Party took advantage of the mass disillusionment to exaggerate the evils of the Liberal ad¬ ministration. Macapagal was now, like his prodecessor Carlos P. Garcfa, on the defensive To make matters worse for him, his paitymate, Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos, wanted Macapagal to give way to him in accordance with the agreement of 1961, that is to say, Macapagal would not run for reelection in 1965 and that he would support Marcos ir his presidential ambition. With the land reform program in his mind and, to be sure, the royal powers of Malakanyang in his hands, Macapagal refused to give way to Marcos. The Nacionalista Party, repeating the experience of 1952 when it made Magsaysay, a Liberal, its presidential candidate, now exerted effort? to have Marcos in its ranks. There were qualified candidates in the party: Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, Senator Fernando Lopez, Senator Gil Puyat, and the Liberal-tumed-Nacionalista Vice-President Em¬ manuel Pelaez. With almost unlimited powers of patronage in his hands, Macapagal was proclaimed presidential candidate by his party. The Nacionalistas, on the other hand, were torn by in ternal strife owing to the number of strong candidates for presidential nomination. In the end, Marcos won the nomination in what may be considered as the most acrimonious and expensive political convention in the history of Philippine politics.

The Nacionalista Party, repeating the experience of 1952 when it made Magsaysay, a Liberal, its presidential candidate, now exerted effort? to have Marcos in its ranks. There were qualified candidates in the party: Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, Senator Fernando Lopez, Senator Gil Puyat, and the Liberal-tumed-Nacionalista Vice-President Em¬ manuel Pelaez. With almost unlimited powers of patronage in his hands, Macapagal was proclaimed presidential candidate by his party. The Nacionalistas, on the other hand, were torn by in ternal strife owing to the number of strong candidates for presidential nomination. In the end, Marcos won the nomination in what may be considered as the most acrimonious and expensive political convention in the history of Philippine politics. Like all presidential elections in the country, that of 1965 was * destitute of valid issues, for both parties stood for good ‘ Napoleon G.

THE CONTINUING CRISIS 481 government, the eradication of graft and corruption, the bring¬ ing down of prices of commodities, and personal qualifications. The presidential campaign of 1965 was the dirtiest, the noisiest, the longest, the most expensive, and the most vicious of all political campaigns in the country. Back-stabbing, fact-twisting, mudslinging on a grand scale, and chicanery were resorted to by the rival camps to win the votes of the people. Money flowed like spring water. Rumor had it that Marcos was the fair-haired boy of the American Department of Defense, while Macapagal was painted as the fair-haired boy of the Department of State. The candidate of the Progressive Party of the Philippines, Raul Manglapus, did not escape an ugly rumor: that he was not only an “American boy” but also the candidate of the Catholic hierarchy of the Philippines. As in every election since the early 1920’s, that of 1965 was a contest of personalities and political “gimmickry”. Many Filipinos, particularly the hangers-on and the opportunists, take politics seriously not because they are politically sophisticated, but because they find in it a means of livelihood in the form of money received from the candidates and the promise of jobs — lucrative or menial, depending upon one’s capacity - - after victory at the polls. This explains the high degree of criminality during an election year: the political leaders and followers of candidates, whether for national or local positions, stake their lives on their candidates not because they love the poltticos, but because their future economic stability depends on the victory of th<ir candi¬ dates. As in the presidential election of 1957, the Catholic hier¬ archy and the in digenous Iglesia ni Kristo (Church of Chi is t) were dragged into the political cesspool. The latter was accused of openly supporting Marcos and other national and local can¬ didates, which was in violation of the Constitution which pro¬ hibits any church from in terfering with the affairs of th? State. On the other hand, the rabid Catholics were sharply divided into two camps: one supporting Macapagal and the other support¬ ing Manglapus. The confusion in the Catholic sector was com¬ pounded when Rufino Cardinal Santos, then in Rome issued a statement advising the faithful “to vote for the sure winner.’ Many construed “the sure winner” to mean Macapagal not only be¬ cause he as r\\ power, but also because the Catholic lay leader who flew to Rome to get the statement from the Cardinal was identified with Macapagal. There wa* a cry of excruciating pain 482 HISTORY OF. THE FILIPINO PEOPLE from the Manglapus camp who resented the Cardinal’s advise to the faithful. Bishop Mariano Madriaga, scrupulously avoiding the pitfalls of politics, issued a sober statement saying that the faithful should vote according to their conscience. The result of the voting on November 9, 1965, showed that Macapagal had lost the election from the first counting. It was clear from the trend of the voting that the people, as in 1961, wanted a change in the hope that a new administration would relieve them of their fears. Marcos won by a big majority. Mang¬ lapus made a very poor showing — a fact which proves the so- called Catholic votes a myth. Marcos Program.—On January 24, 1966, President Marcos addressed the joint session of Congress and promptly admitted that the country was in a crisis. “Today,” he said, “I come to Congress as a partner in a great enterprise.” Forthwith, he painted a very dismal picture of society and the economy. The daily in come of the government was P 4 million, while its expenditure was P 6 million, the cash daily deficit of a cool P 2 million. At the end of 1965, the cash position of the government stood at minus P 228 million. The government-owned bank itself, the Philippine National Bank, was nearly bankrupt: its unpaid loans to govern¬ ment corporations amounted to more than P 400 million, while the Development Bank of the Philippines, which usually earned millions in profits, lost more than P 5 million in 1965. The inci¬ dence of crimes, on the other hand, was on the upsurge. “The crime clock,” Marcos admitted candidly, “in dicates murder and homicide every hour, theft every 30 minutes, robbery every hour, sexual of fenses, estafa and falsification every two hours.” Pend¬ ing cases in courts numbered 80,000. Such an ugly picture of the country’s social and economic conditions made Marcos’ posi¬ tion unenviable. Facing the serious problems squarely, Marcos outlined his objectives: 1. Self-sufficiency in the production of rice and the diversifica¬ tion of crops; 2. Implementation of the land reform program; and 3. Intensification of the community development program in or der to “strengthen further our social, economic and political base.” To at tain these objectives, Marcos proposed the enactment THE CONTINUING CRISIS 483 N of laws to: 1.

The Vietnam Aid Law.—The most acrimonious controversy that arose during the first year and a half of Marcos’ adminis¬ tration was his decision to send a military engineering battalion, with armed support, to the war in Vietnam in which the United States has been deeply in volved. Many of Marcos’ sympathizers and political supporters during the presidential election of 1965 criticized him for changing his stand. Late in 1964 and in 1965, Marcos, then Senate President, opposed the Macapagal-sponsored bill providing for the sending of a military engineering battalion to the war in Vietnam. Said presidential candidate Marcos. History shows that every nation that fell to communism owed its defeat not to for eign in vasion but to disintegration from within through the failure of its leadership and its in stitutions. The sending of combat troops will commit our country to war with out regard for the provision of our Constitution for a declara¬ tion of war, and in the face of the express mandate in which we renounce war as an in strument of national policy. What South Viet Nam needs is the will to fight, which cannot be exported. It {Philippine-American friendship] will be served to day and in the future by Filipino leaders who act with becoming dignity and maturity as well as true good will to ward America, rather than those who miss no chance to yelp their loyalty and manifest a canine devotion which only results in embarrassing America no less than the Philippines before the whole world. The House of Representatives in 1965 was then controlled by the Liberal Party, which voted hastily for the Vietnam Aid Bill. In the Senate, which was controlled by the Nacionalistas, the bill died a natural death. When, the refore, Marcos, so soon after his in auguration as President, reversed his previous stand, the knowledgeable among the people suspected that Marcos had been persuaded by the American Government to change 484 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE his stand by dangling before him massive financial aid. There were severe criticisms of Marcos’ aboutface, more particularly those written by the editors of the prestigious week¬ lies Philippines Free Press and Graphic. In particular, the editor of the Free Press, Teodoro M. Locsin, appeared before Congress and ridiculed the arguments put for ward by the pro-Vietnam Aid Bill. In brief, the main arguments of the “antis” were based on the following: (1) the Constitution renounces war as an in stru¬ ment of national policy, and so the sending of a military con¬ tingent to South Vietnam was tantamount to an act of war; (2) the country was, and is still, too poor to waste P 35,000,000 a year to support the battalion to be sent to South Vietnam; (3) the money could be better spent in constructing irrigation systems to in crease the rice yield and in constructing school houses and roads; (4) the war in South Vietnam was, and is still, an American war and that the Philippines had and has, no business meddling in the in ternal affairs of another country; and (5) the United States wanted the Philippines to join the war in or der to show the world that the war in Vietnam was and still is not a racial war (the white American waging a relentless war against the colored Vietnam people), but a war for the preservation of democracy in Southeast Asia; hence the entry of the Philippines m the war. The “pros” had only one argument, namely, that the Philippines should help extinguish the communist fire in a neighboring country before it reached the Philippines. The newspapers and magazines called the pros “Hawks” and the antis “Doves.” Marcos knew the persuasive powers of his of fice and used them to advantage. He conferred with the “Doves” who in stantly became “Hawks.” The public ex¬ pectation that the “Doves” in the Senate would have their way became an illusion: with few exceptions,4 the “Doves” suddenly became “Hawks.” On July 14, 1966, Marcos signed the bill into law. The Philippines is now a participant in Johnson’s Vietnam “war.” Deterioration of Peace and Order.—The condition of peace and or der which all previous administrations failed to solve satisfactorily worsened during the first two years of the Marcos administration.

The low morale of even the agents of the law and the lamen¬ table peace and or der condition were demonstrated with clarity by the occurrence of two massacres. The lirst was the Cula- tingan massacre which happened in the barrio of Culatingan, Con¬ cepcion, Tarlac. In the early morning hours of June 13,1966, three Philippine Constabulary operations, posing as Huks, persuaded seven farmers of Culatingan to give them food and to accompany them to a certain place allegedly to liquidate an anti-Huk in¬ for mer. On the way to Culatingan, the three operative* fired their carbines at the backs of the seven farmers. Five were riddled with bullets, while two miraculously escaped to recount the story of the bloody massacre. The Constabulary, in a press release, justified the massacre by saying that the farmers were Huks who fought a running battle with the operatives. The Governor, of the province, the barrio captain of Culatingan, and the vice¬ mayor of Concepcion, swore that the massacred men were peace¬ ful farmers and that some of them fought against the Huks in 1949. On the recommendation of National Defense of ficials, President Marcos or dered the promotion of the operatives. A wave of public in dignation followed, and the Philippines Free Press, always courageous, and the Weekly Graphic, owned by a Nacionalists stalwart, sent their staff writers to the scene of the mas¬ sacre to look into the in cident, acting and studying the massacre in dependently, the newspapermen and a lady writer conclu¬ ded that the massacre was unjustified — even assuming that the victims were Huks, which they were not. The fevered in dig¬ nation that followed the announcement of the promotion in rank of the Constabulary operatives led the Defense Depart¬ ment to recall the promotion. 486 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The Culatingan massacre was similar to the Maliwalu and the Masico massacres perpetuated by government agents at the height of the Huk rebellion in the late 1940’s and the early 1950’s, Many thinking people, especially among the liberal in tellectuals, believed that the government must first show respect for the people’s civil liberties before it could expect respect from the people. This line of thinking was ably expressed by Tarlac Governor Benigno Aquino, Jr. when he said, apropos the Cula¬ tingan massacre: “Let the government show it cares about the farmer and he will care about his government, will pick up that gun and fight off the subversive.”5 The second massacre occurred very early in the morning of May 21, 1967, when thirty-two bolo-wielding fanatical mem¬ bers of the Lapiang Malaya (Free Party) and a Constabulary ranger were killed in a clash near the border of Manila and Pasay City. The Lapiang Malaya leader, eighty-three-year old Valentin de los Santos, was ment ally sick, according to a government psychiatrist. The mowing down of the Lapiang Malaya followers with Garands and Armalites drew the condemnation of the public, particularly because the agents of the law, who knew of the Lapiang Malaya's in tention to march to Malakanyang to demand the resignation of President Marcos, did not do anything to disarm the fanatics before they could charge against the well- armed Constabulary. The two massacres underscored the failure, or refusal, of the government to understand the economic and social causes of mass discontent. That a ment ally sick man like the old Lapiang Malaya leader could command the respect and loyalty of thousands of men and women from different provinces of the Philippines, show the extent of the government’s failure to provide the poor, and especially the illiterate people, with freedom from fear and hunger. Marcos’ answer to the Huk resurgence was a combination of the mailed-fist policy and social and economic program geared to the rehabilitation of the Central Luzon peasants. Marcos mobilized all the agencies of the government having to do with his social program in or der to solve ultimately the problem of 5 For in dependent accounts of the Culatingan Massacre, see E. R.

Their field commanders, Alibasbas (Cesareo Mana- rang) and Sumulong (Faustino del Mundo) succeeded in recruit¬ ing followers. This phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the peasants of Central Luzon, the Huk territory, had again lost their faith and confidence in the government, many of whose agents were abusive and corrupt. Graft and corruption, carabao rustling, unsolved crimes in volving agents of the law, and above all, the critical economic and social conditions, all of which the government had not solved satisfactorily, led many desperate and disillusioned peasants, and even men of means, to join the Huk movement. Even some landlords were alleged to have established friendly relations with the Huks who of fered them 6 Manila Times, August 26, 1966.

For a time, there was a government within a government in Cential Luzon, a situation brought about by the failure of the government to protect the life and pro¬ perty of peaceful and law-abiding citizens. President Marcos dis¬ covered through his agents that many of ficers and enlisted men of the Constabulary and the Army in Central Luzon had been in good terms with the Huks, and so he warned everybody, parti¬ cularly the agents of the law, against fraternizing with the Huks. He urged the town mayors of Pampanga, the traditional nerve- center <*f Hub activities since 1942, to bind the mselves into an anti-Huk league m or der to arrest the Huk resurgence. As if to challenge Marcos, the Huk ambushed and killed the president of the Anti-Huk Mayors’ League. Units of the Army and the Constabulary, numbering 1,000 well-armed men, ran after the alleged leader of the Huks and machine-gunned the house where Commander Delio was supposed to be hiding in the town of Candaba. All that this show of force accomplished was the killing of a pig — Commander Delio having escaped with out the knowledge of the 1,000 Constabulary and Army men who surrounded and machine-gunned the house. What gave the Huks the courage to roam freely in Central Luzon, particularly in Pampanga and Tarlac, was politics. During the political campaign of 1965, Constabulary and Army of ficers & Rationed in Pampanga and Tarlac were alleged to have established liaison with ino Huks under Commander Alibasbas for the purpose of enlisting the latter s help in campaigning for the re-election of then President Macapagal. After the latter’s defeat, Commander Alibasoas was murdered allegedly by his own men. Knowledge¬ able sources, however, believed that Alibasbas was murdered on or ders of the Constabulary of ficers in or der to prevent him from exposing the for mer’s politicking. The Congress, aware of the explosive situation in Central Luzon, particularly the alleged gathering strength of the Huk movement, sent its Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, headed by Senator Manuel Manahan, to the Huk territory to study the causes of the so-called dissidence and the efficacy of President Marcos’ development program. After two months of in tensive study, the Manahan Committee concluded that 1. The Central Luzon Development Program does not have its own financing.

Thus, significant projects started by the CLDP may be discon¬ tinued by succeeding administrations. Marcos’ development program for Central Luzon, although imbued with good in tentions, did not appreciably change the pitiable condition of the rural folk for the better. It woiild take time and more money and, more importantly, sincerity and bold execution of the social and economic plans, even to the extent of antagonizing the landlords, to make the CLDP or its equivalent a success. The Manila “Summit.”—In September 1966, President and M**« Ferdinand Marcos went to the United States for a state visit, “not to beg,” the President was careful to explain. With the exception of Magsaysay, all post-war Filipino presidents, from Roxas to Marcos, Lave made it a point to get in vited to the United States to make a pilgrimage to that country. Consequent¬ ly, during the absence of any of the presidents, the local problems, which cried out loud for immediate solutions, were swept under the rug. At the military airport, outside Washington, D. C., Marcos and company were met by a mere underling of the U. S. State Department, a fact that led many Filipino in tellectuals, especially the newspapermen, to criticize bitterly this shabby American treatment of the Filipino President. Nevertheless, the succeeding social whirls were, if the American and Filipino reporters were to be believed, “a howling success.” On September 27, while in Honolulu on the way to Japan, Marcos announced a meeting of a “Summit” in Manila in or der to help solve the Vietnam problem, that is, to end the terrible bloodletting in Vietnam in which the United States, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, had been warring against at least two-thirds of the helpless and poverty-stricken Vietnamese people who, since 1945, had not known peace"

I’d rather 7“Check and Balance,” the daily column of Amando E. Doronila in the Daily Mirror, October 27, 1966. But see also Napoleon G.

It is provoc¬ at ive.”8 The “Summit” issued three documents: (1) a joint com¬ munique; (2) a declaration on peace and progress in Asia and the Pacific; and (3) the goals of freedom. The joint communique was a resume of the discussions — minus the arrogant words of Johnson -- of the seven nations, with emphasis on conditions in South Vietnam, economic stability and progress, political evolution, the search for peace, cessation of aggression, and continuing consultation among the participating nations. The declaration on peace and progress may be described as ideals devoutly to be wished: namely, “(1) aggression must not succeed; (2) we must break the bonds of poverty, illiteracy, arid disease; (3) we must strengthen economic, social, and cultural cooperation within the Asian and Pacific region; and (4) we must seek recon¬ ciliation and peace throughout Asia.” The third document, “The Goals of Freedom,” contained a commitment “1. to be free from aggression; 2. to conquer hunger, illiteracy and diseases; 3. to build a region of security, or der, and progress; 4. to seek reconciliation and peace throughout Asia and the Pacific.” Those “goals” are, clearly, a repetition of the second document. But this conspectus of ideals, though desirable, can only be achieved through hard work, self-reliance, honesty, and in tegrity of the rulers and peoples of Asia. No amount of money poured by the United States into any underdeveloped Asian nation can make it progressive, if those who rule are corrupt, in ept, unprincipled, opportunistic, and greedy. The habit of mendicancy can never lead to economic progress. Unless the peoples of Asia help them¬ selves and revise their traditional habits and in stitutions which are in imical to progress, they will for ever remain menials in their own countries. Unless these conditions are met, the “Manila Summit” of 1966 will go down in history as a mere social gather¬ ing of like-minded nations of Asia whose opinions were shape for them by the President of the United States. In justice to President Marcos, it must be said that he tried his best to tone drwn the warlike posture of the first draft of the communique and succeeded in in serting a phrase in section 3, 8 Napoleon G.

[Italics supplied.] It was he who in sisted in in serting the phrase “and all other efforts,” which, in the context, means not military but social and economic aid to South Vietnam. He was also responsible for the in sertion in the communique of the assertion that any Philippine effort to in crease her aid to South Vietnam shall be subject to constitutional and congressional action. But section 4 of the communique, while posing to be a dec¬ laration of peaceful in tentions, was clearly a belligerent stance of the “summiteers.” It says: At the same time our united purpose is peace - peace in South Vietnam and in the rest of Asia and ihe Pacific. Our common com¬ mitment is to the defense of the South Vietnamese people. Our sole demand on +he leaders of North Vietnam is that they abandon their aggression * * * [Italics supplied.] Obviously, the “summiteers” were trying with difficulty to convince the mselves that the North Vietnamese were the real aggressors, conveniently for getting that they, under the leader¬ ship of the United States, were the real aggressors since they were on Vietnamese soil fighting with and for the United States and not for all the Vietnamese people. Hence their “demand” that the North Vietnamese surrender first before the “summit¬ eers” would talk peace in Vietnam. Furthermore, the state¬ ment that the seven-nation “summiteers” would continue “mili¬ tary and all other efforts... until the aggression is ended” was, to say the least, undiplomatic since the North Vietnamese con¬ sidered and still consider the “summiteers” as in terlopers and the refore guilty of gross in terference in the in ternal affairs of the Vietnamese people. It must be added that the terms “North Vietnam” and “South Vietnam” are artificial and temporary, as expressly provided in the Geneva Agreement of 1954, the dividing line between the two sectors (NOT states) being the 17 th parallel. Also provided for in the Geneva Agreement was an election in Vietnam in 1956 in or der to allow the Vietnamese 494 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE people to exercise the right of self-determination. The United States propped up Ngo Diiih Diem, a well-meaning but never¬ the less an in to lerant, reactionary, and in effectual despot. He antagonized the Vietnamese people, especially the Viet Cong. The U. S continued to prop up Ngo Dinh Diem until, finding him useless for her purpose, he was to ppled from his pedestal and assassinated allegedly with the knowledge, if not upon the in stigation, of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).9 No election was held in Vietnam in 1956 owing mainly to Amer¬ ican in tervention. Former U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower candidly admitted that had there been an election, the com¬ munists under Ho Chi Minh would have won hands down. Hence the American in tervention in Vietnamese affairs.

The Johnson administration was severely castigated for its Messianic delusion by no less than the American pundit, Walter Lippman. He said: We have, quite certainly, a great historic mission to perform in the Pacific and in Asia. But it cannot be performed by in vading the continent of Asia, and it is preposterous to think that we can regulate and determine the course of the revolutionary upheaval through which the people of Asia are fated to pass. Our task is to co-exist peaceably and helpfully with them while they find their way. [Italics supplied]. But we can coexist peaceably only if we forgo the messianic megalomania which is the Manila madness [the Manila “Summit”]. 9 For candid and frank expositions and exposes of the CIA’s notoriety, see Da\\! d Wise and Thomas B.

THE CONTINUING CRISIS 495 The October 24 Anti-“Summit” Demonstration.--While meticulous preparations for the “Summit” were being made, in¬ cluding the sprucing up of Manila which is like a beautiful woman with dirty face and feet, preparations against it were also being plotted by the students of Manila and the suburbs under the leadership of those enrolled at the University of the Philippines and the Lyceum of the Philippines. Teach-ins on tbs Vietnam war were conducted at the two universities in or der to acquaint everybody in terested in the subject with its manifold aspects. In the late afternoon of October 24, 1966, no less than 3,000 students and members of the nationalistic Kabataang Makabayan 1 0 staged a protest demonstration before the American Embassy and, later, in front of the plush Manila Hotel, where President Lyndon B. Johnson was billeted. The police for ces of Manila and Quezon City, to gether with a riot squad, readied the mselves against the peaceful and unarmed students. Those police for ces allegedly received “advice” from American security agents. In Quezon City, near the boundary of Manila, the Quezon City policemen stopped eighteen buses loaded with U. P. students to prevent them from joining the other students already at the Agrifina Circle in Manila.* 11 Another seventeen “jeepneys” loaded with demonstrators from a southern province were detained and harassed by the Philippine Constabulary. In front of the Amer¬ ican Embassy, an American photographer, thinking that he was in a colored town in the Southern United States, provoked the peaceful, though noisy demonstrators, by shoving his camera against their faces. On the other hand, the policemen, whom the demonstrators charged with obeying a superior or der, re¬ moved their name plates to prevent identification, and began brutalizing the peaceful and unarmed students by beating them up. One policeman used his gun and shot a demonstrator. The demonstrators carried placards saying “Johnson, Go Home,” “Yank-ky, go home,” “Shoot now, talk later — LBJ” “Viet- 10 Composed of students from different universities, colleges, and high schools throughout Manila and its suburbs.

But the unreliable in telligence agencies have no foolproof evidence against any of those ment ioned which could stand in court. 11 “Agrifina” is a portmanteau word: “Agri” from the building hous¬ ing the Department of Agriculture, and “Fina” from the building housing the Department of Finance. The two buildings are near each other and between them is a “circle” with a beautiful fountain. i 496 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE nam: Daigdig na mga Apt” (Vietnam: The World of the Op¬ pressed), and “Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill to¬ day?” The policemen lost their temper when the students shouted that President Marcos and General Ricardo Papa, Manila’s Chief of Police, were puppets. They used their truncheons mercilessly against the demonstrators, among whom were some professors.12 In the so-called riot, some female demonstrators lost their shoes, while others, male and female, sported bleeding faces. Undaunted, the demonstrators sang the Philippine National Anthem, thus for cing the police to stand stiffly at at tention. After singing of the National Anthem, the student demonstrators sang the popular Tagalog song “Dahil Sa Iyo” (Because of You). The singing of this song was followed by “Dollars sa Iyo,” a satirical parody of “Dahil Sa Iyo”. The nerves of the policemen snapped and they resumed beating up the unarmed demonstrators. The demonstrators and the decent people, in cluding many newspapermen, denounced the abuses and brutality of the police. The latter reacted by filing charges against forty-one students for breach of peace and assault.13 Public opinion was scandalized, and newspaper columnists, the liberated professors, and even simple men and women in the streets and markets, denounced police behavior.

Marcos, realizing that the situation might get out of 12 Some Americans studying in the University of the Philippines issued and published an open letter to Johnson deploring American military in ter¬ vention in Vietnam. Some of them also joined the demonstration. But according to some leaders of the demonstration from the University of the Philippines, some of the Americans who joined the demonstration were allegedly agent provocateurs. In other words, spies of their government. 13 A pro-“summit” demonstration was also held with the help of some authorities in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The pro-“Summit” demonstration had very much less participants — government employees, especially froir +he Armed Forces — than the anti-“Summit” demonstra¬ tion which, in essence, was an antj-Johnson demonstration. The preliminary Congressional in vestigation of the whys and wherefores of the pre*“Summit demonstration palpably showed that it was a fraud. But, as usual with most Congressional in vestigation, nothing came out of it. The whitewash is a very popular in gredient in practically all in vestigations conducted by the government.

But the professional witch-hunters and anti-communists in the Philippines, in or der to draw away the at tention of the public from police brutality, branded the teach-ins and the anti- “Summit” demonstrators communists or communist-in spired. This discredited stance of the professional anti-communists was directly against the liberal at titude of President Marcos who lifted the ban against going or travelling to communist countries,14 as a consequence of which many newspapermen, students, and even legislators penetrated the so-called “Bamboo Curtain” and returned to the Philippines raving over the Red Chinese progress through self-help and hard work.15 The significance of the aiiti-“Summit” demonstration lies in the fact that the students, for merly maligned during the early 1950’s for their in difference to national questions, have finally become aggressive and have become aware that it is part of their duty, as future leaders of the Philippines, to in volve the mselves in national questions. It may be observed that student demonstra¬ tions since the second half of the 1950’s have been mostly “anti- American,” that is to say, that they have not been against the American people, but against the un-American principles of the American government in its relations with the Philippines 16 and, more specifically, against the abuses of some American military personnel in their bases scattered throughout the Philippines. 14 President Marcos* lifting of the ban against travelling to communist countries, esp^rially China, is more statesmanlike and realistic than the posture of his Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Narciso Ramos, who was a long¬ time ambassador to Taipei. At one time when the question of directly importing rice from China was being discussed, Secretary Ramos said with some irritation: “I woulu rather eat camotes (sweet potatoes) than eat rice from Red China.** Secretary Ramos may have thought that he was patriotic in making such statement because he could eat the best food in the world, especially Taiwan Chinese food, but to the hungry masses his statement was not only uncalled for but also an in sult to th. suffering: ~ople. 15 The senior author has always maintained that lae salvation of the Philippines lies in self-help, hard work, and seriousness of purpose of the Filipino people and their leaders. He is against the Filipino habit of always running to Uncle Sam to ask for dollars. The Filipinos are to be blamed for the U. S.’s condescending at titude to ward them. Even in the field of scholarship to the U. S. many Filipinos act like despicable slaves in or der to get a scholarship to the U. S., If many Americans despise such kind of Fili¬ pinos, nobody is to blame but the latter. A man or woman with a slave complex does not deserve any respect or consideration. 16 See Chapter 29 for a discussion of Filipino-American tension. 493 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The Witch-Hunt.—The millitant student demonstration of October 24 led the in telligence agencies and Congress to conduct so-called in vestigations.

The students who appeared in good faith at the Congressional hearings were shouted at, in sulted, bamboozled, and accused of being subversives by some over-enthusiastic and narrow-minded congressmen. The National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), the highest in telligence agency in the country, utilized the services of dis¬ credited professional anti-communists to libel the student de¬ monstrators and some thirty or forty university professors, most of whom were from the U. P. and the Lyceum, by calling them “Reds”. A frail student, amazed at the belligerent behavior of some congressional probers, could not help exclaiming the harm¬ less and common “Abd!” (Oh!) and found himself being beaten up by a security guard of the Congressional Committee.17 The militant Kabataang Makabayan became the target of the ire of some Congressional probers and in telligence agencies, for the association represented Filipino nationalism that derived in spiration from the plebeian Andres Bonifacio, the founder of the revolutionary Katipunan of 1896, General Antonio Luna, and Apolinario Mabini, the “Brains of the Revolution,” all of whom were anti-imperialists. The members of the KM and some 17 Some newspapers representing vested in terests twisted the in cident and made it appear that the student disturbed the Congressional “hear¬ ings”. Actually, it was the guard whose misplaced enthusiasm led him to beat up the thin student whose quiet exclamation of surprise at some Congressmen’s boorishness and lack of good manners did not appeal to the guard’s animal in stincts. Two of the congressmen apologised to the student for the guard’s jungle behavior, which really caused the commo¬ tion in the room where the “hearings” were being conducted. For an ac¬ count of this in cident, see Philippines Free Press, November 3, 1966. The present author also in terviewed the student witnesses, especially the thin student beaten up by the guard. THE CONTINUING CRISIS 499 professors with a historical sense believed, rightly or wrongly, that the witch-hunt was an at tempt of the anti-nationalist elements in Filipino society, acting under alien or ders, to arrest the growth of the nationalist movement in or der to humor the importunities of alien powers. Consequently, they believed that it was the brusque and anti-nationalist congressmen, the in telligence agencies and their professional witnesses who should be in vestigated for serving allegedly alien in terests, particularly, it was alleged, their links with the notorious CIA. When the in telligence agencies and their paid witnesses, who, as Filipinos, are supposed to uphold and protect the na¬ tion al in terest*! above those of any other country and who are expected to respect the civil liberties of the people, make un¬ founded and unproved accusations which cannot stand in court, and when they resort to character assassination through trial by publicity, then, Filipino society has in deed returned to the Dark Ages when burning at the stakes of alleged witches was the rule. So dangerous is this kind of thinking of the in telligence agencies and some legislators that even Supreme Court Justice Jesus G. Barrera, the mild spoken but brilliant and liberal jurist, in his speech ‘ Nationalism and Civil Liberties,” delivered at the second anniversary of the founding of the Kabataang Makabayan, held on November 30, 1966, was compelled to issue the warning that the curtailment of the militant youth movement “might result in an uncontrollable overflowing that would sweep us all in its angry rush.” He added: It seems to me that the ultimate goal of nationalism is the freedom and ability of one nation to determine by itself its own destiny and for mulate for itself its own national policies. Any nation that seeks protection from or permits in tervention by another nation in the conduct of its domestic or for eign affairs cannot be said to be truly in dependent, irrespective of its political status. In a situation such as this, the struggle for nationalism in the protected or in tervened state at tains top priority. The in telligence agencies, however, tried to salvage their tattered image by connecting the October 24 demonstration with the youth association in China which extended an in vitation to some sixty students and a few professors of the U. P. to visit China, all expenses paid. This squid tactics was exposed by the Chairman of the U. P. Student Council, who said that the Red Chinese in vitation was extended after the U. P. Student Council had already decided to stage the now famous October 24 de- 500 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE monstration, and that the president of the U. P. and the Sec¬ retary of Foreign Affairs had then no objection to the students’ and the professors’ plan to go to China. After the now famous October 24 demonstration, the U. P. president to ssed the res¬ ponsibility to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs who or dered his subordinates not to issue any passport to any of the students and professors contemplating to go to China owing, he said, to the immaturity of the students. To the students, by Marcos, was the result of the October 24 demonstration. “If there is any Bamboo Curtain,” said the Chairman of the KM, “it is in the Foreign Office.” So scandalous had the congressional in vestigations of the students become that a newspaper columnir*, who is as “com¬ munistic” as the NICA, said in his Manila Times column of December 4,1966: The in vestigation into the student demonstrations had shown the need for this [the in vestigation of the nature of congressional in vestigations!, because the hearings which started wiui an effort to look into the demonstrations and charges of police brutality had apparently ended up as a search for subversives by very jumpy congressmen.

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY ik 27 The destruction of the national economy as a result of the war posed serious problems of subsistence and of peace and or der. In such circumstances the leaders of the nation could only rely on the United States for financial and other material aid. The hundreds of millions of dollars given to the Philip¬ pines by the United States in the form of cash and surplus property were used to rehabilitate agriculture, commerce, trade, and in dustry. Some of it, however, went to the pockets of dis¬ honest of ficials. There were marked in creases in the gross national output and in come, but the cost of living, as a whole, continues to soar or, at least, to remain static on the basis of the im¬ mediate post-liberation years. At the same time, labor grew and continues to grow, demanding in creases in wages and better living conditions. The to tal picture of the national economy has improved, but the improvements are not sufficient to bring down the cost of living, which has remained one of the highest in the world. Agricultural Production -The destruction caused by the last war told heavily on the productive capacity of the people and their standard of living. With financial help from the United States, however, the government, in the first ten years of the Republic, had succeeded in at least partially solving the minor economic problems. Thus, for in stance, crop production from 1946 to 1956 in creased from 3,507,200 metric tons to almost double the amount of 6,274,900 metric tons. This in creased production was the upshot of the expanded area planted to food crops and the application of improved means of in creasing the yield per hectare, such as the use of fertilizer, irrigation, the use of better seeds, and the effective use of chemicals against plant pests and diseases. Production of export crops also in¬ creased tremendously from 315,500 metric tons in 1946 to 2,770,000 in 1956, with copra and sugar leading all export crops. Other export crops like abaca, to bacco and their by-products have not so far completely recovered from the effects of the last war. In other sectors of the agricultural economy there has been partial recovery. Fish production in creased from 96,000 metric 502 THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 503 tons in 1946 to 388,800 metric tons in 1956, resulting in re¬ duced fish importation, which amounted in 1946-1950 to 36,540 metric tons and to 31,690 metric tons in 1951-1954. Livestock and poultry, too, registered significant improvement which led to an in crease in meat supply. The livestock population, which numbered 3,596,200 in 1946, in creased to 10,297,600 in 1956, and that of poultry from 7,516,000 to 49,632,600 in the same period. The post-war demands of rehabilitation and reconstruction also led to in creased activity in the lumber and timber in dustry. In 1946 timber and lumber production amounted to only 91 million board feet and 29 million board feet, respectively. These numbers soared in 1964 to 2,530,582,711 board feet of pro¬ duction was the outcome of local and for eign demands, thus making the timber and lumber in dustry the third biggest in dustry in the Philippines to day.

Fish production in creased from 96,000 metric 502 THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 503 tons in 1946 to 388,800 metric tons in 1956, resulting in re¬ duced fish importation, which amounted in 1946-1950 to 36,540 metric tons and to 31,690 metric tons in 1951-1954. Livestock and poultry, too, registered significant improvement which led to an in crease in meat supply. The livestock population, which numbered 3,596,200 in 1946, in creased to 10,297,600 in 1956, and that of poultry from 7,516,000 to 49,632,600 in the same period. The post-war demands of rehabilitation and reconstruction also led to in creased activity in the lumber and timber in dustry. In 1946 timber and lumber production amounted to only 91 million board feet and 29 million board feet, respectively. These numbers soared in 1964 to 2,530,582,711 board feet of pro¬ duction was the outcome of local and for eign demands, thus making the timber and lumber in dustry the third biggest in dustry in the Philippines to day. Domestic Trade. -Added to the grave economic problems resulting from the war, the economy also suffered from alien control of the domestic trade* It was to lessen this alien hold on domestic trade that the government passed remedial measures. These measures, known as nationalization laws, in cluded the Market Stalls Act (1946), which provides that citizens of the Philippines “shall have preference in the lease of public market stalls”; the Retail Trade Nationalization Law (1954), which provides that no person, partnership, association, or capital which is not wholly owned by Filipino citizens shall engage in the retail trade; the Filipino Retailers’ Fund Act (1955), which provides that credit facilities be extended to Filipino retailers; the NAMARCO Act (1955), which provides for the establish¬ ment of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), a government corporation charged with assisting Filipino retailers and busmessmen by supplying them with goods at prices that would enable them to compete in the open market. These laws, and scores of other nationalization laws dealing with natural resources, public utilities, trade, commerce, and in dustry, are meant to loosen the stranglehold of aliens in domestic trade. The Philippines is probably the only country where for eigners enjoy a great advantage in business matters over the Filipinos. With the passage of the various nationalization laws, the opening of new roads, the improvements in public utilities, and the ex¬ tension of credit facilities to Filipino retailers and merchants, domestic trade is gradually placed in the hands of Filipinos. 504 HISTORY or f HE EILIPINO PEOPLE The only stumbling block in the realization of this program is the altitude of some Filipinos in allowing the mselves to be dummies of aliens. The Anti-Dummy Board, however, is exert¬ ing its efforts to bring to court those guilty of acting as dummies for alien capitalists, but their efforts so far have netted but a slight number of those charged and punished for violating the Anti- Dummy Law Foreign Tirade and Commerce/The first effect of the war on the national economy can easily be seen in the predominance of imports over exports, the main characteristic of the post-war for eign trade of the Philippines. This characteristic is best reflect¬ ed in the unfavorable balance of trade during the ten-year period from 1946 to 1955, which amounted to P 2,877,531,744. The highest imbalance in for eign trade was recorded in 1949 when the unfavorable balance amounted to P 625,686,000. This alarm¬ ing spectacle led the government to in stitute radical reforms to arrest or at least lessen the unfavorable impact of trade imbalances on the national economy. One of the most important of these reforms was the system of import and exchange controls which became operative in 1949 or 195 C. The imbalance registered daring the ten-year period, 1946-1955, was accompanied by the falling prices of major export crops such as abaca, sugar, and copra. The to tal for eign trade of the Philippines during the period under study amounted to P 15,732,488,123, of which about 70% constituted trade with the United States. Mineral Production.- The extensive mineral wealth of the country has not been fully exploited owing principally to the lack of sufficient Filipino capital. This mineral wealth can be gleaned from the report of the Bureau of Mines in 1956: 15 million tons of gold and silver reserves worth P 250,000,000; 1.2 billion tons of iron ores worth PI 2,000,000,000, 22 million tons of copper worth P 320,000,000; 10 million tons of chrome ores worth P 270,000,000; 0.2 million tons of manganese worth PI 2,000,000; 12 million tons of coal worth P 180,000,000; and 60 million tons of other minerals and non-metals worth P 738,000,-000. Production from 1946 to 1956 showed great improvements. In 1946, owing mainly to the destruction of machinery and mining to ols, the to tal mineral production, which in cluded gold, silver, base metal and non-metals, was valued at P 3,997,035. This amount in creased to P 196,710,488 in 1956. THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 505 The Bell Mission Report.' Despite efforts to rehabilitate agriculture, in dustry and trade, the national economy continued to be anaemic. In desperation, President Quirino requested Pres¬ ident Harry S.

Consequently, Pres¬ ident Truman appointed Daniel W.

The basic economic problem in the Philippines is inef¬ ficient production and very low in comes. 2. The finances of the Government had become steadily worse and were not critical.

In the meantime, the volume of exports was less than before the war and could be expected to grow only gradually. The Bell Report summed up the causes of these economic difficulties as follows: 1. Up to 1950, so little had been done to in crease productive efficiency and to diversify the national economy; 2. There had been great in equalities in the level of in come of the people. While the standard of living of a great segment of the population remained below that of the pre-war level, the profits of businessmen and large landowners had risen consider¬ ably. Under the circumstances, the continued rise in the prices of commodities tended to transfer real in come from the poor - to the wealthy; and 1 Not to be confused with C. Jasper Bell, author of the Bell Trade Act of 1946. 2 For excerpts of the Bell Report, see Reading 28.1 at the end of the Chapter. i 506 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 3. Inefficiency and corruption in the government led the people to lose their faith and confidence in the ability of the government to “protect the in terests of all the people.” The result was demoralization of the people. To solve these problems, the Bell Mission recommended thai: 1. To avoid further in flation or undue in crease in currency, the finances of the government should be placed on a jound basis by - (a) imposing additional taxes in an equitable manner in or der to meet the expenses of the government; (b) revising the tax structure in such a way that a good pro¬ portion of the taxes could be collected from those having big in¬ comes and large property holdings; (c) revamping the tax collecting machinery in or der to secure greater efficiency in the collection of taxes; (d) encouraging in vestment in productive enterprises; and (e) coordinating the fiscal, credit, and in vestment policy of the government to prevent the recurrence of in flation, 2. The improvement of agricultural production by in creas¬ ing the yield of basic crops through modem and efficient meth¬ ods, giving sufficient funds to agricultural extension stations in or der to expand their services; establishment of rural banks in or der to provide credit to the small farmers; and providing the tenants with “reasonable security on their land and equit¬ able share of the crops they produce.” 3. To diversify the economy by — (a) encouraging new in dustries; ' (b) developing power and transportation facilities needed for the development of the national economy; (c) coordinating the activities of all government corporations and abolishing those that had proved in effective; (d) giving financial assistance to productive enterprises. 4. To reduce undue demands for imports, a special emer¬ gency tax of 25% be levied, for a period not lasting more than two years, on imports, except rice, com, flour, canned fish and milk, and fertilizer. 5. To undertake an adequate program of public health and education and to provide better facilities for urban housing; to pass laws for the protection of the workers in their right to or gan¬ ize free trade unions and to work freely for their economic well¬ being; and to establish a minimum wage for urban and agricul- THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 507 tural workers in or der to provide them with subsistence standards of living. 6. To improve public administration in such a way as to in sure honesty and efficiency in the government. 7. American financial assistance of $250 million through grants arid loans to help carry out the five-year program of economic development and technical assistance. The government through the years, from President Quirino to President Garcia, had taken steps to implement the recom¬ mendations of the Bell Survey Mission. Some of these were the establishment of rural banks, the passage of the Magna Carta of Labor and other labor laws, the encouragement of new and necessary in dustries, the in stitution of the system of import and exchange controls and the reorganization of the govern¬ ment and the reclassification of employees and of ficials. Financial Institutions.“-The financial position of the coun¬ try before 1950 was so serious that economists and financial experts advocated the establishment of a Central Bank to en¬ sure the economic progress and financial stability of the nation and to provide a firm basis for political sovereignty. It took sometime for the government to appreciate the wisdom of such a step, for it was not until 1948 that a bill providing for the creation of the Central Bank was passed by Congress and sign¬ ed by President Quirino. The Central Bank was in augurated on January 3, 1949 and was immediately hailed as the Charter of Philippine economic sovereignty. Primarily, the function of the Central Bank is to maintain the stability of the peso. To discharge this primary function, the Central Bank was given the powers to preserve the in ternational value of the peso and its convertibility into other free currencies and to promote the rising level of production, employment, and real in come in the Philippines. To at tain these ends, the Bank was granted the monopoly of issuing currency. At the same time, it acts as financial adviser to the government. It regulates the banking system through effective supervision of all banking in stitutions in the country, their operations, and other matters necessary to stabilize the peso.

The necessity of rehabilitating and developing in dustries, agriculture, and buildings led President Manuel Roxas to re- 508 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE commend to Congress the establishment of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC, later changed to Development Bank of the Philippines.) The bill creating the corporation was pass¬ ed in 1946, but it began operations on January 2, 1947 with an authorized capital of P 300,000,000. It is charged by the law “to provide credit facilities for the rehabilitation of agriculture, commerce and in dustry, the reconstruction of property damaged by the war, and the broadening and diversification of the na¬ tion al economy.” The RFC, the refore, had two objectives: to repair the damage resulting from World War II and to under¬ take activities designed to promote the economic well-being of the country. To at tain the first objective, the RFC granted loans for the building of new factories or for the reconstruction of old ones, for the purchase of equipments and implements to replace those destroyed during the war, for the reconstruc¬ tion of damaged commercial buildings, and for the building of new houses. The reconstruction program of the RFC, on the other hand, in cluded the extension of financial assistance to pri¬ vate banks, in surance companies, and building and loan asso¬ ciations. As a result of these activities, the RFC had succeeded in putting on their feet commercial and financial houses, in dus¬ tries, agriculture, and building contractors. This program of rehabilitation and reconstruction is best seen in Manila’s new skyline: hundreds of buildings now dot the downtown areas of Manila and the suburbs. Larger and better houses have sprung up and continue to multiply in Manila and the provinces. Assistance to agriculture up to August 1955 amounted to P 34,648,693, while loans to in dustrial enterprises amounted to P 32,566,700. The to tal loans to in dustry and trade up to August 1955 amount¬ ed to P 788, l 25,868,50, distributed as follows: Luzon, P 535,661,- 963.50; Visayas, P 194,992,550.00; and Mindanao, P 57,471,355.00. The vast program of rehabilitation and reconstruction and the in stitution of import and exchange controls led, at the end of 1958, to: 1. in crease in the gross national output to P 10.5 billion, compared with P 8 billion in 1953; 2. in crease, since 1954, in agricultural production to talling 35.1%; 50.2% in mining production; and 73.7% in manufacturing; 3. a favorable balance of trade, as of June 1959, amounting to P 95.2 million; and THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 509 4. the expansion and dispersal of credit facilities to many provinces. The state of the present national economy is far from be¬ ing satisfactory, considering that poverty, stagnation, and high cost of living are still around stalking the poor and the low- in come group. However, there are in dications that the state of the nation will, with more efficiency and less graft and corrup¬ tion, improve and thus make life less exasperating. Unfavorable Features of the Economy.-The comparative rise in gross national output and national in come and the ex¬ pansion of trade and commerce fot the last ten years do not necessarily mean the healthy growth of Filipino economy. For while the gross national output and national in come may reflect growth, this growth, nevertheless, is not necessarily Filipino growth. The Census of 1948 shows that the to tal for eign as¬ sets of the country, while Filipinos owned 51.9% of the to tal assets. This means that the to tal assets were — and continue to be *- almost equally divided between Filipinos and for eigners, certainly not a flattering situation in a country where Filipinos aie supposed to control the economy. The following table clearly illustrates the point: PHILIPPINES: FOREIGN COUNTRIES: Transportation 76.1% 23.9% Forestry 51.9% 42.3% Mining 42.4% 57.6% Electricity 17.8% 82.2% Fisheries 100 % — — Commerce ' 46.1% 53.9% Manufacturing 49.1% 50.9% It is obvious that the aliens control mining, electricity, com¬ merce, and manufacturing, while Filipinos have a complete control of fisheries and a better control of for estry and transportation. The statistics show that a large portion of the to tal assets of the country is in the hands of aliens who have the power, because of their wealth, to in fluence or even to control the political and economic policies of the country. In the import trade, Filipino participation is very much less than that of the for eigners because the for mer’s capital is very much less than that of the latter. Consequently, the alien traders and businessmen in the Philippines enjoy a position of privilege which even the Filipino businessmen do not enjoy in their own country. The in crease 510 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE in the economic power of any group also in creases its political power. Consequently, the aliens in the Philippines enjoy, surrepti¬ tiously, a political power that poses a danger to the political in dependence of the country.

At first a voice in the wilderness, Senator Recto was joined by Carlos P. Garcia when the latter was catapulted to the Presidency in 1957. Garcia’s administration heralded the resurgence of Filipino nationalism. The realization that even the Central Bank discriminated against Filipino businessmen in the allocation of dollars for imports and the fact that about 70% of the domestic trade and about 80% of the for eign trade are in the hands of aliens, principally Chinese and Americans, led the Garcia Administration to enunciate of ficially the “Filipino First” policy. This was contained in Resolution No. 204 adopted by the National Economic Council (NEC) on August 21, 1958. Henceforth, Filipinos would be given preference in all matters pertaining to the economic development of the country. The political impact of the “Filipino First” policy was tre¬ mendous. The Nacionalista Party made political issue of it and its candidates to ured the barrios to explain its meaning and sig¬ nificance. The policy caught fire especially among the Filipino businessmen and the in tellectuals, and the Philippine Chamber of Commerce promptly adopted it as a slogan. The result of such a policy can be gleaned from the fact that Filipino partic¬ ipation in dollar allocation as of December 1959 jumped to 51%, meaning that Filipino businessmen might, in the near future, capture the domestic and for eign trade from the powerful aliens. If continued unabated, the “Filipino First” policy may yet lead to genuine in dustrialization, to more employment, and to the capture of the national economy by Filipinos. The alien busi¬ ness men, who have been the lords and masters of Philippine economy since time immemorial, were alarmed at the spread THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 511 of economic nationalism and through Filipino dummies, spread the rumor that the Garcia Administration was anti-alien, more particularly, anti American and anti-Chinese. They saw in the “Filipino First” policy the eventual liquidation of their dominant role as economic czars of the country which has been so to lerant of even the most unscrupulous and ruthless among the for eigners. But President Garcia, on December 27, 1959, dismissed the calculated rumor when he emphasized that the “Filipino First” policy was not in any way directed against any alien but was “a struggle for the natural right of the Filipino people to be supreme in their own country.’ The economic awakening, particularly in the Filipinos’ in¬ sistence on nationalizing the retail trade, which took effect in 1964, led to American cries of anti-Americanism and to pressures on the government to amend the law in such a way as to give American businessmen in the Philippines a decided advantage even over Filipino entrepreneurs. The American Chamber of Commerce, in particular, declared in September 1964 that “The drive behind the nationalization legislation during the past decade and more is the natural desire of the Filipinos to play a dominant part in the conduct of their in dustry and trade of the country - when it is not merely the aim, no doubt, it is of a few, to enrich the mselves by stealing from others.” The statement drew the ire of Filipino nationalists, and Senator Lorenzo Tanada, one of the for emost nationalists and considered the successor of the late Senator Claro M. Recto, denounced the American at titude in a privileged speech on the floor of the Senate. Said the senator: Are these the words of friends that Americans are supposed to be? They recognize, or claim they do, the basic merit of the nationalization movement. Yet they snipe as it — they would place the entire movement under suspicion as “the aim of a few to enrich the mselves by stealing from others.” They sneer at it as blind nationalism, proof of an in feriority complex. They take potshots at our Supreme Court, which courageously upheld nationalistic legislation as a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state, at Congress and the executive arm of our government. The crusade for Filipino dominance in the economic field is on, but it will take a truly nationalistic government adminis¬ tration to free the country from alien control.

The Filipino nationalists challenged the validity and morality of the American contention that the Laurel-Langley Agreement and “parity” give the American corporations, partnerships, and associations more rights than the Filipinos in the latter’s coun¬ try, in that those American business establishments, even if not who'ly owned and controlled by American citizens, can en¬ gage in retail trade. The Macapagal Administration, speaking through its Solicitor General who distinguished himself by be¬ ing frequently defeated in the courts of law, maintained that the Philippines had committed herself to the policy of exempt¬ ing American business firms from the operation of the Retail Trade Nationalization Law. In view of the opposing views on the matter, the Philippine Packing Corporation and other Amer¬ ican firms went to court to get a judgment. On December 16, 1966, Judge Hilarion Jarencio of the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that the Americans and their business enterprises “are prohibited by the Retail Trade National¬ ization Law from engaging in retail business.” He cited that law’s definition of “retail trade”, which in cludes “sales in limited quantities to the general public of consumer goods for personal or household consumption, but also sales for in dustrial or com¬ mercial consumption.” Said Judge Jarencio: It does not mean that the Philippines had renounced its in¬ herent right as a sovereign state to enact laws and adopt or dinances and regulations for the sole protection of Filipino citizens, and when it does so, such a law will automatically operate in favor THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 513 of American citizens, otherwise it will be open to the charge of discrimination. The judge also cited or dinances and laws in different states of the United States “restricting certain professions and busi¬ ness activities to Americans...” It is obvious, he added, that “it is of ten necessary for an in dependent nation to adopt laws and regulations to protect its citizens and limit the right to engage in certain activities to them.*’ * Judge Jarencio's decision jolted the American businessmen in the Philippines, and even those in the United States. Their fear was compounded when, the following day, December 17, the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Jesus G. Barrera, whose decision on the “parity clause” was concurred in by all the Justices, in cluding Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, de¬ fined the limits of “parity” tha* was imposed on the Philippines immediately after World War II in exchange for rehabilitation dollars. The case arose when the San Jose Petroleum, Inc., a Panamanian company doing business in the Philippines, claimed to be American owned in or der to enjoy the fruits of “parity” rights. The Supreme Court ruled that “a business enterprise, to be entitled to parity rights in the Philippines, must be owned and controlled by American citizens whose states give reciprocal rights to Filipinos.” Justice Barrera anchored his decision on the fact that the so-called American petroleum company was not 100% owned and controlled by American citizens, but by two for eign corporations. Justice Barrera himself admitted that the significance of the Supreme Court’s decision lies in the fact that “in the enjoyment of parity rights, Americans cannot have more rights than Filipinos.” The economic effects of these court rulings on the Philip¬ pine economy will be determined by later events, especially by the reaction of the American Government which will naturally protect the business in terests of its citizens and will do every¬ thing in its power to make such protection effective. The im¬ mediate effect of the Jarencio ruling was that the American business enterprises, led by the ESSO, fearing that the Supreme Court might sustain Judge Jarencio’s decision, tried to effect a compromise by appealing to President Marcos for 11 ■? latter to in tervene in the matter. When Marcos did not in tervene, the Philippine Packing Corporation appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which has not yet (1969) rendered a decision. 514 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE At any rate, the two decisions were favorably greeted almost unanimously by the people, but particularly by the nationalists who have been the consistent and vocal critics of what they have always regarded as the * American at tempts to colonize the Philip¬ pines for a second time: this second colonization being greatly advantageous to them than to the Filipinos because they, the Americans, have been enjoying economic rights and privileges in the Philippines with out the corresponding responsibility. A few voices, mostly coming from Filipino serfs who have not yet for gotten the sound of the chains of colonialism, are so pessi¬ mistic as to predict an economic dislocation if the Jarencio decision became effective and implemented. However, Manila’s Mayor Antonio J. Villegas immediately tried to implement the Retail Trade Nationalization Law and filed a case with the Supreme Coqrt to test the validity of the Marcos Administration’s contention that the Jarencio decision was not yet final and so the opinion of the Department of Justice should prevail over the decision of the Judge of Court of First Instance.

According to Section 11, Article XVII of {he Constitution of 1973, the sights and privileges* granted, to Americans under the parity provision, of the 1 1935 Constitution; as amended, shall automatically terminate on July 3, 1974., Thus, at midnight of July 3-4, 1974, the agreement expired and so the trade privi¬ leges enjoyed hy American citizens in the Philippines also expired. On the other hand, *Philippiri! e exports t 04 fhe United States, except sugaj; which*is covered by the^ Sugar Act of the United States; became subject to the full 100 per cent, tariff and other duties. In place' of the Laurel-Langley Agreement,. a treaty of commerce and amity has to be concluded to regulate the future trade relations between the two countries. To date (June, 1976), no such treaty has as yet been concluded. With the expiration of the Agreement, American business firms in the Philippines were required to yield at least 60 per THE PROHLE UP THE ECONOMY 515 cent of their holdings to Filipino citizens. Insofar, however, as. American landholdings were concerned, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued a presidential decree providing that the termi¬ nation of the American landholdings in the Philippines would take effect not simultaneously with the termination of the Laurel- Langley Agreement, but on May 17, 1975. Under the decree, American citizens or corporations owning lands in the Philippines acquired from private in dividuals are covered by the extension granted by the decree, but landholdings acquired from the Philip¬ pine Government must be disposed of at once. The Growth of Labor Unions.-The growth of labor unions in the Philippines is essentially an upshot of the American oc¬ cupation. Labor unions were unknown during the Spanish per¬ iod, for aside from the Jimited in dustrial and commercial op¬ portunities the Colonial Government did not encourage any movement that would tend to undermine the Spanish view of peace and or der... On February 2, 1902, however, mainly owing to the American in fluence and to the free access of the Filipinos to books and periodicals carrying items about labor movements in the United States and elsewhere, a group of radical and pro¬ gressive Filipinos, led by Isabelo de los Reyes, Dominador Go¬ mez, Aurelio Tolentino, Hermenegildo Cruz, Lope K. Santos and others, founded the first labor union in the Philippines, the Union Obrera Democratica de Filipinos. (Democratic Labor Union of the Philippines). With La Redencion del Obrero as its of ficial or gan, the Union voiced the social demands and na¬ tion alistic feelings of the workers, for the labor unions of the period were the projection of the nationalistic era of the Re¬ volution. Writers, who found in literature an ideal medium for communicating their nationalistic and socialistic tendencies, wrote essays, poems, and novels depicting the social conditions, the aspirations of the masses, and what they believed to be the ideal state. Most in fluential of these works, however, was Lope K. Santos’ Banaag at Sikat. Avidly read by the masses and the in tellectuals, the book in no small measure in fluenced the workers in fighting for economic, social and political re¬ forms. As a result, more and more labor unions sprouted; strikes were resorted to by the laborers, particularly those en¬ gaged in cigar and cigarette manufacture, to the discomfiture of the capitalists who had been accustomed to pushing the work¬ ers around. The labor leaders, on May 1, 1913, presented a united front when they held the first labor congress on the occasion of the celebration of the first labor day in the Philip¬ pines. 516 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE In the 1920’s communist and socialist in fluence seeped through some labor unions, particularly those of Manila and Central Luzon. Confronted with new and radical techniques, the conservative leaders like Antonio D. Paguia and Ruperto S. Cristobal opposed the communist-in spired tactics of Crisanto Evangelista, Jacinto Manahan, Antonio D. Ora, Arturo Soriano and others, and seceded from the Collective Labor Movement. They founded their own, the National Federation of Labor and the Confederated Workers’ Alliance. When, in 1939, Secretary of Labor Jose Avelino for med the National Commission on La¬ bor, both the communist and conservative factions of labor were represented. The conflict between the two labor camps continued up to the outbreak of the war, when all labor unions were declared illegal by the Japanese conquerors. After the v. ar, the growth of labor was phenomenal. The labor movement became dynamic, particularly because cf the war experiences of the masses and of the in fluence of the Amer¬ ican soldiers who were members of powerful labor unions in the United States. Of the numerous labor unions that sprang up immediately after the war, the most popular and powerful was the Commhtee (later changed to Congress) of Labor Or¬ ganization (CLO), founded and dominated by progressive la¬ bor leaders. Laborers in all sectors of the economy were or¬ ganized and strikes were used frequently to boost wages. At first headed by Cipriano Cid, a lawyer and for mer staff mem¬ ber of the Manila Daily Bulletin, the union became aggressive under the leadersnip of Amado V. Hernandez, for mer councilor of Manila, for mer editor of the daily Mabuhay and an eminent writer and poet in Tagalog. With the labor front in turmoil owing to the uncompromising stand of the CLO and with Cen¬ tral Luzon up in arms against the government, Quirino’s admin¬ istration, taking advantage of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, bore down on militant labor unions, particularly the CLO, and “in vited” its leader to Camp Murphy for in vestigation"

Hernandez was detained for six montus before charges were preferred against him. He was charged with the crime of “re¬ bellion complexed with murder and arson” and sentenced to life imprisonment. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court, Her¬ nandez was acquitted. Today (1967), in terms of number and bargaining strength, Philippine labor unions seem for midable. Up to the end of 1966, there were no less than 2,000 unions scattered all over the country THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY 517 with a strength of some 750,000 members distributed in all in dustries. Labor Gains.”-Through united action, labor made significant gains, among the first being the creation of the Bureau of Labor and, later, of the Department of Labor, and the enactment of legislation providing for the prosecution of usurers, the protection of domestic help, the payment of compensation to workers in¬ jured in line of duty, and the protection of women and children working in factories. A special tribunal, the Court of Industrial Relations, has been established to facilitate the settlement of disputes between labor and management and to help in the effective implementation of laws governing the relationship between capital and labor, such as the Eight Hour Labor Law, the Social Security Act, and others. The most significant labor legislation safeguarding the rights of labor is Republic Act No. 875, popularly known as the Magna Carta of Labor. This law encourages laborers freely to form unions and recognizes the right of labor to bargain collectively and to declare strikes. There are, however, safeguards against possible abuse of power by the labor unions. Under the Magna Carta of Labor, a union could be guilty of unfair labor practices if it in timidates or prevents laborers from joining unions of their choice, or if the union refuses to bargain collectively despite the fact that it represents the majority of the workers, or if it demands from employers payment to laborers for work not done. The Social Security Act of 1954 is another milestone in the history of Philippine labor. Under the Act, a social security fund is set up to be administered by the Social Security Com¬ mission. The fund consists of contributions from employers and laborers: 2.5% of the salaries to be contributed by the laborers and 3.5% by the employers. From these accumulated funds are taken the allowances for the sick and the unemployed mem¬ bers of the Social Security System and the retirement and dis¬ ability benefits accruing to the laborers. Two other important laws safeguard the health and eco¬ nomic well-being of the laborers. The Termination Pay Law provides that neither employer nor employee, in cases where there is no contract regarding definite period of employment in agricultural, in dustrial or commercial establishments, shall terminate the service with out due notice of at least thirty days 518 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE prior to its termination. The Blue Sunday Law gives a sem¬ blance of leisure to the laborers, for it prohibits work on Sun¬ days, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day. The Minimum Wage Law sets the floor or minimum wage at P 120.00 a month or not less than P 4.00 a day in urban areas, and P 2.00 daily in agricultural areas. The Anti-Scab Law, passed in 1963, aims at protecting the workers’ rights to strike and to picket, while another law, passed in 1965, amended the Minimum Wage Law by raising the mini¬ mum wage of P 6.00 a day. Owing to the rapid in crease of population, particularly in the urban districts where provincial workers flock, and to the minimal in dustrialization which consists mainly of packaging houses, the problem of unemployment is rather serious. At the end of 1958, about 9% or 10% of the to tal labor force of 8.5 million was unemployed. Equally serious is the low in come of the Filipino wage earners. In 1957, when the gross national in come was P 8,799 million, only 41.5% of the amount represent¬ ed wages and salaries of workers and employees. This in dex is low compared with those of other countries: 49.1% for Japan and 58.7% for Australia. The same condition exists to day (1969), but the unemployed labor force has in creased dangerously. Bad Features of Philippine Labor:— On paper, it would seem that labor is united and, the refore, strong. Actually, however, Philippine labor is divided against itself owing mainly to, first, differences in principles, and second, personal ambitions of some leaders. Mergers of union have failed in the past because of the in sistence of some labor leaders on a certain degree of autonomy from the parent or ganization, a demand that was not taken seriously by those in power. On the other hand, labor leaders seldom agree, personally and in principles, with one another. Instead of unity there is rivalry which, at times, takes the form of busting each other’s head. Labor rivalries in the water front are frequent and too scandalous to elucidate. Early in 1959, the labor unions grandiloquently announced the for¬ mation of a super-or ganization, the Kalipunan tig mga Mang- gagawang Filipino (KMP), but no sooner had President Garcia spoken to them at a banquet at the Manila Hotel than some affiliated unions with drew from the parent or ganization alleged¬ ly on a question of principle.

Some labor unions are still in fested with unscrupulous and dishonest leaders whose one preoccupation is to make “suckers” out of the laborers. These leaders or, properly misleaders, would in stigate a strike against management for the ostensible purpose of in creasing wages. After days or weeks of negotiations, the leaders, having been prevailed upon by management to accept a “gift” of, say, P 50,000, would then tell the striking laborers that the company would be in the red if they persisted in their demands for wage in creases. Would they want the company to close shop and consequently for them to lose their jobs? The naive laborers would look at one another and meekly submit to management. Another in stance of dishonesty on the part of certain labor misleaders is the so-called kickback. In this practice, the labor leaders compel the workers to “come across,” that is to say, to give a part of their daily wages to the for mer, through the capataz or for eman, who sees to it that all pay their “dues”. A com¬ plaining or reluctant laborer is promptly punished by excluding him from the next job, thus depriving him of the opportunity to earn an honest living. Collectively, the laborers, being un¬ disciplined in labor ways, in variably “come across,” the reby encouraging and perpetuating the system of exploitation. Still another dishonest practice is that in which the labor misleader hires his laborers for, say, four pesos a day. Actually management pays him six or seven pesos per laborer per day. Thus, the misleader gets between two and three pesos per la¬ borer per day. If he has, say, 500 laborers in the payroll, he earns a cool PI,000 at two pesos per laborer and PI,500 a day at three pesos per laborer. Little wonder that some labor lead¬ ers, with comparatively small salaries as heads of their labor unions, live like princes. One other bad feature of labor in the Philippines is the work¬ er’s lack of civic sense. Nurtured under a tradition of close family relations, the laborer thinks only of his family and for gets the larger issue of the class to which he belongs. A striking union fails because scabs act as strike-breakers, and they do‘so because they think in terms of their families and not of the welfare of the laboring class. Much of the failure of labor strikes in the Philippines lies in the failure of the in dividual worker to make HISTORY Of Till [ 1 LIPINO PEOPLE 5 20 temporary sacrifices in the in terest of his class. He thinks only of the here and now, of the present predicament of his family and not of its future, rnd ignores the fact that In acting thus he helps actively in perpetuating his unenviable condition. Also because of the close personal relations that characterize the worker as Filipino, he does not, in general vote for his class’ candidates for elective positions. The case of a trade union leader who ran for vice-mayor of Manila in the election of 1959 and got badly licked by a novice shows not only the political immaturity of the Filipino worker, but also his misplaced in¬ dividualism and sense of personal loyalty. He in variably votes for any candidates, no matter how reactionary, who has patted him on the back and who has given him a few pesos. The candi¬ date of his own class is the reby ignored and goes down in ignoble defeat. Press releases and eloquent speeches to the contrary not¬ with standing, Philippine labor is, on the whole, still in its swad¬ dling clothes. It will probably take? ome time for labor to get truly united and climb to a position of in fluence in the national community. ^.1. ^ ». t.

The first plank has been criticized by the nationalists for its sub¬ servience to the United States in the belief that the in terests of the Republic do not always coincide with the in terests of the United States.

According¬ ly, when President Roxas stood up to deliver his in augural address that morning of July 4, 1946, he laid down the first plank of Philippine policy: the closest cooperation with the United States “in all matters concerning our common defense and security. ” One result of the war was the partial liquidation of West¬ ern imperialism in the Orient leading to the political emancipa¬ tion of Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia and Malaya. With the emergence of these Asian states, the Philippines, as a geographic entity of Southeast Asia, became tangent to its dev¬ elopment. An in creasing awareness of the emerging political 521 5 22 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE setup led President Roxas to enunciate the second plank of Philippine for eign policy: sympathy for the political aspirations of all subject peoples, especially those of Asia, and the extension of full cooperation in any plan or effort to raise the standards of living in the neighboring countries. Earlier, when war was rushing to its conclusion, the Philip¬ pines joined the United Nations as a full-fledged member and shared, along with other nations on the side of the democracies, the hope of a universal peace and security. This sentiment was expressed by then President Sergio Osrnena and affirmed by succeeding Presidents. The third plank, the refore, of Philippine for eign policy is the full and active participation of the Philip¬ pines in the ideals and work of the United Nations. First Plank: Implementation—The first plank of Philippine for eign policy revolved around Filipino-American relations. The change from colonial status to in dependence necessitated read¬ justments in the relations between the Philippines and the United States. Consequently, the two countries entered into treaties and agreements designed to continue the close friendship that has existed between them approximately since 1902. The Philip¬ pines accepted, having then no better alternative, the Bell Trade Act and the Tydings Rehabilitation Act of 1946 in or der to proceed with the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged agriculture, in dustries, buildings, roads, bridges, and schoolhouses. Recognizing that the recent war had “confirmed the mutuality of in terest” of the Philippines and the United States “in matters relating to the defense of their respective territories,” and that measures should be taken to promote their security, the Philip¬ pines and the United States concluded, on March 14, 1947, a military agreement by which the for mer granted the latter the right to “retain the use of bases in the Philippines” for period of ninety-nine years, to permit the United States to use such bases as the latter may determine according to military necessity, and to enter into negotiations with the United States concerning the expansion of such bases. Ostensibly the military bases are designed to strengthen the American armed for ces in the Philip¬ pines in or der to enable her to protect the latter from external aggression. While this may be true, it is nevertheless true that, in a world divided between democracy and communism, those for ces are designed also to protect American in terests in Southeast Asia. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 523 i The maintenance of American bases in the Philippines was not enough to ensure the security of the country and of Amer¬ ican in terests in Asia. On March 21,1947, the Military Assistance Pact was concluded between the two countries under which the United States would furnish arms, ammunition, equipment, and supplies to the armed for ces of the Philippines. At the same time, the agreement also provided for the creation of a Military Advisory Group composed of Filipino and American personnel whose function was to “provide such advice and assistance” to the Philippines as “is necessary to accomplish the purposes” of the agreement. The pact was to last for five years. On June 26, 1953, an exchange of notes, which had the effect of a for mal agreement, extended the effectivity of the military assistance pact from July 5,1953 until terminated by either party. To show their complete unity and determination to “defend the mselves against external armed at tack,” both coimtries con¬ cluded the Mutual Defense Treaty on August 30, 1951. Among other things, the treaty provides for the settlement of in ternation¬ al disputes in which they may get in volved by peaceful means and for consultation with each other “regarding the implementa¬ tion of the treaty.” Significantly, the treaty provides that Each Party recognizes that an armed at tack in the Pacific area on either of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes. This particular provision of the treaty, while at first sight favorable to the Philippines, is actually an empty declaration, since, as pointed out by Senator Claro M. Recto, the for emost Filipino expert on for eign affairs and consistent critic of Philip¬ pine for eign policy, the agreement does not provide for an auto¬ matic declaration of war on the part of the United States against any external aggressor of the Philippines. He correctly pointed out that in case of an external aggression against the Philippines, the treaty merely provides for action “to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes, ” meaning that the United States might not come to the assistance of the Philippines if the American Congress, which has the authority to declare war, does not see fit to make such declaration"

But in September 1966, an American Embassy spokesman in Manila, in a speech before Filipino businessmen, realistically admitted, in connection with President Franklin Roosevelt’s wartime promise to the Filipinos that the United States would pay for every carabao killed dur¬ ing the war, that Roosevelt’s promise was not binding on the American Congress — an honest admission that the promise of one American President is written on water. In the face of this “confession”, the Filipino nationalists had reason to rebuke and ridicule the naive among their countrymen for pleading and re¬ peating the discredited and mythical “special relations” with the United States. On the economic front, the Philippines and the United States have concluded agreements designed to help the for mer economic¬ ally.1 The agreement of July 4, 1946, an of fshoot of the Bell Trade Act and the Tydings Rehabilitation Act, provided for the amendment of the Philippine Constitution in or der to give parity rights to the Americans. Another agreement, known the Quirino-Foster Agreement of November 14, 1950, provided for assistance to the Philippines in the “solution of age-old social and economic problems gravely aggravated by the last war.” In exchange for President Quirino’s promise to recommend to Congress legislation to bring about the “era of progress and plenty,” as recommended by the Bell Survey Mission,2 the Amer¬ ican Government agreed to “furnish with the least possible delay technical assistance particularly in the field of taxation and revenue collection, social legislation and economic develop¬ ment...” By virtue of this provision, the Philippines created the Philippine Council for U. S. Aid (PHILCUSA), which would collaborate with the American agency, the Economic Coopera- JMany agreements have been concluded between the two countries which deal with economic matters. Some of them are: the Abaca Fiber Agreement of August 8, 1946, the Agreement on the Establishment of the American-Philippine Financial Commission of September 13, 1946; Agree¬ ment on the Cancellation of Copra and Coconut Oil of November 5, 1946; and Agreement Regarding a Road, Street and Bridge Program of February 14, 1947. 2 See Chapter 28. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 525 tion Administration (ECA).3 Under this agreement, the PHIL- CUSA, in cooperation with and aid of the ECA, in stituted social and economic projects designed to improve the well being of the Filipinos. Philippine economy, however, has been slow in its develop¬ ment, owing to many factors, one of which being the on erous provisions of * the Bell Trade Act of 1946. To remove or at least modify them in or der to give the Philippines an even chance at economic survival, President Magsaysay sent a mission to the United States in 1954, under the chairmanship of Senator Jose P. Laurel, for the purpose of working for the removal of the patent in equalities in the Bell Trade Act. Laurel dealth with his American counterpart, James M. Langley, and after months of negotiations both countries entered into an agreement, known as the Laurel-Langley Agreement, on December 15, 1954. The Laurel-Langley Agreement, among other things, provides for the “acceleration of the application of the Philippine duties on imports from the United States and declaration of the applica¬ tion of United States duties on imports from the Philippines, during the period January 1, 1956 to July 3, 1974.” This means that or dinary customs duties on American goods would be in¬ creased gradually from 25% between 1956 and 1958; to 50% between 1959 and 1961; to 75% between 1962 and 1964; to 90% between 1965 and 1973; and to 100% between January 1, 1974 and July 3, 1974. On the other hand, or dinary customs duties on Philippine goods entering the United States would be in creased from 5% between 1956 and 1958; to 10% between 1959 and 1961; to 20% from 1962 to 1964; to 40% between 1965 and 1967; to 60% between 1968 and 1970; to 80% between 1971 and 1974; and to 100% between January 1, 1974 and July 3, 1974. In other words, the rate of in crease in the cus¬ toms duties to be imposed on American goods from 1956 to 1974 is greater than the rate of in crease in the customs duties to be imposed on Philippine goods over the same period.

The University of the Philippines at Dili¬ man, Quezon City, was selected as the site where the at omic reactor was later constructed. Cultural relations between the two countries have been broad¬ ened to in clude an exchange of professors and students. Hundreds of students and professionals have gone and are still going to the United States either to take advanced studies or to observe the workings of the American democracy. The latter, given in the form of travel grants, enable Filipinos to study American life and in stitutions at close quarters. Most, if not all, of the travel grants are usually disguised junkets which give the Filipinos the opportunity to jump from one American city to another within the space of three months. In some cases, the grants serve but little purpose, for the grantless learn advanced Amer¬ ican methods and techniques in particular areas of studies which cannot be successfully applied in the Philippines owing, first, to lack of sufficient funds, and second, to different social and eco¬ nomic conditions. At any rate, the travel grants serve the Amer¬ ican purpose of disseminating things American to the Filipino grantees who, as a matter of goodwill, rave over what they saw and experienced in America. Most of these grantees return to the Philippines as converted brown Americans who propagate the American way of life among the boors and the yokels. On the American side, Fulbright professors and students have come and gone *— and are still coming and going — and have made, at least some of them, valuable contributions to knowledge of the Philippines. A few, however, are third raters and have not provided Filipino students with perceptive analyses of the subjects they are supposed to have mastered. On the whole, the Fulbright professors and students have contributed much in further cementing Filipino-American relations and in making the “folks back home” appreciate the worth of the Fili¬ pinos and their way of life. Curiously enough, the number of Filipino-American marriages after in dependence seems to have in creased tremendously. Such in timate collaboration cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be taken as a sign of anti- Americanism. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 527 Problems of Fil-American Relations- In spite of the highly to uted “identity” of Filipino-American in terests and the close friendship that has characterized their experiment in democratic partnership, several irritants have cropped up to make the “honey¬ moon” seem sour. In the first place, the so-called identity of Filipino-American in terests is more sentimental and rhetorical than real and substantial. No two in dependent nations ever had or could have identical national in terests, owing to geographic, economic, and ideological factors. In the second place, there are actuations of the American Government and personnel which do not conform to the Filipino idea of friendship. Lastly, the Filipinos, or the more in telligent and vocal among them, have come to realize that American in tentions in the Philippines have not been exactly altruistic and benevolent. When the Philippines achieved in dependence in 1946, President Roxas lost no time in enunciating his policy of following in the wake of America in the mistaken belief that what is good for America is or must necessarily be good for the Philippines. Con¬ sequently, every American imposition was accepted blithely in the belief that what America does in the Philippines and elsewhere is done for the good of the Filipinos. In practically all in ternational questions, the Philippines, through her delegate to the United Nations, has almost always voted with the United States until, in 1959, Filipino Ambassador to London, Leon Ma. Guerrero, Jr., cried bitterly that the U. S. delegation to the U. N. had been “twisting the arm” of the Filipino delegation, that is, putting pressure on the latter in or der to vote as one with the U. S. delegation on matters favorable to the United States even if, in some matters, the reputation of the Philip¬ pines is adversely affected. Guerrero’s “declaration of in depend¬ ence” seems to be the beginning of a “revolt” and the implementa¬ tion of the Filipino First policy in the field of for eign relations. Some actuations of the American military in the Philippines have contributed to the tension in Filipino-American relations. The killings of Filipinos by Filipino or American security guards in the employ of the American armed for ces in Clark Field, Pampanga, and the refusal of the American military to hand over the killers to the Philippine courts for trial have become a major irritant. The Philippine position on the matter is based on the Military Bases Agreement of 1947 in which of fenses committed by Filipinos against Filipinos within the American bases are to be tried by Philippine courts. The American military 528 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE contend that any in vestigation into the reported killings in side the bases requires consultations with higher authorities of the American Department of Defense. This conflict of jurisdiction has in creased the tension. In 1953, President Quirino and President Eisenhower com¬ municated with each other on the importance of expanding and developing “certain U. S. military bases in the Philippines, as well as outstanding property and related questions.” Nothing resulted from this exchange of letters. Owing to bloody in¬ cidents in which alleged Filipino pilferers were shot down like dogs in side the American bases, the House of Representatives, in February 1956, took steps to re-examine Philippine-American relations. This move was in spired by the detention of Enrique Santa Maria, a Filipino mining operator, by the Clark Field authorities for mining in Bueno Hill, Capas, Tarlac, which was within the American reservation.

To resolve the bases ques¬ tions, particularly the question of jurisdiction, both countries appointed their respective panels to meet in Manila. The Phil¬ ippine panel, chairmanned by Vice-President Carlos P. Garcia, met with the American panel, headed by Karl Bendetsen, from August 11, 1956 to December 5, 1956. The Philippine position regarding the bases question, was provided by Senator Claro M. Recto when, on February 1, 1954, he refuted Attorney Gen¬ eral Herbert Brownell’s contention that the United States own¬ ed the land on which the American bases were located. Recto contended that the United States merely acquired the right to use such land. Two years later, in July 1956, the American Government declared that the United States “recognizes the sovereignty of the Philippine Government over the base lands.” This was repeated by Vice-President Richard Nixon when he visited the Philippines the same year. Thus, Recto was justified in his contention. The Garcia-Bendetsen conferences concerning the question of jurisdiction in the American bases in the Philippines ended in December 1956 with out having arrived at a reasonable so¬ lution. Meanwhile, more Filipinos have been fired upon and killed within the American base at Clark Field. In some in stances, the guilty party, if an American, was sent to the United States bn the ground that he had finished his tour of duty in the Philip¬ pines. Rightly or wrongly, the Filipinos believe that such a tenchnique is only a smokescreen to cover up the real in tention of not allowing the Philippine courts to try the accused Amer- EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 529 ican. “When, on top of this, an American lawmaker, Phil Waver, accused the Filipino pilferers of harassing the Americans within the Clark Field base, the Filipinos, in dividually and collectively, could not help thinking that the “ugly Americans” are the cause of the Filipino-American tension. The irritant became exceedingly irritating to the Filipinos when, in 1964, a Filipino boy in Clark Field was shot in the back by an American sentry. This was followed shortly by the killing of a Filipino fisherman by Amer¬ ican sentries at the Olongapo Naval Base. University students and laborers held vocal but peaceful demonstrations before the American Embassy in Manila and denounced what they believed was the unnecessary and unjustified killing of unarmed Filipinos. The American Embassy, in its at tempt to explain away the murder of the Filipino boy, issued a statement saying that certain Fili¬ pinos tried to bomb the American school at Clark Field. A bomb was shown to the press, but subsequent in vestigations showed that the bomb was a harmless one and could not have exploded. Thinking Filipinos felt that the bomb was planted to make it appear that Filipinos who came near the airfield threw the bomb at the American school. The excuse was palpably lame, and the Filipino students, laborers, and some in tellectuals held a mammoth demonstration before the American Embassy on January 25, 1965, and denounced American actuations in the Philippines. The Americans, seconded by their Filipino stooges, immediately branded the demonstration as communistic, but this smear tactic had the effect of fanning anti-American feeling. The killing of unarmed Filipinos by armed American soldiers in side or outside American military and naval bases in the Philip¬ pines continued. In 1968, a Filipino was shot to death by an American sentry in Cavite. The following year, another trigger- happy American soldier, who was off duty and, in violation of U. S. military rules, went hunting with his service pistol, in broad daylight shot to death a Filipino employee of the military base. When confronted with the murder, the American soldier said he mistook the Filipino for a “wild boar.” The. American military court hastily tried the of fender and acquitted him. A few days later, he was reported to have left for the United States. The furor that this particular in cident provoked unong the Filipino students, workers and in tellectuals led to demands for the renego¬ tiation of the Bases Treaty of 1947. The res d s of this renego¬ tiation move will determine the contour of i lipino-American relations in the years to come. 530 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE There are other irritants to Filipino-American relations, not the least of which is the Filipino belief that the United States has not been giving the Philippines adequate financial aid, con¬ sidering American aid to Japan, a for mer common enemy, which has been the recipient of American benevolence. Another irritant, so the Filipinos believe, is the failure of the United States to satisfy Filipino claims for payment, among which are the $500 million in salaries due the Philippine Army men and guerrilla units for wartime service, the $100 million in back pay to Fili¬ pinos who served with the American regular army, the $21.5 million for supplies and services rendered in 1941 by the Philip¬ pine Government to the U. S. Armed Forces, and the $5.5 million spent by the Philippine Government in processing Philippine claims against the United States Government. Most of these claims, known as the Omnibus Claims, have been rejected by the American Government. Attempts at Relaxation of Tension:- With the advent of the Garcia Administration, a modification in the Philippine for eign policy was in itiated. The modification, in the words of Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano, lay in a policy of “respect¬ able in dependence.” The year 1959 was fateful, for it saw the beginnings of a nationalistic or ientation, along Recto’s line of thinking, not only in for eign policy, but also in the national economy"

The in creasing demand of the more farsighted and nationalistic sector of the population for a re-examination of Philippine-American relations, particularly with reference to parity, the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the Laurel-Lang- ley Agreement, and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, led to a series of conferences between Secretary Felixberto Serrano and Ambassador Charles K. Bohlen late in September 1959. As a result of these Conferences, the United States agreed in principle to the Philippine demand that the ninety-nine-year lease of the bases to the United States should be cut down to only twenty- five years subject to renewal every five years. Ambassador Bohlen, however, hedged on another Philippine demand for the standby veto power in the use of American bases in the country for “critical situations short of war” but which might explode into war. The deadlock on this particular question was broken when Ambassador Bohlen, on October 12, 1959, gave in to the Philippine demands. The understanding reached with Bohlen in cluded: 1. recognition by the United States of the right of the Philip¬ pines to be consulted on the operational use of American bases EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 531 in the Philippines in situations in which the U. S. might be in volved in Asia; 2. for mal in clusion of the principle of automatic retaliation in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951; 3. prior consent of the Philippines before establishing mis¬ sile sites in the country; 4. reduction of the ninety-nine-year lease of the American bases to twenty-five years subject to renewal of termination by mutual consent; and 5. long-range programming of the different aspects of Amer¬ ican military assistance to the Philippines. On August 10, 1965, Foreign Secretary Mauro Mendez and American Ambassador William M. Blair, Jr. signed an agree¬ ment revising Article XIII of the 1947 Bases Treaty. Under the agreement which, however, does not have the effect of law, the United States agreed to (1) renounce exclusive jurisdiction over on-base of fenses, (2) define clearly the term “on-duty”, (3) improve the provisions on waivers of jurisdiction, and (4) create a criminal jurisdiction implementation committee com¬ posed of of ficials of both governments. Contributing to the relaxation of tension was the accord reached on October 23, 1959, which as finally signed in Manila on October 28, in which the United States turned over Olongapo to the Philippines. Olongapo, a part of Subic, Zambales, had been administered by the American Naval authorities and had been, for all practical purposes, an American territory where Filipinos were considered aliens. With its turnover to the Philip¬ pine Government it became, in the ory and in fact, a part of the Philippines, and the reby removed one source of irritant between the Filipinos and the Americans in that part of the country. Re-assessment of RP-US Relations.—Owing mainly to the American military’s unseemly behavior in their dealings with Filipino civilians, especially in side the military bases, many thinking Filipinos have in recent years begun to doubt the reality of the so-called special relations with the United States. The Filipinos as a people were, however, more to blame than the Americans for they, the Filipinos, had not learned the lessons of their history and had not realized that in in ternational relations the first duty of a people is to protect their national in terests. The myth of “special relations” with the United States was 532 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE rooted in Filipino belief that the Americans had nothing but pure love for the Filpinos and that this mystical love would act as a force to compel the Americans to put the welfare of the Philippines on the level with that of the United States. This naivete, which is not even charming, has been the focus of point¬ ed criticisms of the nationalists who warned the Filipinos against relying too much on the United States and hinted, in broad strokes, that the salvation of the Filipino nation lay, and still lies, in self-reliance and self-help. For this dignified, although then unpopular stand, the nationalists were called prophets of doom and communist sympathizers by the “brown Americans.,, Senator Claro M. Recto, in particular, was called nasty names by certain Filipinos who, either because of their ignorance or slave complex, fanatically believed in American benevolence and mag¬ nanimity and who, the refore, favored President Manuel A. Ro- xas’ “follow-in-the-wake-of-America policy”. In recent years, however, an in creasing number of Filipinos have been re-assessing Philippine-American relations and have, as a consequence, come to the conclusion that the so-called spe¬ cial relations with the United States was a myth. The national¬ ists, in particular, began to criticize American policy to ward the Philippines and demanded in unmistakable terms the abo¬ lition of the parity right of the Americans in the Philippines, the dismantling of the American bases, and the termination in the ranks, the nationalists in all sectors — teachers, students, of the Laurel-Langley Agreement. Realizing the need for unity in the ranks, the nationalists in all sectors — teachers, students, farmers, laborers, businessmen, in dustrialists, and professionals — banded the mselves, on February 8, 1967, into the Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (M. A. N.). The national¬ ists urged the people to stand on their own feet and to rely on the mselves for their salvation.

This last, the end of the so-called special relations, was force¬ fully and frankly brought to the at tention of the Filipinos by no less than President Richard M. Nixon. Visiting the Philippines on July 27-28, 1969, President Nixon, in a farewell note delivered at the Manila International Airport on July 28, said that “as I EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 533 come to the Philippines, in this brief stay, I hope I can in itiate a new era of Philippine-American relations, not returning to the old special relationship because the winds of change have swept away those factors, but building a new relationship which will be based on mutual trust, on mutual confidence, on mutual cooperation.” Second Plank: Implementation.—Though it is pure rhetoric to say that the Philippines occupies a “central position... in the evolving political and economic pattern of Asia,” she is nevertheless, only tangent to such pattern and, the refore, can¬ not afford to remain isolated from her Asian neighbors. In the implementation of the second plank, the Philippines supported the cause of Indonesian in dependence, and sponsored or actively participated in conferences concerning cultural, economic, and social questions that were and continue to be of paramount importance to the Orient, such as the New Delhi Conference of 1949, the Baguio Conference of 1950, the conferences of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), and the Bandung Conference of 1955. It may be said that the decade from 1950 to 1959 was an era of Asian rediscovery and re-awakening. Heretofore, owing to the in cursions of Western imperialism in the Orient, the Asian peoples lived in isolation and were not allowed by the imperialist powers to know and understand one another. The Philippines under Spain and the United States; Malaya, India, and Burma under Great Britain; Indonesia under Holland; and Indo-China under France were, so to speak, islands drifting aimlessly and with out any appreciable knowledge of one another. With Philippine in dependence, followed closely by the in dependence of India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ceylon, Viet-Nam, and, lastly, Malaya, the ancient relations among them have been resumed. Since then they have been working at redis¬ covering, first, their separate national identities, and, second, their in terdependence in cultural, social, and economic matters. Cul¬ tural and diplomatic exchanges have been, and continue to be, made among the Southeast Asian countries leading to closer understanding and amity. The Philippines concluded treaties of frienship with Pakistan on January 3, 1951; with Indonesia on June 21, 1951; with India on July 11, 1952 and on April 29, 1954; with Viet-Nam on April 26, 1959; and a cultural colla¬ boration pact with Indonesia on April 28, 1959. To emphasize the importance of good neighborliness, President Garcia visited Viet-Nam, April 21-25, 1959, and thus paved the way for the Philippines-Vietnam treaty of friendship. Such a gesture, though 534 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE superficial, is at least an in dication of the Philippines’ changing at titude to wards hex Asian neighbors. The Manila Pact.—Probably the most significant event in the relations among some Southeast Asian nations was the con¬ clusion of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), popularly called the Manila Pact, in 1954. The signing of this treaty proceeded from an awareness of the relentless march of communism in Asia. At the conclusion of World War II, West¬ ern imperialism in Asia suffered a setback and a wave of na¬ tion alism swept over that part of colonized Asia. In this post¬ war confusion, communism stepped in and, identifying itself with the struggling colonials, acquired large supplies of weapons. Most of the countries of the region were then ripe for communist pickings, for poverty, filth, and hunger led to desperation which made the people clutch at the communist straw. The pattern of communist movement first showed itself in Indo-China in 1945-46 when the native communists gained control of the guerrilla movement and in stigated the revolt against French authorities. Communist subversion spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, principally in India, Indonesia, Burma, Mala¬ ya, and the Philippines. The movement gained momentum when in 1949, Chinese communist armies of Mao Tse-Tung overran the Chinese mainland and drove Chiang Kai-shek to a hide-out in Formosa. On June 24, 1950, the Communist North Koreans in vaded South Korea, for cing the United Nations to contribute fighting for ces and relief materials to South Korea. In July 1953, an armistice was signed ending the Korean blood bath. But a year later, the communist-led Viet-Minh (Northern Indo- China) in vaded and overran the northern provice of Tonkin and advanced into Laos. This Indo-Chinese little war was halt¬ ed in 1954 by the decisions of the Geneva Conference which provided for the temporary with drawal of communists and French for ces to zones north and south, respectively, of the 17 th parallel. Viet-nam, Cambodia, and Laos were recognized as in dependent states. The dangers posed by the communist movement to the Western Powers’ position in Asia and to the in dependent exist¬ ence of some Southeast Asian countries led Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to propose, on July 23, 1954, the for mation of “collective arrangements to promote the security of the free peoples of South-East Asia.” Prince Wan Waithayakom of Thai- EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 535 land, however, expressed his country’s desire to make the collec¬ tive arrangements purely defensive in nature"

Consequently, in September 1954, eight in dependent nations — the Philippines, Australia, France, New Zealand, Thailand, Pakistan, the United States, and the United Kingdom — met in Manila to make “collective arrangements” a reality. On September 6, President Magsaysay, speaking at the opening conference, stated its objective: It is the task of this conference to help build an adequate system of defense around an exposed and threatened sector o. the world. On the success of this conference may well depend the peace of Asia in the next ten years and the future freedom in the world for the next thousand years. On September 8, the representatives of the countries in at tendance approved and signed the Manila Pact, which was designed for the defense of Southeast Asia against armed ex¬ ternal aggression. At the same time, they also approved the Pacific Charter. The Manila Pact provides for the peaceful settle¬ ment of in ternational disputes in which they might get in volved, the pooling of their resources in an effort to resist any armed at tack and to “prevent and counter subversive activities directed from with out against their territorial in tegrity and political sta¬ bility,” cooperation with one another in the promotion of their economic and social well-being, and a concerted action in the event outside aggression is directed against any of its members in accordance with the constitutional processes of each of the member states. On February 19, 1955, the SEATO for mally came into being with the ratification of the treaty by all the member-states. Thougfi well-conceived and well-in tentioned, the SEATO never¬ the less suffered from one capital weakness, namely, that it did not in clude the more important states of Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and Burma. # Of the eight member states, three — the United States, the United Kingdom, and France* — were outside the area, while two — Australia and New Zealand — were so far off that it is doubtful whether in the event of communist aggression, say, against Thailand, they jwould or could be effective in giving aid to the aggrieved nation. With India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Burma refusing to join the alliance, the SEATO was at best effective on paper. 536 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Third Plank: Implementation.-The United Nations as an in ternational body dedicated to the preservation of universal peace and to the promotion of the idea of One World was bom of bleeding humanity groping for deliverance from pain, hunger and hatred. From the moment of the birth of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945, the Philippines has played an active role in its deliberations and activities. Her role in that great in ternational body is practically mandatory, for her Constitu¬ tion al declares that she “renounces war as an in strument of nation¬ al policy.” No other constitution of any in dependent country anywhere has such a unique statement of idealism.5 The Philip¬ pines, as a participant in the drafting of the UN Charter, has worked with the UN and its in strumentalities and agencies in the promotion not only of universal peace, but also of the social and economic well-being of underdeveloped countries. The Philippine role in the activities of the UN may not be as significant as that of the great Powers like the United States, Russia, Great Britain, and France, but she has kept faith with the ideals of that in ternational body. She is a member of the Trusteeship Council and the Special Committee on Non-Self- Goveming Territories which has labored and is laboring for the in terest of the undeveloped and underdeveloped countries of the world. As a member of the Commission on Human Rights, she participated in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Philippine likewise in itiated the program of the UN guaranteeing the freedom of in for mation. Because of Philippine in terest in the liquidation of the for mer Italian colonies she was elected tb the Advisory Council for the Trust Territory of Somaliland for a term of ten years. Finally, the Philippines contributed in 1951 a combat battalion to the Ko¬ rean War as a member of the United Nations for ces. The Philippines is also a member of many of the UN’s special¬ ized agencies engaged in non-political activities. These in clude the World Health Organization, whose Asian headquarters is located in Manila, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International 5 The post-war Japanese Constitution, known as the Mac Arthur Con¬ stitution, follows the Philippine lead in renouncing war as an in strument of national policy.

Roxas, of course, had been anti-communist as shown by his out¬ lawing of the communist-led Hukbalahap or ganization, which opposed him vigorously in the 1946 elections. Upon his death on the very day that he delivered his “follow-America-wherever- she-goes” speech, his successor, Quirino, and the other presidents after him, made anti-communism a credo. On September 24, 1956, the British scholar, Arnold Toynbee, the celebrated author of the massive The Study of History, spoke at the Philippine Columbian Club and was asked, after his lecture, whether he was in favor of outlawing communism. His answer was shocking to the in telligence community and the professional witch-hunters. He was, he said, against out-lawing communism, for this would only force the communists to go underground. The wisdom of his remark was proved when Congress, during Carlos P. Garcia’s administration, passed the Anti-Subversion Law, which outlawed communism in the Philippines. The hand¬ ful of Filipino communists promptly went underground, and the in telligence agencies resorted to unfounded suspicions, unreason¬ able accusations, and plain prejudice to harass and smear the reputation of men and women who refused to swear by con¬ for mism and parochialism. The period from approximately 1950 to 1967 may be de¬ scribed as the era of witch-hunting. Professors, labor leaders, and students with liberal or ientation were branded “pinks” or “Reds” or “fellow-travelers”, thus making them suspect in the eyes of the public. It was a season of trial by publicity, when a man’s reputation was smeared in the name of democracy. 538 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE President Ferdinand Marcos, however, refused to be stampeded into or dering the government’s in telligence agencies to arrest the dissenters and non-conformists in Philippine society. In- ■ stead, he partially relaxed the ban on travel to communist coun¬ tries, a relaxation that led to the acceptance by Filipinos, some of whom were legislators and newspapermen, of in vitations to visit Red China. By 1968, businessmen, legislators, and news¬ papermen had gone not only to Red China, but also to such communist countries as Soviet Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany to know more about these countries and to lay the ground for future trade and cul¬ tural relations with them. In the same year, Russian scholars, some of whom could speak Tagalog better than many Filipinos, were allowed to enter the Philippines, and in 1969 some Russian ballet dancers were in vited to perform at the Meralco Auditorium. Another group of Russians, composed of a lady scholar of Philip¬ pine history, a journalist, and a bureaucrat, came to Manila for a visit and were in vited to many parties given in their honor. Such reception would have been labeled communistic in the 1950’s. Even so, there are still Filipinos who think in terms of the “cold war” of the late 1940’s and the 1950’s and, consequently, would not hear of any relations with communist countries. Re¬ cent developments, however, show them to be dwindling into the minority. Even the rabid Catholics who trembled with holy in¬ dignation at the mere ment ion of communism have revised their at titude and are now more or less resigned to accepting trade and cultural relations with communist countries. The reason for this turnabout lies not only in the recognition of the hard realities of in ternational politics, but also in the changes that have swept — and are still sweeping — the Vatican precisely since the liberal-minded Pope John XXIII ascended the papal throne. The ecumenism which he began is being continued by his successor, Pope Paul VI. This ecumenism has resulted in the liberalization of the Church’s thinking and practices, in cluding the recognition of the necessity to co-exist with people of oppo¬ site or even hostile ideological or ientation. The conditioning of the Filipino of ficials’ minds to absolute anti-communism, even to the extent of being ridiculous, has not made the Philippine position in Asia enviable. On the con¬ trary, most Asian countries, particularly those with in dependent for eign policies, consider the Philippines still under the colonial rule of the United States.

This agree¬ ment, known as the Manila accord, was approved in Manila on July 31, 1963 and signed by Macapagal, Sukarno of Indonesia, and Tunku Abdul Rahman of the Federation of Malaya. On August 6, the chiefs of state of the three countries issued the Manila Declaration in which they laid down the principles that would guide their countries, known as Maphilindo (Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia), namely: First, that they reaffirm their adherence to the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as enunciated in the * United Nations Charter and the Bandung Declaration; Second, that they are determined, in the common in terest of their countries, to maintain fraternal relations, to strengthen cooperation among their peoples in the economic, social and cul¬ tural progress and social well-being in the region, and to put an end to the exploitation of man by man and of one nation by another; Third, that the three nations shall combine their efforts in the common struggle against colonialism and imperialism in all their forms and manifestations and for the eradication of the vestiges the reof in the region in particular and the world in general; Fourth, that the three nations, as new emerging for ces in the region, shall cooperate in building a new and better world based on national freedom, social justice and lasting peace; and Fifth, that in the context of the joint endeavors of the three nations to achieve the for egoing objectives, they have agreed to take in itial steps to wards the establishment of Maphilindo by hold¬ ing frequent and regular consultations at all levels to be known as Mushawarah Maphilindo. A, The Breakup.—The jubilation that followed the creation of Maphilindo, which Western and some Asian observers criticized 540 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE as racially in spired,6 was shortlived, however. In preparation for the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, which would in clude, besides Malaya and Singapore, Sabah (North Borneo) and Sarawak, it was agreed, in the spirit of Maphilindo, that the peoples of the last two territories should determine in a plebiscite whether they would join the contemplated Federation. On August 1, 1963, the Malayan and British governments committed a diplomatic faux pas by issuing a joint statement in London whereby they agreed on principle that the Federation of Malaysia, which would in clude Sabah and Sarawak, would be proclaimed on August 31, 1963 — even before the results of the plebiscite were known. Indonesia and the Philippines agreed to the holding of a plebiscite in Sarawak and Sabah under the auspices of the United Nations Secretariat. On September 13, 1963, the U. N. Secretary- General submitted the findings of his teams to the governments of the Philippines, Malaya, Indonesia, and Britain. The findings showed that the peoples of Sarawak and Sabah were for joining the Federation of Malaysia. Indonesia and the Philippines demurred, saying that the plebiscite did not reflect the true feelings of the peoples of Sarawak and Sabah owing to the British pressure. Conse¬ quently, the Philippines severed diplomatic ties with Malaysia on September 16, 1963. Indonesia, under the leadership of Sukarno, not only refused to recognize Malaysia but began an anti-Malaysia campaign. While relations between the Philippines and Malaysia were characterized with in difference, those be¬ tween Indonesia and Malaysia were openly hostile. The Philippines’ basis for the non-recognition of Malaysia lay in the for mer’s territorial claim to Sabah, a claim that Malay¬ sia, backed up by Britain, naturally disputed. Obviously, Maca- pagal’s refusal to recognize Malaysia was a tactical maneuver to force the latter to recognize the Philippine claim to Sabah in exchange for Philippine recognition of the British-in spired Malaysia. The impasse was resolved when, after Marcos’ inau¬ guration as president, he promised to reestablish diplomatic relations with Malaysia. On the assurance of the Malaysian gov¬ ernment that it was not averse to elevating the question of the Philippine claim to Sabah to the World Court or to submitting 6 Although Maphilindo was composed of peoples of Malay stock, its guiding principles were non-racial.

The Dispute Over Sabah.—No sooner had the Philippines re-established diplomatic relations with Malaysia than a bitter controversy arose between them.

The fact that the disputed territory was leased by the Sultan of Sulu shows that he exercised sovereignty over the territory; 4. In 1903, the North Borneo Company, a private company, asked the “Sultan of Sulu to execute a confirmatory deed to confirm the contract of 1878 (the Lease Agreement)” and “ex¬ pressly recognized that the Sultan of Sulu was sovereign in Sabah”; 5. According to British sources, the North Borneo Company did not acquire the territory of Sabah for the British crown, for when Spain and the Netherlands raised objections over the activities of the North Borneo Company, Lord Granville and the Marquis of Salisbury, who were during their time Foreign Minis¬ ters of Britain, explained to Spain and the Netherlands that *The contract of lease of 1878 used the Tausog word “padjak” which, according to Dutch, American, and Spanish scholars, means “lease.” The Spanish documents of the period called the transaction “arrendamiento” which means “lease.\" The British, quite naturally, translate the word to mean “cession.” It is, however, surprising to note that the Company and the British Government paid the Sultan of Sulu and annual rental of 5,300 Malayan dollars up to 1963. If North Borneo had been ceded to the Com¬ pany, why the payment of an annual rental? 542 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE “the British Government assumed no dominion or sovereign rights in Borneo which was occupied by the Company and that it did not purport to grant to the Company any powers of gov¬ ernment” over the disputed territory; 6. The annexation of North Borneo by Britain in 1946, eleven days after Philippine in dependence, was illegal in the sense that the North Borneo Company, from which the British Government took Sabah, had no right of sovereignty over Sabah; consequently 7. Britain had no right to turn over Sabah to Malaysia in 1963 because she, Britain, had no sovereign right over Sabah. On the other hand, the Malaysian government anchored its claim over Sabah on the fact that: 1. Great Britain turned over Sabah to Malaysia in 1963, the reby making Malaysia the heir of Britain to Sabah; 2. In a plebiscite conducted in 1963 under the auspices of the United Nations, the Sabahans voted to be a part of the Fede¬ ration of Malaysia; and 3. The Philippine Constitution does not in clude Sabah in the delineation of the geographical limits of the Philippines. Attempts to resolve the ticklish issue proved futile: both parties refused to give in: the Philippines still refuses to give up the claim over Sabah because of historical, sentimental, and legal facts in volved in the case; and Malaysia refuses to give up Sabah not only because to do so would be to destroy the artifi¬ cially created Federation of Malaysia, but also because Sabah has rich natural resources which Malaysia as the principal in the Federation, is exploiting to the advantage of the Federation as a whole. The Philippines, in an at tempt to resolve the issue peacefully in accordance with the rule of law, suggested that the question be elevated to the World Court for decision, but the Malaysian leaders who claimed that the Philippines had neither political nor legal leg to stand on, adamantly refused to have the World Court decide the case. This at titude drew a sharp stricture from the courageous Philippines Free Press when it said: “One who is caught with the goods will, quite naturally, refuse to go to court.” In the face of Malaysia’s refusal to sub¬ mit the case to the World Court, the Philippines with drew its embassy from Kuala Lumpur; a little later, Malaysia or dered its embassy in Manila to close shop. Association of Southeast Asia.—With the reestablishment * of diplomatic relations with Malaysia, many Asian observers of EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 543 Southeast Asian development and politics felt that the late Ma- philindo with its alleged racial overtones, should be replaced with a regional association that would in clude non-Malay peoples. Hence the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), which was the brainchild of then President Carlos P. Garcia and Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. In January 1959, during Tunku Abdul Rahman’s visit to Manila, he and President Garcia issued a joint communique which called for a study of the “ways and means to elevate the standard of living and improve the material welfare of their peoples.” It was proposed, however, that other Southeast Asian countries be in vited to “subscribe to this idea.” On July 31, 1961, the As¬ sociation of Southeast Asia was for mally established in Bangkok by the representatives of the Philippines, Malaya, and Thailand. The aims, as expressed in the so-called Bangkok Declaration, were: 1. To establish an effective machinery for friendly consulta¬ tions, collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, cultural, scientific and administrative fields; 2. To provide educational, professional, technical and ad¬ ministrative training and research facilities in their respective coun¬ tries for nationals and of ficials of the associated countries; 3.

The ASEAN.—The efforts of the Southeast Asian nations to “rise up from the confines of their colonial past” and to meet the challenge of the social, economic, and cultural conditions of the region led to the founding of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which was for mally established in Bangkok, Thailand, on August 8, 1967, when the Joint Declara¬ tion was signed by the for eign ministers of five. countries - In¬ donesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The Joint Declaration, known as the ASEAN Declaration, out¬ lined the objectives and purposes as: 1. To hasten the economic, social, and cultural progress of the region; 2. To promote regional peace and stability through the rule of law; 3. To promote assistance and collaboration among the member-states in the social, economic, cultural, technical, scien¬ tific, and administrative fields; 4. To assist one another in the form of “training and re¬ search facilities in the educational, professional, technical and administrative spheres”; and 5. To encourage the study of Southeast Asian history and culture. The ASEAN, probably learning from the experience of SEATO, which is now a dead association, emphatically made it clear that it is a non-political association. For purposes of co¬ operation in matters cultural, social, economic, and adminis¬ trative the member-states consult with one another. Although non-political, the ASEAN, however, had made political decisions, such as the joint recognition of the new government of Kam¬ puchea (Cambodia) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; cooperation in having a zone of peace, freedom, and neutrality EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 545 in Southeast Asia (or iginally proposed by the late Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak); the conclusion of the treaty of amity and cooperation at Bali, on February 24, 1976, and the signing of the Declaration of ASEAN Concord, also at Bali, on the same day. The ASEAN projects, on the other hand, in clude activities in such fields as commerce and in dustry, mass media, to urism, agriculture, civil air transportation and com¬ munications, and social and cultural activities. Relations with Other Countries.—The Philippines has main¬ tained and seeks to maintain friendly relations with other coun¬ tries of the world. She has resumed her relations, now on the level of equality, with Spain, with whom she concluded a treaty of friendship on September 27, 1947, and a cultural treaty on March 4, 1949. As a result of these and other agreements with the for mer colonizer, Philippine-Spanish relations have been cemented resulting in the continuous pilgrimage of Filipino stu¬ dents and professionals to Spain. In an effort to recapture the faith and love of the Filipinos, the Spanish Government has of fered various scholarships to Filipino students to enable them to study in Spanish in stitutions of higher learning. More signif¬ icantly, the Philippine Congress, as if to reciporcate, passed a law in 1957 making the Spanish language compulsory in all high schools, colleges, and universities. There has been bitter criticism of the so-called Spanish Law, not because the language is repugnant in itself, nor that there is an at tempt to re-live the unsavory features of the past, but that the twenty-four units of Spanish required for graduation in any college exceed the units required of some students for the study of the national language — a situation that is not found in any self-respecting in dependent nation. Moreover, the Spanish Law for ces the students to sacrifice other more important subjects, particularly the sciences and the humanities, in or der to enable them to take twenty-four units of Spanish. On the practical side, the twenty-four units of Spanish in colleges and universities have not made any appreciable contri¬ but ion to the student’s reading and speaking knowledge of Spanish. Students study Spanish simply to qualify for graduation and do not evince any desire to learn the language.7 The result is waste 7 Spanish should be made compulsory for students specializing in Philip¬ pine history and in modern languages. In passing the Spanish Law, Congress took several steps backward in the development of the national language. In the passage of that law one finds the persistent germ of colonial ment ality that has afflicted most Filipinos. 546 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of money, time, and effort in for cing a language that has, as a rule, no practical value for the average Filipino student"

The Philippines has also concluded treaties of friendship with European, Oriental, and Latin American countries; with Italy, on July 9, 1947; with Egypt, on January 18, 1955; with Greece, on August 28, 1950; with Switzerland, on August 30, 1956; with Turkey, on June 30,1949; with Ecuador, on January 18, 1948; with France, on June 26,1947; with Nationalist China, on April 18, 1947; and with the Dominican Republic, on No¬ vember 2, 1952. With Japan, against whom the Philippines fought during World War II, the latter concluded the peace treaty of San Francisco on September 8, 1951. Technically, the war with Japan did not end with her surrender at Tokyo Bay in 1945; it ended, in so far as the Philippines was concerned, when the Philippine Senate ratified the San Francisco Treaty on July 16, 1956. Since this latter treaty provided for separate negotiations with countries damaged by Japan’s policy of expansion in the last war, she agreed to pay reparations to those countries, the Philippines in cluded, and to conclude reparations agreement with them. The Reparations Agreement with Japan was concluded on May 9, 1956, by the terms of which Japan agreed to pay the Philip¬ pines the amount of $800 million. With the conclusion of this agreement, Philippine-Japanese relations were normalized and the way was paved for the “pro¬ motion of those relations on the basis of friendship, mutual respect and common understanding.”8 Filipino businessmen, students, and plain pleasure-seekers began and continue to flock to Japan, first, to work for the right to receive reparations allo¬ cations; second, to study Japanese culture; and last, to taste the pleasures of the renowned Japanese hospitality and, not the least, to brandish their ignorance of the elementary rules of decency.9.1. ^ ^ 8 Joint statement of the Philippine and Japanese Governments, May 9,1956. 9 See Leon O. Ty, “About Certain Filipinos in Japan,” in Philippines Free Press, January 2, 1960. 29 THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE The almost half a century of the Americans in the Philip¬ pines was not ended with political in dependence in 1946. On the contrary, many features of colonialism remain to day. For one thing, education is predominantly American. English re¬ mains the language of in struction except in the first grades of the primary level in some provinces. Both in concept and tech¬ nique, the educational system follows that of the United States. The result is confusion in the language situation, on the one hand, and continuance of Filipino literature in English, on the other. Social changes, too, follow the pre-American and American colonial pattern in which there is an unequal distribution of wealth. This condition has resulted in social upheavals and in the multi¬ plication of grave social problems. Education.—The Philippines has an educational system that is patterned after the American tradition of education. At first primarily conditioned to the basic concepts of American demo¬ cracy, the educational system emphasized Americanism rather than Filipinism. The change of status from colony to Common¬ wealth, and from Commonwealth to Republic, has not so far radically changed the old educational pattern, for even to day any modification in the American system is exultantly followed in the Philippines — years later when the modification has lost its validity in the United States. Thus, many years after “in¬ dependence,” the Philippine educational system is still American- or iented, resulting in the perpetuation of colonial ment ality. This was deplored by no less than for mer Senate President Arturo M. Tolentino, a brilliant legal scholar and legislator, who, in October 1966, called on the educational leaders of the Philippines to reorient the educational system in such a way as to imbue the Filipino youth with a real sense of in dependence. He also urged that English be discontinued as a medium of in struction because it is in consistent with the in dependent status of the Philippines. “The continued use of English as a medium of in struction,” he said, “has created subconscious feeling that whatever comes from the United States is better than what we create in the Philippines.” Concluding his speech, he said that there was, and is, a necessity for freeing the mind of the youth from colonial ment ality. 547 548 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The changes wrought since the Commonwealth era have been those concerning the teaching of the lives of Filipino na¬ tion al heroes, the in troduction of the vernaculars in the first two grades of the primary school,1 the in troduction of a wider concept of vocational education, and the in troduction of the community schools. The effect of the first has been to awaken the in terest of the students in the role played by the Filipinos in the development of Philippine polity. The second, as exper¬ iments have shown, has in creased the school child’s learning and self-assurance, for in using his own language he loses the in hibitions and in feriority complex that characterize his pain¬ ful study of a for eign language. The third has prepared, and continues to prepare, many of the non-academic type of students for useful occupations the reby diminishing the number of mis¬ placed white collar job seekers and contributing, to a certain ex¬ tent, to the economic development of the growing national community. Higher Education.—Appetite for higher education since the end of the last war has been whetted. The result has been in¬ creased college and university enrollment. The University of the Philippines, because of its rigid rules and regulations gov¬ erning scholarship and because of its limited funds, could not accommodate the growing population of college students.

The University of the Philippines, because of its rigid rules and regulations gov¬ erning scholarship and because of its limited funds, could not accommodate the growing population of college students. This vacuum has been filled by private colleges and universities. The in crease in the number of private in stitutions of higher learning since in dependence means that more and more students have been at tracted to higher education in or der to acquire status symbol. Such proliferation of private colleges and universities has given rise to the problem of what has been derisively called “diploma mills.” The cut-throat competition among private in¬ stitutions has resulted in the graduation of half-baked students who could hardly write a grammatical sentence. Thus, the or eti¬ cally there has been an in crease in the percentage of college graduates since the Liberation. Actually, however, many of these graduates are no better than the high school graduates of the pre-war years. 1 Even as these lines are being, written-January 1960—the Department of Education is reported to have re-examined its policy of using Tagalog in the first two grades and is contemplating to revert to the old practice, that is, the use of English from Grade I up. This decision is, as reported in the press, being taken in spite of the successful experiments conducted in the use of the vernaculars in the first grades of the primary. THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 549 The problem of public and private education is serious. The public school system is, in the words of Dr. Alfredo T. Mora¬ les of the University of the Philippines, “bankrupt in finances and values.” On the other hand, the private in stitutions, with few exceptions, are bankrupt in values, though not in finances. On the higher level, many private schools and colleges are run for profit, and since profit-motive predominates over serious education, faculty members are employed not because of their competence — some, however, are very competent, — hut be¬ cause of the low salaries they are willing to accept to keep body and soul to gether. Low salaries mean more profits for the col¬ leges but less learning for the students who, in many cases, are usually only thirty minutes behind their ment ors. The net re¬ sult of such a system has been the in crease in the number of unemployed graduates which, in turn, has led to grave social problems. The Community Schools.—One of the significant changes in the educational field was the in troduction of the concept of community schools. In 1948, some enterprising and resourceful superintendents of public schools started experimenting with the community schools. The division superintendents of Bataan, Bulakan, Cebu, Cagayan, Iloilo, and Pampanga began to apply more thoroughly than it had been at tempted before this concept of education by which the activities of the schools are in tegrated into those of the community. In 1950, the convention of public schools superintendents adopted a program of community devel¬ opment through the schools. The community school concept is primarily geared to the improvement of the social, economic, and health conditions of the rural areas. The schools use actual situations and problems in the community as subjects of study. The community in turn receives help from the schools in the form of in structions in agriculture, health and sanitation, literacy, and home in dustries. No set for mulas are followed in all school divisions; the methods and approach to the problems of the community de¬ pend on the conditions of each locality. Three approaches have been evolved: the so-called Bataan approach, the Iloilo approach, and the Laguna approach. Each of these is named after the province where the method is employed. The Bataan approach emphasizes the establishment of village nurseries where seedlings are distributed at nominal cost to the 550 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE farmers and other in terested persons. The women of the province are taught cooking, sewing, and weaving by home economics teachers. In Iloilo, the school teach the farmers more production and scientific methods of farming. Crop rotation, the use of fertilizers, poultry raising, gardening, and pig raising are taught to the adults by their own school children. In Laguna and Bulakan, the »adults are taught the methods and techniques of grafting, raising hogs and ducks, breeding, feeding, and disease control. The improvement Of the living con¬ ditions in the community is the common objective of all these techniques. The Philippine community school movement has begun to at tract in ternational at tention. It was the object of consider¬ able in terest during the first United Nations Conference on Com¬ munity Development for South and South East Asia held in Manila from November 29 to December 10, 1954. The main results of this Conference were that the members 2 v 1. outlined the essential elements of a concrete plan for community development; 2. exchanged in for mation on the policy, structure, successes and failures of their own programmes; and 3. suggested methods for in creasing regional cooperation and achieving better utilization of the services of the in ternational or ganizations to promote community development. The Language Situation.-The Philippines has been both. for tunate and unfortunate in having been conquered by for eign Powers. The almost four centuries of for 3 ign domination have made many Filipinos polyglots. Through the acquisition of Spanish and English, educated, Filipinos have come into contact with the cultural and scientific works of the most advanced countries of the world. As a consequence, they have imbibed the Western cultural tradition. But, on the other hand, the acqui¬ sition of this Western cultural or ientation has resulted in the submergence of those Asian values which are the bases of a national culture in evolution. Thus, many Filipinos, while learned in for eign languages and literatures, are grossly ignorant of their own.

The repre¬ sentatives of the UN and its agencies also participated in the discussions. THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 551 While such confession does not necessarily mean that they are less Filipino than the rest of the people, it is, nevertheless, an in dication that in acquiring knowledge of other languages and culture they also lost their capacity for understanding their own heritage. Thus, the average Filipino is confused and spirit¬ ually uprooted from his native habitat. This situation, as has been in timated, is the upshot of for¬ eign conquest. First, a small number of Filipinos learned Span¬ ish and became the social and cultural £lite. While the friars contributed much to the preservation of the Philippine languages, the Filipino Slite, who had acquired a slavish ment ality, never cared to follow up the friars’ lead and maintained, in stead, an at titude of superiority over those who spoke their own languages. Thus, some Filipino families used Spanish in their homes and brought up their children in ignorance of their own. Such at titude was copied by a segment of the lower class who, possessing more imagination than wisdom, proceeded to evolve a kind of Spanish: cha bacano — a vulgarized Spanish liberally sprinkled with vulgarized native words and phrases. Second, with the coming of the Americans the Filipinos learned another for eign language. Spanish continued at first to dominate the circle of high society, but in the 1930’s it gave way to English. At the same time, the Philippine languages continued to be-used in the homes, while Tagalog, the language of the capital and the provinces around it, successfully held its own against English and Spanish. The young generation became the purveyors of English and made it the medium of communication among the mselves. With the in auguration of the Commowealth, Tagalog began to assume a national role. It is now taught in the schools and, since 1946, has been one of tha of ficial languages of the country. Rightly or wrongly, the purveyors of English blame the teaching of Tagalog as a primary factor in the deterioration of English in the Philippines. The language situation in which Filipino children are taught a language for eign to their daily lives and community experience has persisted to this day. It presents a problem in the schools where, aside from Tagalog, the students learn English and their native languages. The confusion was compounded when Spanish was made compulsory in universities and colleges. The result of such a Babel of languages is a half-baked knowledge of all but their own regional languages. 552 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The hostility with which Tagalog has been met by many Filipinos of Western cultural or ientation is based on the ground that it is not yet developed. The argument is vicious, for no language can be developed if it is not given a chance to be used nationally. Language is something that is evolved; it does not spring from the head of Athena complete and fully developed. If Tagalog, as the basis of the national language, has not developed as its devoted exponents devoutly wish it to be, it is because in fluential Filipinos the mselves, owing either to colonial ment ality or to regional prejudices, are opposed to having a national lan¬ guage of their own and prefer to fool the mselves into believing that they are masters of a for eign one whose nuances they do not even understand., Self-deception is the worst tragedy of the Filipinos as a people. The Filipino Language.—The bitter controversy that arose from the national language issue led the authorities of the Depart¬ ment of Education to propose a solution by using Pilipino, in stead of Tagalog, as the national language. The reason is based not on any scientific explanation but on purely practical ground, namely, to neutralize the bull-headed opposition of the professional anti-Tagalog by not ment ioning the word Tagalog which, to the oppositionists, smacks of superiority. So Tagalog is now being used only as a basis but is not the national language, although to all appearances Pilipino, or the national language, is patently Tagalog. So as not to arouse the suspicion of the non-Tagalogs, some writers in Pilipino try to dilute the language not with words from other Philippine languages — although the or etically this should be done — but from English. Sentences are liberally and in discriminately sprinkled with English words and phrases, thus making the alleged Pilipino language Taglish (Tagalog and English) or Engalog (English and Tagalog). Such expressions as “Dito sa aming area ay very good ang tubo ng mga plants”; “Iyan pong mga vendors sa streets ay pinagbabawalan ng mga authorities na huwag magdistribute ng mga propaganda leaf¬ lets”; “Love na love si Juana Kay Pete who is jobless”, etc., are becoming common not among the common people, but among the college students. It is to be observed that the com¬ bination of Pilipino and English is actually the result not of any desire to make Pilipino universal, but of the ignorance of the speakers, for it is obvious that the English words have equi¬ valents in Pilipino. But because many speakers, especially those THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 553 whose education was limited to English, are ignorant of Pilipino, they force English words and phrases into Pilipino sentences on the ground that they are merely developing a language which the masses understand. Actually, the masses do not understand the bastard language that is now being used by radio and television announcers and commentators"

Actually, the masses do not understand the bastard language that is now being used by radio and television announcers and commentators. One notes that practically all radio and television announcers impose their ignorance of the language on the listeners and viewers. Thus, announcers say “groserya” for grocery; “supprta- han” for support, and many others. From these, one concludes that the announcers think in English, translate (or think they translate) the terms into Spanish and then “Pilipinize” them. Thus, “groserya” is what the announcers think is the Spanish translation of the English grocery, when the fact is that this word is not grocerta in Spanish but almacen de comestibles. Groceria in Spanish means grossness. On the other hand, supor- tahan is supposed to be the “Pilipinized” form of the Spanish suportar, but the English support, in the sense of backing up, say, a candidate, a movement, and the like, is not suportar in Spanish but apoyo. The meaning of suportar is to carry or ease another fellow’s burden. These announcers and their few sym¬ pathizers mistakenly believe that they are using the language of the people, when actually they are in venting a language the people do not understand. But then supporters of this kind of bastard language will say that imbecility is one of the sources of the enrichment of languages. On this, there can be no dis¬ agreement. Tagalog Literature.—The ascendancy of Tagalog in the mid- 1930’s led to a literary activity that even the Japanese were not able to arrest. The writers, though chafing under external restraints imposed by the conquerors, were nevertheless free to write on any subject save the ugly side of the Occupation. They wrote on pre-war social problems which, since approxi¬ mately the early 1920’s, had been neglected in favor of fantasy and romances. In the post-war years, they began to turn to the war experiences and produced, for the most part, propa¬ ganda literature. A few literary magazines appeared during the first years after the Liberation, the most prominent among them being Malaya, Ilang-Ilang, Sinag-Tafa, Liwayway, and Bulaklak. The last two, because of their popular appeal, still exist. The Liwaywhy, though not strictly a literary magazine, is nevertheless an effective in strument for the propagation of Tagalog; its cir¬ culation exceeds any of the big newspapers in English. 5.54 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Of the literary types in prose, the short story has been, since the late 1920’s, the favorite among the writers. It has super¬ seded the novel, which reached the apex of popularity in the second decade of the century. The writers of the 1930’s and the post-in dependence era belong to a group who have imbibed much of American civilization. It is, the refore, not surprising that the practitioners of the art should follow in the footsteps of Hemingway, Saroyan, Poe, Gale, Anderson, Faulkner, and others. While a few of the writers have declared their in depend¬ ence from for eign authors, many still continue to copy the style, even the mannerisms, of the latter. Significant stories since the last war have been written by Genoveva D. Edroza-Matute, Serafin C. Gunigundo (who changed his surname to Gunigundo* for polit¬ ical purposes), Macario Pineda, Elpidio P. Kapulong, Hilario Coronel, Pablo N. Bautista, and Pedro S. Dandan, whose works have been in cluded in short story anthologies. Of the latter, five have appeared since 1946: Mga Piling Katha (1947), collected and edited by Alejandro G. Abadilla; Ang Maikling Kwentong Tagalog: 1886-1948 (1949); collected and edited with ahistorico- crjtical in troduction by Teodoro A. Agoncillo; Ako’y Isang Tinig (1952), a collection of the stories and essays of Genoveva D. Edroza-Matute; Ang Maikling Kathang Tagalog (1954), collected and edited by Alejandro G. Abadilla; and Mga Agos sa Disyerto (1964), a collection of stories by the young writers of the 1960’s. The encouragement of the short story came in 1951 when a liquor manufacturer founded the Carlos Palanca, Sr. Memorial Awards for Literature (Tagalog and English) and of fered PI,000 for the best short story of the year, P 500 for the second best, and P 25 Q for the third best. The best stories for each year are picked by the literary editors who submit their entries to the Board of Judges. The defect of this method, at least in the Taga¬ log division, is that the preliminary choice of entries is left in the hands of editors who cannot distinguish between a short story and a novel. This defect became obvious in 1952 when the members of the Board of Judges, confronted with many bad stories submitted by the editors, had to pick the best among the worse. Many well-written and significant stories were left out of com¬ petition owing to the fact that the editors could not understand them. Poetry, the favorite of the Tagalogs, has become stale. Its decline since the Liberation has been caused by the competi¬ tion of the novel, the short story, and the comic strips. Poets, THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 555 compared with the other writers, are not paid well. As a conse¬ quence, the poets and budding poetlings change their direction and try their hand at the more lucrative types: the short story, the novel, and script writing. Only a few unregenerated and confirmed poets, like Manuel Car. Santiago, Manuel Principe Bautista, Ruben Vega, the late Elpidio P. Kapulong, Amado V. Hernandez, the Veteran poet-newspaperman-labor leader, and a few others, have written verses of quality. Alejandro G. Aba- dilla, the for emost exponent of free verse in Tagalog and who considers himself an inch above Walt Whitman, sometimes dabbles in poetry to prove that there is no in congruity in being an in surance agent and being a poet"

Many well-written and significant stories were left out of com¬ petition owing to the fact that the editors could not understand them. Poetry, the favorite of the Tagalogs, has become stale. Its decline since the Liberation has been caused by the competi¬ tion of the novel, the short story, and the comic strips. Poets, THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 555 compared with the other writers, are not paid well. As a conse¬ quence, the poets and budding poetlings change their direction and try their hand at the more lucrative types: the short story, the novel, and script writing. Only a few unregenerated and confirmed poets, like Manuel Car. Santiago, Manuel Principe Bautista, Ruben Vega, the late Elpidio P. Kapulong, Amado V. Hernandez, the Veteran poet-newspaperman-labor leader, and a few others, have written verses of quality. Alejandro G. Aba- dilla, the for emost exponent of free verse in Tagalog and who considers himself an inch above Walt Whitman, sometimes dabbles in poetry to prove that there is no in congruity in being an in surance agent and being a poet. Abadilla’s activities are not confined to selling in surance policies and writing poetry; he is also an assiduous anthologist of verses, short stories, and essays. In 1949, after cajoling the poets into giving him their best poems, Abadilla put out Parnasong Tagalog, the first major anthology of poetry. This collection represents all schools and tendencies in Tagalog poetry. In a lengthy and obscure in troduction, Aba¬ dilla laid down, in the manner of a man about to give up his ghost, his so-called literary testament. Not contented with this achievement, he put out his collection of verses in 1955 and entitled it Ako ang Daigdig at Iba pang Tula. Of the postwar Filipino poets, the greatest was the late Amado V. Hernandez whose collections of poems Isang Dipang Langit (1961) and Bayang Malaya (1969) contain the most beautiful and significant poetry written in the Philippines. Hernandez won the Republic Cultural Heritage Award and the National Artists Award, the latter posthumously in 1973. His death in 1970 was a great loss to Philippine literature. In the early 1960’s, some Tagalog poets resuscitated the old Tagalog poetic form, the tanagh; Like the Malay pantun, the tanagh is a quatrain and is a poem in itself. It has seven syllables to a line with a monorine, while the pantun has irregu¬ lar lines ranging from eight to eleven syllables to a line. Two collections of tanagb have been published: Jose Villa Panganiban’s Tanaga, Haikku, Pantum (1963) and Alejandro G. Abadilla’s Tanagabadilla (1965). The for mer follows the traditional form and rime of the tanaga, while the latter reduces the number of syllables to six to a line and changes the rime schme to a b a b, or alternate rime. At almost the same time, a small group of college students began writing in free verse which deals realistic¬ ally with everyday scenes and happenings. They are called the 556 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Bagay group because their language is not “poetic” but is made to fit the language of the people in the laboratory. Obviously, these writers have been in fluenced by the contemporary English and American poets whose conscious use of symbols and “special¬ ized” language has made poetry reading a sort of punishment. There is no need to discuss lengthily the novel and the essay. The novels, with the probable exception of Abadilla and Kapu- long’s Pagkamulat ni Magdalena (1958), Edgardo Reyes’s Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (1966), and one or two others not so distin¬ guished, are definitely potboilers. Many of the novels published in the popular weeklies derive their in spiration from American teleplays and comic trips. The essay, on the other hand, is not popular with the public and so even the competent writers seldom write essays for lack of proper in centive and appreciation. How¬ ever, some critical essays were collected in book form and pub¬ lished in 1972. It is Virgilio S. Almario’s Ang Makata sa Panahon ng Makinay which did not sell more than two hundred copies. Earlier, Alejandro G. Abadilla collected some essays and plain articles and published them under the title Mga Piling Sanaysay (1950), but it never sold more than 500 copies. In the literary contests conducted by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1975, the winning essays had no depth, although the authors show a promise of fulfillment. The drama, which had beep moribund, is now awakening and the younger writers, notably Rolando Tinio, Rogelio Sikat, Domingo Landicho, Amelia Lapena-Bonifacio, and a few of the youngsters, are showing signs of improving the drama and the stage. The role of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in pro¬ moting Pilipino literature is not in significant. Its continuous support of the writers and artists will bear fruit in the form of readable verses and plays fit for the stage. Looking back to the years when the first American soldiers set foot on Philippine soil and when the writers in Tagalog began, for the first time, to express the mselves freely, one is pained to note why the writers in Tagalog, in spite of the searing national and in dividual experiences they have had, in cluding those of the Japanese Occupation, have so far failed to produce the novel or the drama that can rightly be called great literature. There was expectation in some sanguine quarters that with the Japanese Occupation the writers would take time out to ponder and feel the significance of those three years under the heels of the enemy THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 557 and write the epic, drama or novel in the language in which they have been reared. To date, there is no sign that such event will materialize in the near future. Why? Is it because of language problem? Hardly, for there are many competent writers in Taga- log. Is it because a literary genius has not yet appeared? Perhaps. Or is it because there is no money in good literary works? But since when have great works given their authors enough material compensation to bring leisure to their harassed lives? But, then, when one thinks of the history of the Filipino people and of the youth of the nation, one is tempted to exclaim, “Look, don’t be impatient; Rome was not built in a day!” Filipino Literature in English.—Filipino writing since in¬ dependence has acquired a distinction that even for eign writers like Wallace Stegner and Hortense Calisher have noted. As in the preceding epochs, the American colonial and the Common¬ wealth, the Filipino writers in English have been more in terested in poetry and the short story than in the novel and the drama, although in these latter types a few have tried their hand and succeeded creditably, within the limitations of language"

A few of the pre-war writers continue to write as though age has not made them stale.3 Some such writers are Bienvenido N. San¬ tos, who put out his The Wounded Stag, Brother, My Brother, You Lovely People (stories); the late poet Amador T. Daguio, who was almost consumed by The Flaming Lyre (verse); N. V. M. Gonzalez whose prolific pen produced Seven Hills Away (stories), A Season of Grace (novel), Children of the Ash-Covered Loam and Other Stories, Bamboo Dancers (novel) and Look, Strangers, On This Island Now; Juan C. Laya who wrote This Barangay (novel); Jose Garcia Villa, who sent to the world Volume Two (verse) and Selected Poems and New; Severino Montano, famed for his Arena Theater, who published Three One-Act Plays; Wilfredo M. Guerrero, who has produced 13 Plays, 8 Other Plays, 7 Plays, etc. Among the post-in dependence writers who have produced enough significant pieces to entitle them to place in the history of Filipino literature in English are Nick Joaquin, whose Prose and Poems and The Woman Who Had Two Navels, though much admired and talked about as a matter of fashion, have not sold 3 As a rule, the literary life of the Filipino writer in English ends at forty or the reabouts, by which time he has enough disillusionment to continue writing creatively for almost nothing. 558 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 1,000 copies; Edilberto K. Tiempo, who has written two novels — Watch in the Night and More Than Conquerors; Esteban (Amer¬ icanized: Steven) Javellana, whose novel, Without Seeing the Dawn, has won critical acclaim; Ricaredo Demetillo, poet and critic, who has collected his verses, No Certain Weather, and has written a long poem La Via and an epic Barter in Panay; and Alejandrino G. Hufana, who has recently put out some of his verses in a volume called Sickle Season and a thicker volume Poro Point. In humor, which has been neglected by most Filipino writers, there are two standouts: Alejandro R. Roces, Jr. and C. V. Pedroche. The for mer’s Of Cocks and Kites, though in ferior to a chapter in Rizal’s Noli which deals with cockfighting, shows native humor at one of its best. Roces’ achievement is all the more significant when one considers that he had not seen the in side of a cockpit and that he is a bourgeois — and cockfighting is a plebeian pastime.4 Pedroche’s “Ray stories” belong to fantasy and their humor depends more on situation than on wit. Of Filipino poetesses of the post-war period, Edith K. Tiempo and Virginia Moreno have made their mark. The latter has, since 1959, threatened to collect her poems in a volume but has so far not been able to do so. In the short story, Edith K. Tiempo, Kerima Folotan-Tuvera, and Gilda Cordero-Femando have con¬ sistently written significant pieces. In the essay, Carmen Guerrero- Nakpil is in the front rank. Keen, witty, and subtle, she shows, both in her longer essays and in her for mer daily newspaper columns, depth as well as breadth of vision and an elastic style that is at once charming and in cisive. Of critics there are few, probably because there are few works to criticize and because the critic’s job is a thankless one: Teodoro M. Locsin, Edilberto K. Tiempo, Ricaredo Demetillo, Manuel R. Viray, who stopped his critical sallies a few years after publishing the poetry anthology, Heart of the Island, in 1947, and Armando D. Manalo, who is now counted among the respectable. The Filipino writers in English may not have produced great works of literature, but doubtless they have done some competent writing. The choice of language may be a happy one to a few, as in the case of N. V. M. Gonzalez and Nick Joaquin, but in 4 In recent years some members of the upper class have in vaded this pastime. There is, the refore, the danger of imparting respectability to this proletarian game. THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 559 general English, whose nuances are too difficult for an Oriental mind to master, does not lend itself easily to the expression of the Filipino way of life. This problem of language as a medium of literary expression is so deceptive that many Filipino writers in English, believing in their “genius”, actually think this for eign language should be the national language of the Filipinos. This problem of language gains significance when one is confronted with a story in English concerning, say, ajeepney driver or a laborer. In the English story, the poor jeepney driver talks like an Amer¬ ican with a mastery of the American idioms. Thus life is falsified and becomes a bad translation of reality. That N. V. M. Gonzalez and Nick Joaquin have written competently about Filipino life in a language not their own is no argument at all, for they are exceptions rather than the rule. How many Gonzalezes and Joaquins are there in the country? A Joaquin or a Gonzalez does not compose the cross-section of the national literature; each is a mere cog in the great wheel of Filipino culture. Doubts have been expressed by some writers in English — N. V. M. Gonzalez does not merely doubt it; he is sure of it! — whether Filipino literature in English could be the national litera¬ ture. In the first place, mastery of the language to day is in versely proportional to its wide dissemination, for less and less number of Filipinos understand its nuances. In the second place, the Filipino writers in English have a very limited audience, a fact which results from the preceding factor. Statistics to the con¬ trary notwithstanding, only an in significant number of Filipinos really know the English language. It would be in teresting to make a survey of Filipinos who have read the works of Villa, Joaquin, Gonzalez, the Tiempos, Polotan-Tuvera, and a few others, and find out how many understood the works of those writers"

It would be in teresting to make a survey of Filipinos who have read the works of Villa, Joaquin, Gonzalez, the Tiempos, Polotan-Tuvera, and a few others, and find out how many understood the works of those writers. Offhand, it can be surmised that of the 37.2% of those alleged to have an understanding of English only probably about.05% can read with understanding. That the English language has a sad adventure in the Philip¬ pines, as elsewhere in Asia, as for in stance, in Singapore and Hong Kong, is shown when some radio and television announcers and commentators unconsciously or deliberately emasculate it to exhibit their personal deficiencies. “Teek it awee,” said a famous television director, and one found on eself confronted with a language that is not listed in any dictionary or linguistic at las. One listened to the director in tently to discover a clue to the mysterious language - and came to the conclusion that what 560 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE he actually meant to say was “Take it away”. Or take an army sergeant who, in a moment of ecstacy, shouted, “Geeb wee to the preesiden!” and shoved the noisy people in the airport apron. A for eigner could not understand the fellow and turned to a Filipino half in consternation and half in jest. The Filipino, knowing the context of the situation, explained that the ecstatic sergeant simply meant “Give way to the President!” Or again the experience of a Filipino professor of English whose student wrote in his theme paper: “My father was quiet. He does not talk. He was preserved. ” Thereupon, the professor wrote on the margin: “Of course, how could a preserved man talk?” Note also the grammar. This is common even among college students. To give a complete list of Filipino unconscious humor as expressed in English is to write a book on it. To read the Filipino college students’ theme papers is to pass through the gates of Hell. It is for this reason that in structors of English in Filipino colleges look as if time and tide had been merciless to them. The question may be asked whether any of the major Philip¬ pine languages is sufficiently developed to be a fit medium for literary expression. The answer is yes. This is evidenced by the literary output in any of the eight major languages of the Philip¬ pines. But it is not, however, a happy medium for literary ex¬ pression if Filipino writers continue to look down upon their own languages, if they persist in thinking the for eign way, in describing local scenes in round-about exotic terms, in delineating character in italicized native words, and in making dialogues that are native only because the story is published in the Philip¬ pines. Manuel E. Arguilla, one of the for emost local colorists in English, and Macario Pineda, the best local colorist in Tagalog, are a case in point. Compare Arguilla’s “Mid-Summer” with Pineda’s “Rung Baga sa Pamumulaklak,” both supremely beau¬ tiful in their local color. The for mer lacks the immediacy and in timacy of the latter. The reason is that Arguilla, polished as he was, had to translate local objects and relations into Eng¬ lish — and translation, in the words of a Ming emperor, is always a treason. On the other hand, Pineda was never confronted with the problem that beset Arguilla. It is for this reason that Pineda was always faithful and fresh, while Arguilla was merely dexterous. One was a natural artist; the other a consummate craftsman. The Arts.—Plastic arts in the Philippines have been, for the most part, of European type and background. From Damian THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 561 Domingo, “the father of Filipino painting,” to Fernando Amor- solo, Filipino painting has been largely in fluenced by European, especially Spanish, brush. This tendency continued down to the end of the American colonial period. In the mid-1930’s, however, Filipino painters, many of whom had studied in Amer¬ ican art schools, in troduced the so-called modernist concept of art. Victorio Edades, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Hernando R. Ocam¬ po, Galo B. Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, and a few others, led the “modernist” school. There was furor not only in the ranks of the painters the mselves, but also among the laymen and critics. Ignacio Manlapaz, wit and art critic, and Guillermo E. Tolentino, the great Filipino sculptor, — both from the University of the Philippines — denounced the new trend as a hoax. Edades and the two Ocampos promptly came to the defense of the “modern¬ ists” and in turn accused the “conservative” group of misunder¬ standing the nature and function of art. The “critical debate” subsided during the Japanese Occupation, but when the smoke of battle was lifted in 1945 the “modernists” found the mselves enjoying a wide reputation. Composed mostly of young men and women, the “modernists,” rebelling against the alleged despotic tradition of the School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines, called for a creative approach to painting, maintaining that painting is not a “medium for a story or literature or any extraneous matter alien to plastic art.” This in dividualistic philosophy of art led to the rise of the Neo-Realist school of painting. Originally composed of Vicente Manansala, Cesar F. Le- gaspi, Hernando R. Ocampo, Romeo V. Tabuena, Victor Otey- sa, and Ramon Estella, the school expanded its membership to in clude such notable painters as Victorio Edades, Arturo Ro- gerio Luz, Fernando Zobel, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Anita Mag- saysay-Ho, Cenon Rivera, Nena Saguil, Jose T. Joya, Jesus Ay- co, and others. Their works have been “popularized” by art as¬ sociations, notably the Art Association of the Philippines and the Philippine Art Gallery.

Not belonging to the Neo-Realists but nevertheless a very competent painter is Carlos V. Francisco who died in 1969. He stood between the “conservative” and the “modernist.” He was the for emost Filipino muralist. Some of the abstract paintings of the Neo-Realists have been under at tack for being in comprehensible and have been variously described as lunatic expressions and as symbols of a 562 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE confused and decadent society. These abstract paintings, though, have one great advantage over other kinds of painting: they can be hung on the walls in any position one likes and get away with it.5 The trend of “modem” Filipino painting is to wards the blending of Oriental and Occidental elements. The Orientalism in contemporary painting is shown in rich brilliant colors, in the subject of the in dividual painter, in the decorative tend¬ ency, and in the calligraphic technique. The same rebellion, but not so in tense, that characterizes the development of Filipino painting is shown in sculpture. The wood and stone works of Napoleon V. Abueva, the for emost sculptor among the Filipino “modernists”, show a radical de¬ parture from the classicism of Guillermo E. Tolentino, the high priest of Filipino sculpture. “Modernist” sculpture, unfortunate¬ ly, is not as popular as “modernist” painting, probably because most people are not yet sufficiently exposed to the beauty and meaning of, say, a piece of sculptured stone which looks like an almirez (stone mortar and pestle), or a piece of wood which, to many, looks like a paddle. Thus, one lay commentator, looking at the photographs of some of Abueva’s pieces, acidly commented: “Is this modem sculpture? Give my six-month old baby a clod and he will fashion it with his tiny hands into something superior!” Filipino art has its competent critics in E. Aguilar Cruz, Rica- redo Demetillo, Emmanuel Torres, Leonidas Benesa, and Alfredo R. Roces. The first, in particular, is the only art critic hereabouts who connects art expressions to Filipino life. Lately, Emmanuel Torres has entered art criticism. Through the efforts of art critics and of the artists the mselves, art appreciation has now become a fashion in dulged in by many as a form of escape from the sordid aspects of life and by a few as an occasion to rattle off technical nonsense to impress the naive and the ignorant. The new rich, in particular, build mansions and buy “modernist” paintings to show that they, too, are “civilized.” Of music, there is little to say. With the death of Nicanor Abelardo and Francisco Santiago, the two great Filipino com- 5 The author once asked a friend, a great modernist painter, if the two abstract paintings in the for mer’s study were correctly hung. Said the painter: “You can hang them any way you like; there’s no difference.” THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 563 posers, Filipino music has, as a rule, turned to the rhumbastyle of noise. The efforts of such heroic musicians and musicologists as Antonio J. Molina, Felipe P. Padilla de Leon, Eliseo Pajaro, Antonino Buenaventura, Lucio San Pedro, Jose Maceda, and Hilarion Rubio, to develop Filipino music by the use of folk literature and folk songs as the matic materials have so far failed to arouse popular in terest and sympathy. The primary cause of this apathy to Filipino music is the corroding in fluence of the American popular song hits which fill the air lanes almost twenty-four hours a day. Thus the radio stations, in stead of exerting a civilizing in fluence on the audience, actually encourage vulgarization of the latter’s taste. The multiplicity of “combos” and the dearth of active symphony or chestras present a study in contrast: the vulgar completely dominating the civilized. It is true, if the newspapers can be relied upon, that there seems to be three or four symphony or chestras, but a close scrutiny of the musicians shows that there is actually only one or chestra. How vulgar the taste of the average Filipino has become is shown by a comparative study of the at tendance in a “combo” exhibition and a concert or stage production. The audience in, say, Padilla de Leon’s Noli Me Tangere and Pajaro’s Binhi ng Kalayaan is pitifully small compared with that in, a “combo” contest in any riverside the ater or the British Beatles’ idiotic outpourings. Such cultural imbalance is as much the result of uncritical “borrowing” as of the social conditions.

The Social Scene.-The stratification of Filipino society after the last war has become so marked that one finds the base of the triangular structure widening, while the apex remains practically the same as before the war. One significant change in the structure, however, is the growth of the middle class. Many who, before the war, occupied the lower middle-class rung now belong to the middle or upper middle class. The growth of the latter may be explained by the in creased demand for professional services and the corresponding in crease in the number of professionals. At the same time, the number of small businesses also in creased resulting in the swelling of the ranks of that class. This gathering strength finds ample expression in the aggressive¬ ness with which the members of the class conduct the mselves in matters of public in terest. What has been loosely termed public opinion 6 is not really the opinion of the masses or of the wealthy upper class, but that of the middle class. It is true that public opinion is and can be generated by the upper class through bribery. aid lobby — which is a form of bribery — but the expression of that opinion is the function of the middle class, who are tangent to the masses and, the refore, in a position to in fluence them. The upper class, composed of the uncultured wealthy, has remained practically the same as before the war, with this dif¬ ference, however: that the pre-war upper class was composed largely of big landowners, while the post-war upper class consists largely of in dustrialists and big businessmen, with the landowners occupying the third place. The relegation of the big land owners to the cellar of the upper — class pyramid has been brought about, first, by the serious agrarian problems that beset the land- owners; second, by the awakening of the peasants to their rights to live decently as free men and women and their consequent demand for agrarian reforms; and lastly, by the decrease in the export quotas of important Philippine products which, in the final analysis, also decreases the profits of the hacenderos. These factors to uch upon one another and explain the twilight of the once- powerful hacenderos. Feudal relationship between peasant and landowner still exists, but it L loosening against the impact of progressive laws and of partial in dustrialization. 6 In the deepest sense of the word, public opinion is still non-existent. THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 565 On the other hand, the masses have multiplied to the extent unheard of in pre-war years. Increase in opportunities for employ¬ ment has not yet overcome the rapid in crease in population, resulting in the multiplication of the number of jobless proletariat. When one considers that a large number of school children become “school or phans”, that is, they leave school before or after finish¬ ing Grade IV, and that they eventually become peasants or laborers, one ceases to wonder why the base of the triangular structure of society has widened considerably since the end of the war. There is, then, a strong contrast between the upper and the lower classes: the for mer, constituting an in significant number, are earning more and more and the latter less and less. In other words, the distribution of wealth is one-sided as to make society top heavy. The result of such an unbalanced development of society is discontent on a grand scale, on the one hand, and grave social problems, on the other. The first is amply demonstrated in the Hukbalahap and the other agrarian movements and the second in the. rise in juvenile delinquency, in immorality in high places, in graft and corruption, in in fluence peddling, in the rise in cri¬ minality, and, finally, in the rise of a new class: the squatters. Juvenille delinquency among the masses is something to be expected because economic in security breeds unlawful acts. But the more serious delinquency appears in the wealthy and the well-to-do families whose economic status, under normal con¬ ditions, should have kept their young from mischief. The sud¬ den spurt of middle and upper-class juvenile delinquency in the post-war period can only be explained by parental delinquency, for parents, in their craze for wealth and power and social po¬ sition, have become so demoralized as to leave their children to fend for the mselves. These parents find in gambling sessions and so-called social activities outlets for their unoccupied hours, and leave their children or phans in their own homes. The con¬ sequence is that the children go out into the streets to pick quarrels, throw stones at houses, break glass windows, and rob and kill for the sake of the experience. The teen-age gangs that have sprouted in urban centers testify to the moral degradation of many parents of the middle and upper classes. The schools could help but little, for they are powerless with out the active cooperation of the homes. Some of the teen-age gangs study in exclusive schools where religion is a paramount subject. 566 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The last war which has left its ugly scars on the people has made men and women, in general, callous.

The Spanish noble term delicadeza has joined the realm of fiction. Where before a public of ficial would not hesitate for a moment to resign from his post at the least in timation of lack of confidence or of adverse public opinion, to day public functionaries do not care for public opinion and morality and cling to their positions like a leech — in more senses than one. A change in moral values and climate has taken place, so that public of ficials, who should and are expected to conduct the mselves in a manner befitting their exalted positions, carry on illicit relations with “back street” women with complete abandon, and even go to the extent of parading their “catch” with out qualms. This has come to pass, for the people, who have lost their sense of proportion, secretly admire the callous disregard for morality and hence in directly encourage public of ficials in their extracurricular activities. The Filipinos’ capacity for in dignation has suffered an at rophy. Graft and corruption and in fluence peddling are the twirl results of a desire to become rich overnight since to be rich is to be respected and envied. Graft and corruption had existed before, but the malady reached its crisis in the post-war years when opportunities for sudden wealth in creased a thousand times. The national and in dividual experiences during the ene¬ my occupation no doubt are largely responsible for this tend¬ ency. It was during the occupation that many “have-nots”, whose wits had been sharpened by poverty and social and eco¬ nomic dislocation, entered the buy-and-sell trade and in no time graduated to the ranks of the “haves”. They paraded their wealth and threw lavish parties in the midst of panic, disaster, and extreme poverty. The less for tunate could only stare in amaze¬ ment and envy, but when the opportunity presented itself after the war, they, who had learned the bitter lessons of poverty, joined the ranks of the sharpers and the cheats in a desperate bid to improve their economic status. Thus the or igin of the new rich. Not accustomed to the finer things of life, the new rich now give Gargantuan parties, send their in nocent children to exclusive convent schools, or ganize bogus asaltos, and tantalize the “have-nots” with their ill-gotten gains. All this is being done to wipe out their proletarian background, on the one hand, and to impress gullible society with their power and in fluence, on the other. The extreme poverty that appeared in the backwash of war has given rise to starvation in some communities and to crimi- THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 567 nality. The unequal distribution of material possessions, in which the rich wallow in wealth and the poor in filth, is one of the reasons for the rise in criminality. It is true that there was, too, an unequal distribution of wealth before the war, but the in equality is so marked in the post-war era that its social con¬ sequences have been correspondingly magnified. Burglary, hold¬ ups, robbery with murder, kidnaping, and mayhem are daily occurrences. There is so much moral degradation that even in the national penitentiary, where convicts are supposed to change for the better, the in mates turn their excess energies to “bust¬ ing” one another’s head and to escaping under the very noses of their guards. Apparently, iron bars do not make a prison, for those are used by the convicts precisely to escape to free¬ dom and to threaten society with their presence. Poverty has also given rise to a new class known as squatters. Social mobility during the last two decades has been from the rural areas to urban centers. Manila and other centers of po¬ pulation have seen this mobility and have become the focal points of this movement. The result is that the urban centers have become too small to accommodate the “immigrants.” The opportunities for marginal existence in the urban centers, gene¬ rated by the development of a miniature in dustrial complex, have been the primary factor in the movement. Since the urban communities lack sufficient housing facilities, the “immigrants” occupy public and private lots on which they build their frail barong-barongs. Such is the number of squatters that unscrupu¬ lous politicians, thinking only of the squatter votes, take up their cause and fight in court to protect the “rights” of the squatters to ignore the rights not only of the community, but also of private in dividuals. Many squatters, however, are not in digent people; they are well-to-do men who take advantage of of ficial laxness to stake their claims on public domain. When the latter is subdivided for sale to the public, the well-to-do squatters sell their “rights” to the highest bidder. The “immigrant” squatters have posed a problem to the community, for their houses are fire hazards and their surround¬ ings a threat to public health. More than the problem of safety and sanitation, however, is the moral problem in volved, for some squatters’ areas have been transformed into a paradise for women of easy virtues. The city of Manila, under its energetic 568 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE late Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson, partially solved the problem by relocating, with the help of the Social Welfare Administration, the squatters to areas provided for by the National Government. His successor, Mayor Antonio J. Villegas, courageously drove the squatters of the Walled City to the hinterland. The squatters on private property, who in dignantly refuse to vacate the private lots they illegally occupy, move over to another vacant lot or public property upon payment by the lot owner of a certain sum ranging from fifty to two hundred pesos.

The “fall” of the old agrarian aristocracy has been caused partly by the development of commerce and in dustry. Aggressive and, to a certain extent, imaginative men of the lower and middle classes have gone and are still going into commerce and in dustry with a perseverance never before witnessed. This group of men, or at least many of them, does not depend on the old way of thinking that one’s prestige depends on one’s “aristocratic” family background. The prestige they have built or are building depends on the concentration of wealth and power in their hands. These dimensions — wealth and power — have succeeded in pushing into the background the “aristo¬ cratic” families whose prestige lay in the possession of haciendas, the symbol of wealth and power from the Spanish times to the outbreak of the second World War. The abrupt changes in the economics of wealth and power occasioned by the last war caught the members of the landed aristocracy flatfooted and consequent¬ ly threw them out of gear. A few are adapting the mselves to the demands of the “new” economics’7 but the majority, either because they could not reconcile the mselves to the rise of the new rich or because of lack of in itiative, have been relegated to the background. 7 “New” economics is used here advisedly not in the Keynesian sense, but in the sense that the sources of wealth have shifted from the old agri¬ cultural to the commercial and in dustrial field. This is something new in so far as Philippine economy is concerned. THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 569 With the decay of the landed families, the aristocratic Spanish title Don, which precedes a name to denote the high class to which a man belongs, has become a misnomer. It is now used sparingly and only by those who, having fallen under the in flu¬ ence of the feudalists features of the Spanish period, have a hard time shaking off the nomenclature from their minds. Alta sociedad or high society is now mostly composed of traders, businessmen, and in dustrialists and their daughters and wives who spend most of their time in clubs. During the pre-war years, only daughters and sons of the landed aristocracy could become members of exclusive clubs; to day, membership in such club is open to those who, irrespective of family or igins and backgrounds, have the money to throw away. Thus, the “new” economics has partially, if not completely, democratized Filipino society. While the new bourgeoisie are acquiring wealth they are, at the same time, trying to win political power. This at tempt at political consolidation is being done in directly through polit¬ ical puppets, politicians who have risen from the lower and middle classes and who are in need of padrinos or sponsors to maintain their positions in the political in stitutions. This is not new, for even during the heyday of the landed aristocracy polit¬ ical puppets were common. The only change noted is in the puppet-politician’s shift of allegiance from the aristocracy to the new bourgeoisie. It is the duty of the puppet-politician to protect and to enhance the in terests of his padrino or the class to which the latter belongs. Failure to do so means with drawal of the padrino's support and, consequently, disaster for the politician. Quite recently, or since the elections of 1965, quite a number of new millionaires who have risen from below were elected to the Senate and the House of Representatives. It would be naive to suppose that they would not use their millions to pro¬ tect and advance their business in terests. Thus Congress is be¬ coming the paradise of plutocrats. Labor, meanwhile, is un¬ represented, although many lawmakers make it a point to de¬ liver speeches praising the laborers and making wild promises. The gathering wealth and power of the new bourgeoisie has not so far led, or at any rate is not yet leading, to the determination of national command decisions, although in a few in stances it may have had. The reason is that the process of consolidation is still going on and has not yet reached the point where the new bourgeoisie are too strongly entrenched for any group to oppose. 570 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The point will be reached when in dustrialization will have been fully developed and when, as a consequence, huge corporations or combinations will have risen to control or dictate the direction of the national economy and politics.

The immediate post-war years were years of conformism, of in difference even, when there was hardly a student voice raised against “special” relations with the United States, or against the rampant graft and corruption, or against the abuses of those in power. It was a period of re-adjustment after three years of suffering and hunger, and the students, concerned with how to continue their studies which were temporarily halted during the Japanese occupation, did not realize, or refused to realize, the magnitude of the national problems confronting the people. It was not until the late 1950 s that the Filipino students finally awakened to the dynamics of society and realized that it was their duty, no less than their elders’, to commit the mselves to the crucial questions vexing the leaders of the nation. Surprisingly, the first stirrings of an awakened social conscience were mani¬ fested in protests against the actuations of certain Americans who had not stopped believing that the Philippines was still a colony of the United States. But the protests, though clear, were not loud enough to at tract nation-wide at tention. It was in the early 1960 s that the students found the courage and the power to unite and to hold mass rallies and demon¬ strations not only against certain actuations of the Americans, but also against the behavior of some leaders in the government THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 571 who, the students felt, were not possessed of enough manliness to stand up to American importunities. By the second half of the 1960 s, the students had already decided to have a say in national affairs and in the affairs of their universities, colleges, and even their Church. Compared with students in Western countries, and even in Japan, those in the Philippines were “polite”: there had not been a case in which a mediocre professor or a simpering school administrator was stoned; there had not been any manhandling of lazy or arrogant in structor; there had not been any bloody affair that characterized some student demon¬ strations in Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Japan; and there had not been any battle with the police or constabulary no matter how abusive these may have been. The years from 1965 to 1972 witnessed the holding of massive student rallies, strikes, and demonstrations aimed at compelling those in author¬ ity to give in to their legitimate demands. These demands may be classified into (1) those relating to national and in ternational problems in which the Philippines was in volved; (2) those dealing with school administration; and (3) those dealing with reforms in the Catholic Church in the country. The growth of student power may be ascribed to (1) the in creasing student awareness that reforms in the social, political, and economic spheres of the country can be hastened by their commitment to those ideas which would re-structure society in such a way as to make it more egalitarian; (2) the in adequacy of those in power to come to grips with realities and their refusal or reluctance to share the responsibility in national development with the young whose realism is in fused with the idealism of youth; (3) the continuing crises in national life brought about by graft and corruption in high and low places and by the cynical at titude of those who continually speak about virtues and patriotism but subvert society by dishonest dealings and by going into smuggling; and (4) the failure of the older generation to appreciate the shift in the bases of a stable society of which the students form a significant segment. That the students mean to hold on to their new-found power is amply demonstrated by their in sistence in for cing the authorities and, in one in stance, the President of the Philippines,3 to accept their demands. 8 However, some student demonstrators broke the glass windows of the Lyceum of the Philippines (January 1969), the equipment of the Mapua Institute of Technology (February 1969), the equipment and some glass windows of the Far Eastern University (early September 1969), and the property of private firms with of fices at the Metropolitan Buildings in Makati perpetrated by Muslim demonstrators/who tried to destroy the Israeli Em^ bassy (August 1969). 30 v UNDER MARTIAL LAW The in creasing difficulties begetting the country and the failure of the successive administration to cope with the con¬ tinuing crises, especially in the socio-economic field, led to massive discontent that found eloquent expressions in student demon¬ strations. The late 1960 s and the beginning of the 1970 s saw the development of what has been termed student power. The “parliament of the streets,” as the student demonstrations were called, was basically anti-government and, generally speaking, negative in at titude. The violent demonstrations, supported in part by a segment of the laboring class, led to bloodshed and destruction of life and property.

The violence of the demonstrations and the frequency of their occurrence led at times to disruption of classes in the Greater Manila area and to clashes between the students, on the one hand, and the of ficers of the law, on the other. In the eyes of the government, the participants in the demonstrations had become unwieldy and uncontrollable. The death and destruction resulting from these clashes led to bitterness on the part of the students and to grave doubts of the government as to the noble aims of the demonstrators. Face with these disturbances and the rising power of Jose Ma. Sison’s Communist Party, President Ferdinand E. Marcos, availing himself of Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, issued Proclamation 1081 on September 21, 1972 which placed the entire country under martial law. In accordance with this proclamation, the President 572 UNDER MARTIAL LAW 573 to day rules by decrees, general or ders, and letters of in struction. In explaining why he declared martial law, President Marcos maintained that the danger of rebellion had in creased and that this danger had paralyzed the functions of the national and local gov¬ ernments. The productive sectors of the economy ground¬ ed to a halt. Many schools have closed down. The judiciary is unable to administer justice. Many of our businessmen, traders, in dustrialists, producers and manufacturers stopped their operations. In the Greater Manila area alone, tension and anxiety have reached a point where the citizens are compelled tp stay at home. Lawlessness and criminality like kidnapping, smuggling, extortion, blackmail, armed robbery, illegal traffic in drugs, gun- running, hoarding and manipulation of prices, corruption in government, tax evasion perpetuated by syndicated criminals, have in creasingly escalated beyond the capa¬ bility of the local police and civilian authorities. The President’s proclamation was met with silence by the people and the pessimist’s fear of a bloodbath did not materialize. To allay the people’s fear that the military might take over, Marcos emphasized, in a radio broadcast, that in placing the country under martial law, it was never his in tention to have the military take over the civil functions of the government. “The Government of the Republic of the Philippines which was established by our people in 1946 continues,” he said. “The of ficials and employees of our national and local governments continue in of fice...” In accordance with Proclamation 1081, President Marcos issued General Order 2-A or dering the Secretary of National Defense to arrest and detain persons who committed “crimes and of fenses in furtherance or on the occasion of our in cident to or in connection with the crimes of in surrection and rebellion” as defined in the Revised Penal Code, and those who, in one way or another, committed and will commit crimes against society and the government, such as those in volved in kidnapping, robbery, carnapping, smuggling, gun-running, trafficking of prohibited drugs and hijacking, tax evasion, price manipulation, and others guilty of weakening the fabric of society and of undermining the stability of the government. 574 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Initial Measures.—Having done away with the traditional politics which, in the past, had dissipated many at tempts by conscience-stricken legislators to improve the social and econom¬ ic condition of the masses, President Marcos moved swiftly to implement further his land reform program. In Presidential Decree No. 2, dated September 26, 1972, he proclaimed the entire Philippines as land reform area. Subsequently, he also decreed that tenants should be given three hectares of irrigated rice or com lands and five hectares, if unirrigated. The Depart¬ ment of Agrarian Reform was created to expedite the transfer of land titles to the peasants. The zealousness with which the agents of the Department of Agrarian Reform pursued their assigned tasks, sometimes too zealous for the comfort of some people affected by the agrarian reform, resulted in the transfer of many land titles to landless peasants. Realizing the importance of in creased production, especially of grains, President Marcos, on September 26, 1972, issued PD 4 providing for the creation of the National Grains Authority which was in tended to “effect the desired changes and reforms in the social, economic and political structure of society... Subsequently, when a crisis in rice and com occurred in 1973, the National Grains Authority took decisive steps to minimize the effects of the crisis and to regulate the distribution of the grains in such a way as to make the masses less open to the activi¬ ties of the hoarders, blackmarketeers, and manipulators of prices. To make the machinery of the government more responsive to the demands of the “New Society”, as the martial law regime is called, President Marcos issued PD No. 6, dated September 27, 1972, prescribing the rules and regulations regarding discipline in the government service. It was common knowledge that many government of ficials and employees who were doing nothing, were immoral, abusive, ignorant, and in efficient and as such led many to believe that the government existed in or der to exploit the people. The decree spelled out the grounds for disciplinary action against dishonesty, oppression, misconduct, negligence in the performance of duties, disgraceful and immoral conduct, discourtesy, and other misdemeanors which, in the old society, were ignored or passed over. The first year of the martial law regime saw a change in the behavior of the government of ficials and employees: prompt service, courtesy, efficiency, and good be¬ havior characterized most, if not all, government functionaries"

The first year of the martial law regime saw a change in the behavior of the government of ficials and employees: prompt service, courtesy, efficiency, and good be¬ havior characterized most, if not all, government functionaries. However, discipline during the second year of martial law dete- UNDER MARTIAL LAW 575 riorated and the old habits of in difference, in efficiency, dis¬ honesty. and other misdemeanors returned with a vengeance. People began to deplore the return of the old habits of thought and behavior and expressed privately that “happy days are here again” for the crooks in an outside the government. President Marcos was so scandalized by this development that not content¬ ing himself with expressing his sorrow, he moved briskly and publicly accepted the resignations of many of ficials and em¬ ployees whom he considered misfits or else guilty of dishonesty or in efficiency. Those who believed the mselves not guilty filed resolutions of reconsideration and, having been in vestigated, were reinstated to their positions when they were found in nocent. To minimize if not completely eradicate robbery and other unlawful activities at night, President Marcos also set curfew from midnight to four in the morning. Subsequently, it was changed from one to four in the morning. In some cases, curfew was lifted as, for in stance, during the celebration of All Saints’ Day and such occasions as necessitated activities beyond curfew hours. The New Constitution.-When martial law was declared, the Constitutional Convention, which had been meeting since the first week of June 1971 in or der to frame a new constitution to replace that of 1935, met on September 25, 1972 and “voted unanimously” to “continue deliberations on vital issues.” A motion was presented in the Convention to adjourn the plenary meeting until the lifting of martial law. The proposal was defeated. Consequently, the convention continued its sessions. When the new charter was finished, President Marcos referred it to the Citizens Assemblies numbering 26,000 all over the country. The Kapulungan or General Assembly of all citizens assemblies met from January 10 to 15, 1973 to consider the provisions of the new charter. Three questions were submitted to the Kapu¬ lungan, namely: (1) “Do you approve of the Citizens Assembly as a way of popular government to decide issues affecting our people?” (2) “Do you approve of the new Constitution?” and (3) “Do you want a plebiscite to be called to ratify the new Constitution?” The first two questions were overwhelmingly approved, while the third was overwhelmingly disapproved. In view of the results of the referendum, President Marcos, drama¬ tizing the occasion, signed three resolutions before the Kapulu¬ ngan: (1) Proclamation No. 1102 which announced the ratifica¬ tion by the Filipino people of the 1973 Constitution as of noon 576 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE of January 17, 1973; (2) Proclamation No. 1103 which declared the in terim National Assembly, provided for in Article XVII of the new Constitution, not convened; and (3) Proclamation No. 1104 which declared the continuation of martial law. The taking into effect of the new Constitution resulted in (1) the of ficial abolition of the legislative body; (2) the exercise by President Marcos of the powers of the President and of the Prime Minister; (3) the change of the form of government from presidential to parliamentary; and (4) the exercise by the Presi¬ dent of the power to call the in terim Assembly. Distribution of Wealth.—The obvious disparity in the dis¬ tribution of wealth in which the wealthy became wealthier and the poor poorer was one of the causes of discontent among the poor. Social stability was thus threatened and what Marxists call a “revolutionary situation” seamed to prevail in a society that was largely feudal. In or der to diffuse the growing dis¬ content which might erupt into an armed uprising or revolu¬ tion, President Marcos issued an or der urging business corpora¬ tions and companies to open their doors to the pubhc, which is to say, ownership of the corporations and companies should not be limited to the family circle and to a narrow circle of friends, but should be dispersed to those who were willing to become stockholders of such business firms. Meralco, which changed ownership, was now owned not by a few but by all Meralco customers. Some private companies and corporations followed suit and sold their stocks to the public. The effect was that wealth was to a degree being filtered to the traditional “have-nots,” mostly lower middle class. With regard to lands beyond seven hectares owned by a person, a decree provided for the distribution of land above seven hectares to landless tenants, and those who owned seven or less were required to till their lands personally. Otherwise, even their seven-hectare lands would be divided among the ten¬ ants upon just payment to the owners. The purpose behind this decree was to distribute lands as equitably as possible and so enlarge the middle class with the addition of the for mer tenants who, by dint of hard labor and patience, have improved their economic life. Peace and Order.~The disorders prevalent during premartial law period were conspicuously absent after the declaration of martial law. Curfew, as noted, was enforced strictly so that the UNDER MARTIAL LAW 577 usual nocturnal activities of lawless elements were minimized. The streets were now deserted and night clubs everywhere turned out their customers even before the approach of the curfew hour. In the provinces, similar peace-and-or der condition was noted, although in some distant areas sporadic fighting between the New People’s Army and the government for ces were known to have erupted"

The greatest threat to peace and or der came not from the NPA’s activities, which were not massive in nature, but from the so-called Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), of which a for mer political science student of the University of the Philippines is the alleged leader. Because of the casualties on both the government side and the Muslim secessionists, Pres¬ ident Marcos in itiated a truce movement in February, 1975 by appealing to the members of the ASEAN and to the Muslim countries to help force a ceasefire in the affected areas of Min¬ danao and Sulu. He of fered amnesty to all those connected with the secessionist movement and promised to bring the Muslims to the “level similar to the areas in Luzon...” For this purpose, the President set aside “plenty of money.” Five days later in Baguio, President Marcos said that the secessionist movement was “being abetted and sustained” by outside support. During the truce period, however, the MNLF at tacked the Philippine Constabulary for ces in Mindanao, resulting in heavy casualties. Displaying coolness and restraint, President Marcos continued to seek ways and means of having fruitful dialogue with the Muslim secessionists. He poured millions upon millions of pesos into the Muslim area to show his good in tentions as far as the development of the Muslim areas was concerned. At the same time, he in vited Muslim countries to in vestigate the condition of the Filipino Muslims in or der to determine for the mselves what his government was — and is still — doing to uplift the condition of the Muslim masses. President Marcos’s drive to win over the dissidents, Christians and non-Christians, won a significant victory when the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP), the Moscow-or iented communist group, volunteered to cooperate with the President. In a “Me¬ morandum of Cooperation” dated October 1, 1974, and signed by Felicisimo Macapagal, secretary-general of the PKP, the PKP said that “On the basis of your commitment to the in terests of the Filipino working people, we, Filipino communists, are ready to carry for ward the best elements of the New Society, from principles to deeds.” Thereupon President Marcos granted 578 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the PKP members safe conduct passes and directed that all assis¬ tance, ‘‘in cluding help civic action units, be given immediately to members of the PKP returning to the fold.” Thus ended the dissidence of the PKP which was founded in 1930 by the late Crisanto Evangelista. The campaign to have peace and or der prevail throughout the country in or der to create a favorable climate for economic and social development led not only to the voluntary promise of cooperation on the part of the PKP, but to the capture of Commander Dante (Bemabe Buscayno), head the NPA, the arm of the Peking-or iented Sison group of communists, and of Lt. Victor Corpus, who defected from the Philippine Army to the NPA years before. Dante was captured early in the morning of August 26, 1976 at a sitio of Mexico, Pampanga. Corpus, on the other hand, was captured as early as July, but the news of his capture was with held for security reasons. With the capture of Dante and Corpus, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (Peking-or iented) was considerably weakened. Infrastructure.—President Marcos, realizing the necessity for financial capability to underwrite his in frastructure program, decided to put teeth to tax laws which, in the past, had been ignored blithely or else circumvented in or der to avoid payment of correct in come tax. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, the biggest money maker, of all the departments of the government, and the Bureau of Customs, the second biggest money maker were placed in the hands of dedicated of ficials who were willing to run after prominent and in fluential tax payers. At the same time, Pres¬ ident Marcos issued a decree extending tax amnesty to those who, deliberately or not, failed to pay the correct amount of tax. The campaign to make the Filipinos conscious of their duty to pay correctly the amount they owed the government led to results beyond even the sanguine expectations of the tax col¬ lectors: tax collection rose precipitously to such heights never before known in the country’s history. The amount of back taxes paid by delinquent taxpayers who took advantage of the tax amnesty was almost a billion pesos. Substantial parts of this huge collection were spent in the construction of first-class roads, bridges, highways, irrigation facilities, airfields, improvement of airports, school-houses, tenement houses for the poor, improve¬ ment of Manila’s drainage and sewage, hospitals, dispensaries, and homes for the aged and the lepers, and public buildings to house government of fices. At no time in the history of the UNDER MARTIAL LAW 579 Philippines have in frastructures been given much importance as during the martial law regime. The Shift in Foreign Policy.—As has been noted in a pre¬ vious chapter, Philippine for eign policy since 1946 had been anchored principally on reliance on the United States, so much so that the late statesman, parliamentarian, poet, and nationalist, Claro M. Recto, described such a policy as “mendicant policy.” Recto severely criticized this mendicant policy and pleaded for an in dependent for eign policy which would do justice to Philippine sovereignty as an in dependent nation and to Filipino dignity"

Recto, described such a policy as “mendicant policy.” Recto severely criticized this mendicant policy and pleaded for an in dependent for eign policy which would do justice to Philippine sovereignty as an in dependent nation and to Filipino dignity. He pleaded for self-reliance, for it was not mete than in dependent country should not stand on its own feet but in stead rely almost exclusively on for eign, particularly American, aid. Even at the risk of being called communistic or a “fellow traveler,” Recto, imbued with high ideals and possessed of a seer’s in sight, fought for the non-recognition of Ngo Dinh Diem’s South Viet¬ nam, which Recto called a puppet of the United States, made the plea that the Philippines live with her neighbors, irrespective of ideology, as peacefully as circumstances allowed, and suggested a non-aligned posture in for eign affairs. A small country like the Philippines, he said, should hot take up the quarrels of the great nations. Recto for esaw the role China would play in world affairs and, especially Asian politics and suggested with rare courage that the Philippines live peacefully with her neighbors. But the prophet was not welcomed in his own country, and most Filipinos, laboring under the spell of colonial ment ality, considered his ideas chimerical. Twenty cr so years later, during the martial law regime, Recto’s ideas, too advanced for his time, became a reality. Pres¬ ident Marcos, grasping the significance of the new realities in in ternational politics, in itiated the shift in Philippine for eign policy when, on May 23, 1975, he delivered a for eign policy speech enumerating six guidelines “to help the country survive the current security crisis in Asia” arising from the American debacle in Vietnam. The guidelines are: 1. To in tensify, along with a broader field, Philippine rela¬ tions with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); 2. To pursue more vigorously the establishment of diplo¬ matic relations with the socialist states, particularly with the People’s Republic of China and with the Soviet Union; 580 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 3. To seek closer identification with the Third World (the so-called developing countries of the world); 4. To continue relationship with Japan; 5. To support the Arab countries in their struggle for a just and enduring peace in the Middle East; and 6. To find a new basis, compatible with the emerging realities in Asia, for a continuing healthy relationship with the United States. In accordance with these guidelines, the Philippines estab¬ lished diplomatic relations with socialist countries like East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, in 1973; Romania in April 1975; the People’s Republic of China on June 9, 1975; the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in August 1975; Jordan in March 1976; the Democratic Republic of Kampuchea (Cam¬ bodia) in May 1976; and with the Soviet Union on June 2, 1976. In December 1973, the Philippines ratified the long-pending Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation with Japan. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the socialist countries of Asia and Europe not only led to progressive trade relations between them and the Philippines, but also to cultural exchange programs. The of ficial relations with socialist countries marked the end of the Philippines’s period of mendicant policy in for eign affairs and the beginning of a new era of self-reliance and align¬ ment with the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and South America. History has vindicated Claro M. Recto. On the other hand, the Philippines, in December 1976, negoti¬ ated with the United States the “bases question”. The Philippine stand was that the United States shoulu pay rent for the right to use the bases, principally Clark Air Base and the Subic (Olongapo) Naval Base. While the United States favored giving economic and military aid to the Philippines in the amount of one billion dollars over a period of five years, the Philippines wanted rental fee - not aid for the use of the bases in the Philippines, the designation of a Filipino commander of the base with real powers and authority, the flying of the Filipino flag over the bases, and jurisdiction over of fenses committed on and off base. Labor and Human Welfare.—The martial law government has given importance to the role of labor in private and gov¬ ernment affairs and has, according to a high labor of ficial, “meta¬ morphosed [it] into a major objective of government economic policy.” The construction of roads, bridges, airports, and other UNDER MARTIAL LAW 581 forms of in frastructure led to in creased employment. In 1975, there were 15.2 million in the labor force, of whom 14.6 million or 96.2 per cent, were employed, while 577.6 thousands or 3.8 per cent, were unemployed. On the other hand, underemploy¬ ment remained at 9.2 per cent, of the to tal labor force. This performance was achieved in spite of the annual average of from 300,000 to 400,000 in crease in the ranks of labor. The Depart¬ ment of Labor’s agencies - the Overseas Employment Develop¬ ment Board (OEDB), the Public Employment Office (PEO), the National Seamen Board (NSB), the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC), and the Bureau of Apprenticeship (BA) are mainly responsible for the steady deployment of che labor force in such a way as to give the labor movement the importance it deserves. The Public Employment Office is res¬ ponsible for locating employment possibilities for job applicants in the domestic front, while the Overseas Employment Develop¬ ment Board is responsible for locating employment abroad. In 1975, the OEDB and the National Seamen Board successfully located for eign markets for skilled Filipino labor.

Filipino seamen, too, are in demand abroad because of their training and adaptability. In 1975, out of 54,487 seamen registered with the NSB, 23,543 were placed in for eign vessels. This figure does not in clude those directly hired by for eign- owned shipping lines. The effects of this employment abroad are, first, the lessening of the number! of unemployed in the country; second, the projection of the good image of the Filipino laborers, technicians, and professionals abroad; and finally, the in crease of the government’s in come made possible through the for eign exchange remittances of the workers and professionals working abroad. On the domestic front, the wages of laborers have been in¬ creased to P 10.00 a day in Metro Manila and P 9.00 outside Metro Manila, On the other hand, agricultural workers now receive (as of December 1976) P 7.00 for plantation workers and P 6.00 for non-plantation workers. Owing to the continued spiraling of prices arising from several factors, one of which was the con¬ tinued rise in the price of oil, the cost of living rose to such an extent as to affect adversely the workers and employees. Real¬ izing the plight of the salariedemploye. es, President Marcos, in August 1974, issued a decree compelling employers with a capital outlay of over one million pesos to give their employees an allow- 582 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE anee of P 50.00 a month; P 30.00 if the capital is not more than one million but more than one hundred thousand; and PI 5.00 if the capital is not more than one hundred thousand. Exception to compulsory payment of allowances were those employers in distress, that is to say, those in curring losses during the last three years and which, if compelled to pay allowances, would be for ced to close shop or to lay off fifty per cent of the employees. At almost the same time, President Marcos, realizing the crippling effects of in flation especially on the workers and the low-salaried employees, decreed that business firms must pay their employees a thirteenth-month bonus in or der to lighten their burden. In the field of labor relations, the government encouraged the for mation of the Trade Unions Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) in December, 1975, and recognized it as the restructuring agent of the Philippine labor movement. Some twenty-four labor federations were grouped under the TUCP with a to tal membership of about one million. The restructuring of the labor movement into one union-one in dustry policy will, it is hoped, lead to in dustry-wide collective bargaining. The Economy: Gains and Losses.—The recessionary tend¬ ency in 1975 all over the world affected the Philippines. Even so, the country has to date (1976) with stood the ill effects of the recessionary pressures and has maintained the growth rate of 1974. As a consequence, the Philippines recorded an economic gain of 5.8 per cent. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) estimated that the country in creased its gross national product (GNP) from P 40,847 million in 1974 to P 43,203 million in 1975. In gross capital for mation, the country posted a growth rate of 29.1 per cent, in 1975. Agriculture contributed a growth rate of 4.1 per cent, over 1974. This agricultural growth was explained as owing to the liberal credit policy of the govern¬ ment and to good weather conditions. In trade, however, the Philippines suffered some losses. The spiraling cost of oil imports and the lowering of the prices of traditional exports like sugar, copper and ore concentrates, ply¬ wood, coconut oil, logs and lumber, and abaca, led to a trade deficit of PI,164 million in 1975. This deficit is expected to in crease in 1976. The lowering of the price of sugar in the world market, with no hope of immediate relief, led the government to in crease the price of sugar for domestic consumption obviously to cushion the shock of the sugar in dustry’s debacle and to use UNDER MARTIAL LAW 583 sugar to manufacture alcohol which the government in tends to mix with gasoline in or der, first, to minimize the losses of the sugar in dustry and second, to economize on the use of gasoline and so save the country the much-needed dollars. Land Transfer and Leasehold-Three years after the land reform program under the martial law regime was in itiated, the yield per hectare planted to rice in creased by 40-45 per cent over that of the pre-martial law period. On the other hand, the gross in come of farmers in creased by almost one hundred per cent. On land transfers (from owners of lands more than seven hectares), some 365,000 hectares were transferred to 207,991 farmers as of November, 1975. Lands below seven hectares and placed under leasehold numbered 155,479 hectares with 122,420 farmers tilling the soil. The martial law regime also in itiated a resettlement program by which fanners with out lands were resettled in agricultural settle¬ ments owned by the government. The Department of Agriculture owns thirty-three agricultural settlements all over the country. As of the middle of 1976, some 47,712 farm-families had been resettled on 282,000 hectares. The average size of a farmlot is six hectares. Owing to the work of the Department of Agriculture, the settlement projects under the martial law regime have been markedly superior to those before the imposition of martial law.

Demonstrations against the “au¬ thoritarian’’ regime of Ferdinand Marcos escalated in in tensity and the “parliament of the streets” became common occurrences. To defuse the situation and to once again “legitimize” his pres¬ idency, Marcos called for snap presidential elections in February 1986. Marcos and his running mate, Arturo Tolentino, were proclaimed elected by the Batasang Pambansa, using as basis of ficial results issued by the Commission on Elections. The opposition LABAN candidates, Cory Aquino, widow of the assassinated leader, and Salvador Laurel, her running mate, con¬ tested the results of the election, claiming that massive fraud and terrorism were committed by the Marcos machinery. With the support of the in fluential Jaime Cardinal Sin and strong American pressure, especially coming from Congress and the State Depart¬ ment, Marcos was persuaded to yield power, thus avoiding what might have been a bloody confrontation between Marcos' mili¬ tary supporters and “people power.” People Power Revolt Marcos’ “superior or ganizational capability,” and machine politics delivered the elections to him, amidst revelations that violence and fraud marked election day. Marcos’ proclamation by the Batasang Pambansa on February 16 did not sound con¬ vincing to Cory supporters. Cory announced a program of eco¬ nomic boycotts and non-violent actions to dramatize her posture as the winner betrayed. Before Marcos could be in augurated President on February 25 th, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos announced their break with Marcos. Enrile was alarmed by reports of pending mass arrests of Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) of ficers and opposition leaders, which he preempted by gathering some 400 of his men in defensive positions at Camp Aguinaldo. Enrile sought Cardinal Sin’s support and thousands of people responded to the Cardinal’s appeal for “our two good friends” 584 585 THE EDSA “REVOLUTION” and began massing outside the rebel camps on EDSA. An estim¬ ated one to two million people converged on Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo, immobilizing the military counter-force that was or dered by Gen. Fabian Ver, Marcos’ Chief of Staff, to neutralize the military rebellion. For four days, from February 22 nd to 25 th, 1986, “people power” supported the Enrile-Ramos rebellion which in creasingly declared support for Cory Aquino. On February 25 th, Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel were sworn in as President and Vice-President, respectively, by Supreme Court Justice Claudio Teehankee. Enrile was named Defense Minister in the new government and Ramos became Armed Forces Chief of Staff. On the same day, at noon, Ferdinand Marcos took his oath of of fice in ceremonies at Malacanang Palace, at tended by several thousand flag-waving loyalists. Marcos’s running mate, Tolentino, failed to at tend the in augural. That evening, Marcos could no longer hold on in the midst of people power support for the new government of Cory Aquino. LTnder pressure from US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth and the US government to step down in or der to avoid violence, Marcos and his family left the Palace, accompanied by General Ver and a small number of close supporters and their personal staff. They were taken to Clark Air Base en route to Hawaii. As news of Marcos’ flight spread, crowds converged on the palace grounds, chanting “Cory! Cory! Cory!” and “It’s Libera¬ tion Day!” As the palace gates were thrown open, thousands charged into the compound. Some looting was reported but by midnight, tens of thousands gathered all over the city to pray, cheer, and celebrate. The four days of the February “Revolution” were marked by the outpouring of love, anger, hysteria and courage by a people desiring for change or renewal. Amidst the euphoria which ac¬ companied the rejection of Marcos, restoration of the nation had to be undertaken. After EDSA: The Revolutionary Interlude President Aquino proceeded to establish a revolutionary gov¬ ernment under the terms of a “Freedom Constitution” which legally established the structure of government, pending the adoption of a democratically-drafted constitution for Cory’s “Bagong Demokrasya.” The new leadership reorganized the government — it abolished the Batasang Pambansa controlled 586 HISTORY OF THE FIUPINO PEOPLE largely by Marcos loyalists; it appointed new Supreme Court justices; and it replaced Marcos appointees with of ficers-in-charge (OICs).

The Constitutional Imperative; Problems To ensure the stability of government, the Aquino adminis¬ tration appointed a Constitutional Commission in late 1986 to draft a new Constitution. The Constitution thus drafted, which replaced the “Freedom Constitution,” was ratified on February 7, 1987. The congressional and local elections that followed set up the mechanism of governance based on popular and demo¬ cratic mandate. Stability was elusive for a while. Marcos loyalists continued to oppose the government, culminating in an at tempt, in July 1987, to establish a rival government at the Manila Hotel, with Arturo Tolentino as temporary president. This coup failed to unsettle the government. The more serious threat to the new government came from an at tempted coup in August 1987 led by Col. Gregorio Honasan, who had followed Juan Ponce Enrile in his break with Marcos in February 1986. Rumors of coups or a take-over of the govern¬ ment by opposition elements persist, and this plus the tremendous problems of moral and economic recovery, the NPA and MNLF in surgencies, in competence and in efficiency, graft and corruption, and the bases issue continue to confront the Aquino government. ^ ^. y ^ ^ v ^ ^ SELECTED REFERENCES CHAPTER II There are numerous reading materials on the subjects discussed in this chapter, most of which are for specialists. The following, however, contain less barbarous terms than many works on the subjects and may the refore be read by the uninitiated with much profit: Prof. H. Otley Beyer’s “Early History of Philippine Rela¬ tions With Foreign Countries, Especially China,” being an in tro¬ duction to E. Arsenio Manuel’s Chinese Elements in the Tagalog Language (Manila, 1948). This latter work is very helpful in so far as Chinese-loan words in Tagalog are concerned, but some of its conclusions should be taken with a grain of salt. Beyer’s “The Philippines Before Magellan,” Asia Magazine, October and November 1921, is helpful and throws light on some aspects of Philippine history before Magellan in truded into the Philip¬ pine scene. Beyer and Jaime C. de Veyra’s Philippine Saga (Manila, 1947) has a fine summary of pre-Spanish Philippines. Najeeb M. Saleeby’s “The Origin of the Malayan Filipinos,” Papers of the Philippine Academy, Volume I, Part I (Manila, 1912), contains important facts on the or igin and ancient religions of the early Filipinos. T. H. Pardo de Tavera’s El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog (Paris, 1887) lists Tagalog words of Sanskrit or igin. His the ory of direct Indian-Filipino contact looks fishy, however. J. Gonda’s scholarly work, Sanskrit in Indonesia (Nagpur, 1952), traces words of Sanskrit or igin in the Philippine and other Aus- 588 SELECTED REFERENCES 589 tronesian languages. Juan R. Francisco’s “Indian Influences in the Philippines”, in Philippine Social Sciences and Humanities Review (Quezon City, University of the Philippines), Vol. XXVIII, Nos. 1-3, January-September 1963, may be read with profit, but the reader is warned to tread lightly for it has some manholes. Some aspects of Philippine-Chinese relations are discussed in Berth old Laufer’s “The Relations of the Chinese to the Philip¬ pine Islands,” Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Volume 50, Part 2, Publication No. 1734. Those in terested in pursuing the subject further may consult the following: Hirth and Rock- hill’s translation, Chau Ju-kua: His work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the 12 th and 13 th Centuries, entitled “Chu-fanchi” (St. Petersburg, 1911). Chau Ju-kua’s work is also found in Volume 34 of Blair and Robertson, in the Revista Historica de Filipinas, No. 12, in the Periodico Hebdomadario Escolar, November S, 1901, and in an edition by Paul Stangl. Still on the same subject, W. W. Rockhiil’s translation of Wang Ta-yuan’s Tao-i-chih-lio, the or iginal of which was published in 1349, is valuable. It is reprinted in Craig and Benitez’s Philippine Progress Prior to 1898 (Manila, 1916). A good description of Chinese pottery in the Philippines is found in Fay-Cooper Cole’s Chinese Pottery in the Philippines (Chicago, 1912). On this subject, the recent Calatagan discoveries are important. They are found in Robert B. Fox’s “The Calatagan Excavations,” Philippine Studies, Volume 7, No. 3, August 1959, and in the same author’s The Philippines in Pre-Historic Times (Manila, 1959). A popular work on for eign in fluences in Tagalog is Teodoro A. Agoncillo’s “Our National Language,” The Herald Magazine, March 28, 1953. On similarities between Philippine and Indian customs and costumes, Tara Ali Baig’s “Sisters Under the Skin,” Saturday Mirror Magazine, October 2, 1954, is very enlightening. Dhirendra Nath Roy’s The Philippines and India (Manila, 1930) contains some observations on similarities between Indian and Philippine customs and superstitions.

On races in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, the following may be consulted: Manuel Anton’s articles in the section “Antro- pologia,” in Exposicion Filipina (Madrid, 1887), H. Otley Beyer’s Population of the Philippine Islands in 1916 (Manila, 1916), David Barrows’ article in the Census of 1903, Volume I, Ferdinand Blu- ment ritt’s “List of Native Tribes,” Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1897, Rudolf Virchow’s “The Peopling of the Philip¬ pines,” reprinted in Craig’s The Philippines Through Foreign Eyes (Manila, 1916), and a few others, such as Alfred Wallace, L. R. Sullivan, Montano, Sanchez, Hose and Mc Dougal, and Baring- Gould and Bampfylde, whose works are difficult to come by in the Philippines to day. CHAPTER III Philippine culture before the coming of the Spaniards has been described by many authors, particularly Spanish. The most important ones, considered as standard references, are Francisco Colin’s Labor Evangelica (Madrid, 1663), edited and annotated by Pablo Pastells (Barcelona. 1900-1902) in three volumes; the English version of Colin is found in Blair and Robertson’s The Philippine Islands (Cleveland, 1903-1908), Volume 40; Juan de Plasencia’s Las Costumbres de los Tagalos (ca. 1589), in Blair and Robertson, Volume 7; Miguel de Loarca’s Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, in Blair and Robertson, Volume 16. Another English version, the first, is found in Sir Henry of Alderley (Henry E. J. Stanley), published in London in 1868 as a volume in the Hakluyt Society Series. Rizal’s edition of Morga (1890) is in ferior to that of Retana. The works of such priests as Santa Ines, Delgado, San Agustin, and others, are helpful but not easily available. For available secondary sources, Josue Soncuya’s Historia Pre- Hispana de Filipinas (Manila, 1917) is good; it d^cusses the early history and customs of the Visayans, particularly those of the island of Panay. A brief but perceptive study of the ancient SELECTED REFERENCES 591 Filipino culture and society is found in Robert B. Fox’s “Pre¬ historic Foundations of Contemporary Filipino Culture and Society,” Comment, First Quarter, No. 5, 1958, and in the same author’s The Philippines in Pre-Historic Times. For an anthro¬ pological approach to Filipino culture, see F. Landa Jocano’s “Rethinking Filipino Cultural Heritage,” in Lipunan, Vol. 1, No. 1 (1965), pp. 53-71. The same author’s Questions and Challenges in Philippine Prehistory (Quezon City, University of the Philip¬ pines, 1975) disputes Beyer’s the ory of Malay migrations to the Philippines and sets forth his own the ory. Jocano’s the ory appears to have a better basis than the hitherto accepted the ory of the late H. Otley Beyer. The early religions of the Filipinos are dis¬ cussed in Isabelo de los Reyes’ La Religion Antigua de los Fili¬ pinos (Manila, 1909); Fernando Blumentritt’s “Diccionarxo Mitologico, ” in Retana’s Archivo del Bibliofilo Filipino (Madrid, 1896), Volume 2; and Sor Edmunde Delbeke’s Religion and Morals of the Early Filipinas at the Coming of the Spaniards (Manila, 1928). A popular work on the Muslim marriage customs is found in Ileana Maramag’s “Muslim Courtship and Wedding Customs,” The Manila Times, Section B, October 5, 1959. The in troduction of Islam in the Philippines is discussed in Najeeb Saleeby’s The History of Sulu (Manila, 1908) and Studies in Moro History, Law, and Religion (Manila, 1905). CHAPTER IV There are several good books on Malayo-Polynesian languages, but the best in troductory volume is Renward Brandstetter’s An In¬ troduction to Indonesian Linguistics (trans. C. O. Blagden, Lon¬ don, 1916). The Institute of National Language made a study of the Austronesian and Philippine languages entitled Preliminary Studies on the Lexicography of the Philippine Languages (Manila, 1937), Volume I, Nos. 1-10. On the ancient Filipino syllabary and the system of writing, the works of Colin, Chirino, and Morga are in dispensable. Those who would like to go into the in tricacies of the ancient Filipino writing may consult not only Morga, Chirino and Colin, but also Cipriano Marcilla’s Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos (Malabon, 1895), T. H. Pardo de Tavera’s Consideracidn para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos (Losana, 1884), Pedro Andres de Castro’s Ortografia y reglas de la lengua Tagalog (Manila, 1776), and Ignacio Villa- mor’s La Antigua Escritura Filipina (Manila, 1922). There are scores of other books, from Mallat to Mas, which in clude samples of the ancient Filipino writing but most of them are superficial. 592 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE On Tagalog literature, Epifanio de los Santos’ “Nuestra Li- teratura a traves de los siglos, ” in M. M. Norton’s Builders of a Nation (Manila, 1914), the same author’s Literatura Tagala (Ma¬ drid, 1909), and Teodoro A.

Filipino folklore is dis¬ cussed in Isabelo de los Reyes’ El Folklore Filipino (Manila 1899) and in Dean S. Fansler’s Filipino Popular Tales (Lan¬ caster and New York, 1921). As a bibliographic guide on Philip¬ pine folklore, E. Arsenio Manuel’s Philippine Folklore Biblio¬ graphy (Quezon City, 1965) may be consulted. On the songs and musical in struments of the ancient Filipinos, Alfredo N. Munoz’s “Play a Native Melody,” The Saturday Mirror Magazine, February 26, 1955, F. Sionil Jose’s “Manners and Morals in Igoro Hand,” Sunday Times Magazine, January 26, 1958, and Wenceslao E. Retana’s El Indio Batangueho (3 rd ed., Manila, 1888) should be consulted. A glimpse at Maranaw literature may be had in Abdullah T. Madale’s “The Literature of the Maranaws,” This Week, February 22, 1959. On Filipino primitive art, H. Otley Beyer’s “Filipino Art and Culture in pre- Spanish Times,” mimeographed, Galo B. Ocampo’s “Evolution of Philippine Art,” This Week, September 6, 1959 and A. V. H. Hartendorp’s two articles, “Ifugao Wood Carving” and “The Art of the Lanao Moros,” The Philippines Quarterly, September 1951 and September 1953, respectively, are probably the best on the subject. CHAPTERS V AND VI For a background on Spanish colonial policy, William Ro- scher, The Spanish Colonial System (translated from the German into English, 1903; reprinted in New York, 1944), is a must. Sources for an enlightenment on the Renaissance period, in clude SELECTED REFERENCES 593 J. R. Hale, Renaissance Europe; Individual and Society, 1480- 1520 (New York, 1971) and Hugh Thomas, A History of the World (New York, 1979). One should not miss reading the scholarly work on the Recon¬ naissance and Maritime Discovery in Boies Penrose, Travel and Discovery in the Renaissance, 1420-1620 (New York, 1962), supported by the in for mative* maps in Carlos A. Quirino, Philip¬ pine Cartography (Manila, 1959). For a backgrounder on Spain in the Philippines, Nicholas Cushner, Spain in the Philippines; From Conquest to Revolu¬ tion (Quezon City, 1971), gives a brief, but substantial account from the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16 th century to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. Sources in Span¬ ish on the expeditions of Magellan, Loaisa, Saavedra, Villalobos and Legazpi, have been updated by a more modern work also using in controvertible primary sources in J. Ignacio Rubio Mane, “La expedicion de Miguel Lopez de Legazpi a Filipinas,” appear¬ ing in Vol. V, nos. 3-4 (July-Dectmber, 1964) of the Boldin del Archivo de la Nacion (Mexico). For a quick handy guide to all the significant voyages of exploration, Nicholas P. Cushner, The Isles of the West; Early Spanis 1 Voyages to the Philippines (Quezon City, 1966), easily describes them all in one volume. The Beginnings of Christianity in the Philippines (Manila, 1965), a compilation of selected papers read at a historical symposium sponsored by the Philippines Historical Committee and the Philip¬ pine Chapter of the International Association of Historians of Asia. T. V Sitoy, Jr., A History of Christianity in the Philip¬ pines; the Initial Encounter, 1542-1546 (Quezon City, 1985), Vol. I, contains several in teresting new in sights on the early Spanish voyages of discovery, as seen by a Filipino writer. The scholarly work on the structure of the Spanish colonial government is undoubtedly that of Charles H. Haring, The Spanish Empire in America (New York, 1963), strengthened in somt areas, by Onofre A. Corpuz, The Bureaucracy in the Philippines (Manila, 1957) and Eliodoro G. Robles, The Philippines in the 19 th Cen¬ tury (Quezon City, 1969). The classic work on the Manila-Acapulco trade is still William L. Schurz, The Manila Galleon (New York, 1959) which may be reinforced by studies on galleon movements in the 16 th to the 18 th centuries by Pierre Chaunu Les Philippines et le Pacifique 594 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE des Iberiques (Paris, 1960). The lasting cultural effects of the trade are discussed excellently in Silvio Zavala, El mundo ameri- cano en la epoca colonial (2 v., Mexico, 1967) and Rafael Bernal, Prologue to Philippine History (Manila, 1967). The scholarly treatise on the Royal Philippine Company remains Maria Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo, La Real Compahia de Fi- lipinas (Seville, 1965) which recounts the rise and fall of the company from 1785 to 1834, although James F. Cloghessy, “The Philippines and the Royal Philippine Company,” Mid-Ame¬ rica 42 (1960), pp. 88-104, is also useful.

Leoncio Gonzales Liquete’s delightfully in for mative, almost unused articles on Philippine economic history by Filipino and for eign historians are found in his Repertorio historico, biografico y bibliografico; colleccion de obras publicadas hasta el presente en la prensa de Manila (3 v., Manila, 1930). Two brief analytical works on Philippine economy during the Spanish regime, undoubtedly, are Benito Legarda, Jr.’s “The Philippine Economy under Spanish Rule,” Solidarity 11/10 (November-December, 1967), and Horacio de la Costa’s “Nineteenth Century” in Progress (1957) and “Philippine Economic Development” in his Asia and the Philippines (Manila, 1967). The almost unknown Salem-Manila trade is discussed in Nathaniel Bowditch, Early American-Philippine Trade, 1796 (New Haven, Conn., 1962), supported by Isagani R. Medina, “American Logbooks and Journals in Salem, Massachusetts on the Philippines, 1796-1894,” Asian Studies (April, 1973). Works on the vicissitudes of the Filipino clergy should start with Horacio de la Costa, “The Development of the Native Clergy SELECTED REFERENCES 595 in the Philippines,” in Gerald H. Anderson, (ed.), Studies in Philippine Church History (Ithaca, 1969) and pertinent portions, in John Schumacher, Readings in Philippine Church History (Quezon City, 1979). The Filipino-centric view which rectifies some earlier findings of De la Costa and Schumacher on the early Filipino priests, are presented in Luciano P. R. Santiago, The Hidden Light: the First Filipino Priests (Quezon City, 1987). The persistent irritating problems of haciendas are fully discussed in Dennis M. Roth, The Friar Estate of the Philippines (Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1977) and Nicholas Cushner, Landed Estates in the Colonial Philippines (New Haven, 1976). The Cavite Mutiny of 1872 can best be understood by reading Leandro Tormo Sanz’s two works: 1872; Documents Compiled and Annotated (Manila, 1973) and “La huelga del Arsenal de Cavite en 1872,” (Seville, 1978). The Filipino-centric view on the survey of education during the Spanish regime is discussed in the classic work of Encamacion Alzona, A History of Education in the Philippines, 1565-1930 (Manila, 1932); Dalmacio Martin, (ed.) “A Century of Education in the Philippines, 1861-1961,” (Manila, 1980), and Domingo Abella, “State of Higher Education in the Philppines to 1863; a Historical Reappraisal,” Philippine Historical Review 1/1 (1965), pp. 1-46. Jose Rizal, “The Town Schools in the Philippines,” in his Miscellaneous Writings (Manila, 1964), gives a perspective never found in other works of the same nature.

The records are found in the National Archives of the Philippines, Spanish Records Section in the record group labeled Sediciones y rebeliones. The “Conspiracy of the maharlikas of 1587-88” is lengthily treated in the “Conspiracy against the Spaniards, May-July, 596 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 1589,” in Blair and Robertson, vol. 7, pp. 95-111. The “In¬ surrections by Filipinos in the Seventeenth Century” that is, from the armed resistance of the Gaddangs (1621) to the Zam- bals (1683), are found in vol. 38, pp. 87-240, of Blair and Ro- berston, culled from various accounts written by early Spanish friar chroniclers. Sumodoy’s revolt is best described in Ignacio Alzina, “Description of the Towns of Sulat, Tubig, Bobon and Catarman and of the Palapag Uprising in 1649,” Philippiniana Sacm 17/49 (January-April, 1982), pp. 123-85; 17/50 (May- August, 1982), p. 106. Of course, one should not miss Cantius J. Kobak, “Historical Survey of Palapag, Samar, and the Sumoroy Rebellion of 1649,” Ley te-Samar Studies 2/1 (1968), pp. 44-91. Augmenting the religious chroniclers on Filipino revolts are the secular historians like Jose Montero y Vidal Historia general de Filipinas (3 v., Madrid, 1887-1895), and by contemporary writers, Felix H. Keesing, The Ethnohistory of Northern Luzon (Stanford, 1962) for the armed uprisings in the Cordilleras and Cesar Majul, Muslims in the Philippines (Quezon City, 1973) and Samuel K. Tan, “Sulu under American Military Rule, 1899-1913,” Phil¬ ippine Social Sciences and Humanities Review 32/1 (March, 1967), pp. 6-20, ior the protracted “Moro Wars.” The not so well-known revolts of Magtangaga, Caragay, and Rivera are described in Fathers Domingo Collantes, Historia de la provincia del Sanusimo Rosario de Filipinas (Manila 1783), Julian Malumbres, Historia de Cagayan and Historia de Isabela (Manila, 1918), and of course, corroborated and supplemented by Juan Ferrando, Historia de los pp. Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas (6 v., Madrid, 1870-72). Palaris’ revolt is best described in Jose S. Arcilla, “The Pangasinan Uprising, 1762-1765,” Philip¬ pine Historical Review IV (1971), pp. 32-52. For sources on Silang’s revolt, the Augustinian Fr.

SELECTED REFERENCES 597 For the peasant revolt in Silang, Cavite, led by Joseph de la Vega in 1745, the “Diligencias fhas. sobre la revelion (sic) tumul- tuaria de los yndios del pueblo de Silan y de otros,” dated April 28, 1745, found at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Spain (AGI, Filipinos, 288), and the copies of documents at the Do¬ minican archives in San Juan, Metro Manila, are the principal primary sources as “The Revolt of 1745,” found in Roth, The Friar Estates (1977), pp. 100-16 and Artigas, Historia de Fili¬ pinos (1912). The Luis Parang and Juan Up ay’s agrarian up¬ rising in Cavite in 1822 and the Eduardo Camerino — led revolt in the mid-1860 s, are discussed in Isagani R. Medina, “La madre de los ladrones; tulisanismo in Cavite in the Nineteenth Century,” Philippine Social Sciences Review (January-December, 1984), pp. 215-289. Irene Collins, “Liberalism in Nineteenth-Century Europe,” in E. C. Black, European History, 1815-1870 (New York, 1967) is a “must” reading. Carlos Maria de la Torre and his alleged liberal policy which culminated later in the Cavite Mutiny of 1872, can be best understood, if one reads his Manifiesto al pais sobre los sucesos de Cavite (Madrid, 1872); Manuel Artigas y Cuerva, Los sucesos de 1872 (Manila, 1911); Edmond Plauchut, “The Cavite Uprising of 1872,” Philippine Historical Bulletin IV/4 (December, 1960), pp. 1-16, which is the English translation of his La algarada caviteha de 1872 (Manila, 1916) or iginally published in French; and John N.

CHAPTER VIII Readings for this chapter are numerous, some of which are either not available or are difficult to come by. Only the most important are in dicated here. For Rizal’s life, Rafael Palma’s Biografia de Rizal (English translation The Pride of the Malay Race by Roman Ozaeta) and Leon Ma. Guerrero, Jr.’s The First Filipino (Manila, 1963) are the best. For a short biography of Lopez Jaena, the best are Mariano Ponce’s “Graciano Lopez Jaena”, in Efemerides Filipinos (Manila, 1914), and Jaime C. De Veyra’s “Graciano Lopez Jaena: Estudio Biogrdfico ”, in the re¬ issue of Discursos y articulos various (Manila, 1951). Anecdotes about Lopez Jaena are found in Jose Alejandrino’s The Price of Freedom (Manila, 1949). On the life of Marcelo H. del Pilar, 598 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE the following may be consulted: Epifanio de los Santos, “Mar- celo H. del Pilar,’ Revista Filipina, June 1920; and Teodoro A. Agoncillo, “Marcelo H. del Pilar: A Challenge and a Symbol,” Philippine Review, August 1944, and Magno Gatmaitan, Marcelo H. del pi/ar. 1850-1896 (Quezon City, Munoz Press, 1966). Del Pilar’s pamphlets are difficult to come by, but some of them are reprinted in E. de los Santos’ essay ment ioned above. Copies of La Solidaridad are now very rare, but a discussion of the period¬ ical is found in Jesus Z. Valenzuela’s History of Journalism in the Philippine Islands (Manila, 1933) and in Mariano Ponce’s ‘La Solidaridad”, in Efemirides Filipinas. For Masonry and its role, Teodoro M. Kalaw’s La Masoneria Filipinas (Manila, 1920) is the best. This work was translated into English and published in 1955 under the title Philippine Masonry. Teodoro A. Agoncillo’s The Revolt of the Masses: The Story of Bonifacio and the Katipunan (Quezon City, 1956) was used heavily in this chapter. CHAPTER IX This chapter is to a large extent a resume of several chapters of Agoncillo’s The Revolt of the Masses... For important refer¬ ences, see bibliography of this book. CHAPTER X The substance of this chapter has been culled from Agoncillo’s Revolt of the Masses... and from l^lalolos: The Crisis of the Republic (Quezon City, 1960). On some documents concerning the Katipunan and its discovery, W. E. Retana’s Archivo del Bibliofilo Filipino (Madrid, 1891), Volume 3, is probably the best. Care, however, should be taken in reading the testimonies of the witnesses, for they had been taken at the point of the bayonet. On the battles fought, Manuel Sastron's La Insurrecci Sn en Fili¬ pinas (Madrid, 1897), Vol I, represents the Spanish viewpoint. Most of Sastron’s data were taken from newspaper reports gather¬ ed and published by R. Guerrero under the title Cronica de la Guerra de Cuba y de la Rebelion de Filipinas (Barcelona, 1896- 1897), in five volumes. Volumes 4 and 5 deal with the revolu¬ tion in the Philippines. A first-hand in for mation on the Revolu¬ tion (1896-1898) is found in Carlos Ronquillo’s Paghihimagsik nang 1896-97, still in manuscript form. SELECTED REFERENCES 599 The documents on the trial of Bonifacio and others accused of sedition and treason are in the Philippine Insurgent Records, but an English translation is found in Teodoro A. Agoncillo’s’ 77 ie Writings and Trial of Andres Bonifacio (Manila, 1963). On the Truce of Biyak-na-bato, the best are Pedro A.

The events leading to the Truce and its final outcome are dis¬ cussed in Agoncillo’s Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic. For the Filipino viewpoint, General Aguinaldo’s Reseha Veridica de la Revolucion Filipina (Tarlak, 1899) should be read. CHAPTER XI The contents of this chapter have been culled from Agoncillo’s Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic. Most of the sources are doc¬ umentary and are found in the Philippine Insurgent Records. For Aguinaldo’s version of his conferences with Pratt, Wildman, and Dewey, see his Reseha Veridica... For the American viewpoints, see Dewey’s Autobiography (New York, 1913) and Pratt’s and Wildman’s letters to the State Department in Senate Document No. 62, Part I, 55 th Congress, 3 rd. Session. For eyewitness accounts of the battle of Manila, August 13, 1898, see F. D. Millet’s The Expedition to the Philippines (New York, 1899), Jesse George’s Our Army and Navy in the Orient (Manila, 1899), and the articles in cluded in Marion Wilcox’s Harper’s History of the War in the Philippines (New York and London, 1900). CHAPTERS XII AND XIII The substance of these chapters has been culled from Agon¬ cillo’s Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic, the documentary sources of which are found in the Philippine Insurgent Records. On the American version of the Filipino-American hostilities, the best sources are the various Reports of the Major-General Command¬ ing the Army (Washington, 1899-1902). Care, however* should be taken in reading these reports, particularly with reference to the battles fought, for many of the reports had been tailored to suit the authorities in Washington. Wilcox’s Harper’s History of the War.,. contains valuable in for mation on the different phases of the conflict. So far, no extensive Filipino account of the armed conflict has been written and published. General Venancio Concepcion’s diaries, Apuntes y Diario de Operaciones, are no 600 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE « longer available and only parts of the whole were available to a few scholars before the last war. Other sources, mainly American, are the following: Karl Irving Faust’s Campaigning in the Philip¬ pines (San Francisco, 1899, Albert G. Robinson’s The Philip¬ pines, the War and the People (New York, 1901), Frederick Funston’s Memories of Two Wars (New York, 1911), and Senate Document No. 331, three volumes (Washington, 1902). CHAPTER XIV The sources for the writing of the Aglipayan Movement are abundant, but most of them are not readily available. Those easily available are Juan A. Rivera’s “The Aglipayan Movement,” The Philippine Social Science Review, Vol. 9, No. 4, December 1937, and Francis H. Wise’s The History of the Philippine Independent Church (Master’s Thesis, University of the Philippines, 1954). Some of the documents which deal with the Filipino national church and the second phase of the Revolution are found in the Philippine Insurgent Records. A few of these documents are in cluded in Teodoro M. Kalaw’s edition of Mabini’s La Revo- lucion Filipina con otros documentos de la epoca (Manila, 1931), volume 2. For the biographies of Aglipay and Isabelo de los Reyes, see Manuel Artigas y Cuerva’s Galeria de Filipinos Ilustres (Manila, 1917), Volume I, and Jose L. Llanes’ “Life and Labors of Isabelo de los Reyes,” The Diliman Review, U. P. Golden Jubilee Number, April-December 1958. Pedro S. de Achutegui, and Miguel A. Bernad’s, both Jesuits, Religious Revolution in the Philippines (Manila, 1960), Vol. I, may be consulted with caution. Another biography by a Spanish Augustinian is Isacio Rodriguez’s Gregorio Aglipay y los Origines de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente (1898-1917), Madrid, 1960), Naturally, it is pro-Spanish. Another biography of Isabelo de los Reyes is found in Jose de los Reyes* Biography of Senator Isabelo de los Reyes... (Manila, 1947). The religious question is ably presented in the second volume of James A. Le Roy’s The Americans in the Philippines (Boston and New York, 1914). The documents relating to the early Aglipayan Movement were published in the periodical edited by I. de los Reyes, La Iglesia Filipina Independiente, 1903-1904. Some of the historical aspects of Aglipayanism are found in Manuel Lagasca’s Iglesia Filipina Independiente: Su or igen, significacion e importancia (Manila, 1939).

CHAPTER XVI The other side of American military rule, which was marked by Filipino compromise and cooperation, is treated in both 602 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE American and Filipino sources. The following may be useful for in sight into the non-revolutionary type of Filipino reaction: George Taylor’s The United States and the Philippines: Problems of Partnership (Praeger, 1964) which presents the mutuality of in terests and benefits American rule brought to the colony in a historical perspective; J.

Agoncillo’s “The Development of the Tagalog Language and Literature” and in his draft of a work on the American in fluence on the Tagalog literature and language. CHAPTER XXI There is a plethora of or iginal sources on the Japanese occu¬ pation; only the most salient, however, are in dicated here. The best sources are easily the occupation Tribune and the Official Journal of the Japanese Military Administration Manila, 1942- 1943), 13 volumes. Theodore Roosevelt’s role in the Philippine in dependence program is found in Henry F. Pringle’s Theodore Roosevelt (Harvest Books, New York, 1956); General Douglas Mac-Arthur’s role is found in Francis Trevelyan Miller’s General Mac Arthur (Philadelphia, 1945) and in Douglas Mac Arthur’s Reminiscences (New York, 1964). The series of events leading to the war is found in the newspaper accounts, principally in the Manila Tribune and the Manila Daily Bulletin, 1940-1941. The military side is ably presented in Louis Morton’s The Fall of the Philippines (Washington, 1953). Manuel L. Quezon’s The Good Fight (New York and London, 1946) presents the Filipino view¬ point of the war. Critical accounts of the occupation years are found in Hernando Abaya’s Betrayal in the Philippines (New York, 1946) and Eliseo Quirino’s A Day to Remember (Manila, 1958). A defense of the role of some Filipino of ficials during the occupation is masterfully presented in Claro M. Recto’s Three Years of Enemy Occupation: The Issue of Political Colla¬ boration in the Philippines (Manila, 1946). The senior author has written a two-volume work, The Fateful Years: Japan’s Adventure in the Philippines, 1941-1945 (Quezon City, 1965), Jorge B. Vargas’ role during the occupation is presented in Armando J. Malay’s Occupied Philippines (Manila, Filipiniana Book Guild, 1967). CHAPTER XXII There are several good accounts of the guerrilla warfare in the Philippines, each recording the events in a particular place or area. The story of the guerrillas of northern Luzon is told in Guerrilla Days in North Luzon (Manila, 1946) and R. W. Volck- mann’s We Remained (New York, 1954). Some guerrilla activities are also recorded in M. Hamlin Cannon’s Leyte: The Return to the SELECTED REFERENCES 607 Philippines (Washington, 1954). Other books, dealing with guerrilla activities “are Yay Marking’s The Crucible (New York, 1950); Ira Wolfert’s American Guerrilla in the Philippines (New York, 1945); Edward Haggerty’s Guerrilla Padre in Mindanao (New York and Toronto, 1946); Forbes J. Monaghan’s Under the Red Sun (New York, 1946); Joseph F. St. John’s Leyte Calling (New York, 1945); and Jose D. Doromal’s The War in Panay (Manila, 1952). The odyssey of the govemment-in-exile is found in Quezon’s The Good Flight. The accounts of the naval battles leading to the liberation of the Philippines are found in several good of ficial and eyewitness reports: Admiral Frederick C. Sherman’s “The Battles of the Phil¬ ippine Sea/1 The Manila Times, July 14 to August 5, 1947; Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King’s Second Official Report Covering Combat Operations March 1, 1945, a separate pamphlet issued by the United States News; and Lt. Oliver Jensen’s Carrier War (New York, 1945). A rather highly technical account of the naval and land battles is found in H. Hamlin Cannon’s Leyte: The Return to the Philippines. Better and certainly more readable works on the subject are Samuel Eliot Morison’s Leyte: June 1944 — January 1945 (Boston, 1958) and The Liberation of the Philippines, 1944- 1945 (Boston, 1959), and Mac Arthur’s Reminiscences. For some documents on Japan’s blueprint for the conquest of Southeast Asia, see Harry J. Benda, et. al., Japanese Military Administration in Indonesia (Yale University, 1965). The Japanese version of the battle for Leyte Gulf is found in James A. Field, Jr.’s The Japan¬ ese At Leyte Gulf: The Sho Operation (New Haven, 1947). The American Army’s Free Philippines, both the Leyte-Samar and the Manila editions, published daily from October 29,1944 to September 3, 1945, is an important source of in for mation on the events in the Philippines and the world at large during the period. CHAPTER XXIII The data for this chapter have been taken for the most part from«the files of The Manila Chronicle, The Manila Times, and The Manila Post, 1945-1948. The in side stories of the important events of 1945-1946 have been based on the senior author’s diaries and on Hernando Abaya’s Betrayal in the Philippines. Agreements entered into by the Philippines with for eign countries are found in the Department of Foreign Affairs’ Treaty Series, 1947 on Roxas’ speeches and important pronouncements have been collected into 608 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE Important Speeches, Messages, and Other Pronouncements of President Manuel Roxas (Manila, 1947). CHAPTER XXIV The literature on the Hukbalahap Movement is vast and for¬ midable. Being contemporary history, most of the data have been taken from the files of The Manila Chronicle, The Manila Times, and the Daily Mirror, 1945-1954, in clusive. An authoritative ac¬ count of the Huk movement is found in Luis M. Taruc’s Born of the People (New York, 1953). The files of Camp Crame are rich in Huk lore. The senior author used them in writing this chapter. A brief account of the communist movement in the Philippines is found in Jose M. Crisol’s The Red Lie (Manila, 1954), Appendix A. Less biased and more in for med accounts than Crisol’s are Alfredo B. Saulo’s Communism in the Philippines: An Introduc¬ tion (Quezon City, Ateneo de Manila University, 1969) and Ildefcnso T.

A brief survey of the agrarian unrest in the Philippines is found in J. Ralston Hayden’s The Philippines: A Study in National Dev¬ elopment. The history of the socialist movement is traced in Quirino Abad Santos’ “The Historical Background of the Huk Movement,” Philippine Journal of Education, Volume 32, No. 9 March 1954. A sociological view of the agrarian problem is found in Alvin H. Scaff’s The Philippine Answer to Communism (Stan ford, 1955). Hernando Abaya’s Betrayal in the Philippines con¬ tains in side stories about Taruc and Roxas. CHAPTER XXV Most of the data for this chapter have been taken from the files of the dailies, particularly The Manila Times, The Manila Chronicle, and the Daily Mirror, 1952-1959. Official documents in clude the State of-the-Nation Addresses of Magsaysay and Garcia, 1954-1958. The role of the American Central Intelligence SELECTED REFERENCES 609 Agency in the election of Magsaysay is found in David Wise and Thomas B. Ross’s The Invisible Government (Bantam Book, 1964). CHAPTER XXVI The sources for this chapter are mainly the dailies and week¬ lies, particularly The Manila. Times, The Manila Chronicle, The Philippines Free Press, and Graphic. The of ficially published State-of-the-Nation Addresses of Macapagal and Marcos have also been consulted and used. CHAPTER XXVII The data for this chapter have been drawn largely from the dailies and the publications of the Central Bank, the Department of Commerce and Industry, and the National Economic Council. More particularly, the Central Bank’s Economic Indicators and the Department of Commerce and Industry’s annual publication, Philippine Industry and Trade, are a great help in reviewing the country’s economy. The policies of the Presidents of the Philip¬ pines are found in Manuel Roxas’ The Problems of Philippine Rehabilitation and Trade Relations (Manila, 1947), Elpidio Quirino’s The New Philippine Ideology (Manila, 1949), Ramon Magsaysay’s State-of-ther Nation Address for 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957, and Carlos P. Garcia’s State-of-the-Nation Address for 1958 and 1959. Laws dealing with nationalization are found in Handbook of Philippine Nationalization Laws (Revised ed., Manila, 1956). The section on labor is taken partly from The Philippines: A Hand¬ book of Information (Manila, 1955), which the senior author prepared late in 1954 and in early 1955. Labor laws are found in the Department of Labor’s Compilation of Effective Labor Legis¬ lation in the Philippines (Mimeographed, Manila, 1957). The history of the early labor movement is found in the issues of Muling Pagsilang, 1902. to 1908. A brief history of the labor movement is found m Emiliano Morabe’s “History of the Phil¬ ippine Labor Movement,” Department of Labor Yearbook, Volume I, No. 1 (Manila, 1949), and Bias F. Ople’s “The His¬ tory and Direction of Philippine Labor,” The Saturday Mirror Magazine, February 1, 1958. Economic nationalism is well expressed in a speech of Senator Claro M. Recto before the Manila Rotary Club on March 28, 610 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE 1957, in Horacio Lava’s ‘‘Pattern for Progress,” The Manila Times Progress 1958, in the same author’s “The Colonial Structure of the Philippine Economy,” Comment, Second Quarter, 1958, and in the speeches of Dr. Jose Locsin, Chairman of the National Economic Council and of Marcelo S. Balatbat, President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Manager of the NAMAR- CO, and later Secretary of Commerce, delivered at the Lyceum of the Philippines, October 2, 1959, in a forum on “Economic Nationalism.” The Bell Mission Report was published in book form by the Philippine Book Co., Manila, n. d. CHAPTER XXVIII Materials for contemporary history are numerous and need to be sifted. One of the most important sources of in for mation is periodical literature, in the present in stance, The Manila Chronicle, The Manila Times, The Daily Mirror, and other papers and maga¬ zines. The treaties and agreements concluded by the Philippines with for eign countries are found in the Department of Foreign Af¬ fairs’ Treaty Series, 4 volumes, the latest, as of May 1967, being Volume IV, No. 1, 1962-1964. An exposition of Philippine for eign policy is found in then Secretary of Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Romulo’s speech delivered at the Far Eastern University on May 25, 1951, and subsequently published in pamphlet form. Fundamentals of Our Foreign Policy (Manila, 1951). Excellent counterpoints to this policy are found in many speeches of Senator Claro M. Recto, particularly his “Our Asian Foreign Policy,” an address delivered at the Arellano University on April 9, 1949, and “Our Mendicant Foreign Policy,” an address deliver¬ ed before the graduating class of the University of the Philippines on April 17, 1951. For a factual account of Philippine for eign relations, see Milton Walter Meyer’s A Diplomatic History of the Philippine Republic (Hawaii, 1965).

There are many good recent books on Southeast Asia, but those dealing with communist expansion in Korea, SELECTED REFERENCES 611 China, and Indo-China are, respectively, Rutherford M. Poats’ Decision in Korea (New York, 1954), F. F. Liu’s A Military History of Modern China, 1924-1949 (Princeton, 1956), and Ellen J. Hammer’s The Struggle for Indo-China Stanford, 1954). A perceptive analysis of the present struggle in Viet-Nam is found in Jean Locouture’s Vietnam: Between Two Truces (Vintage Book, New York, 1966). CHAPTER XXIX Contemporary accounts of the educational system of the Philippines and the criticisms leveled against it have been pub¬ lished in many magazines. Perceptive studies of that system are found in Alfredo T. Morales’ “Philippine Education, An Appraisal” and “The Crisis in Our Educational System,” published, respect¬ ively, in Progress 1957 and Progress 1959, and in Encamacion Alzona’s “Origins of Our Educational System,” Progress 1959. On community schools, the best sources so far are Juan C. Laya’s Little Democracies (Manila, 1951) and New Schools (Manila, 1952); Six Community Schools of the Philippines (Manila, 1954): It can Be Done: Community Schools of the Philippines (Manila, 1954); Florencio Fresnoza’s The Community School Training Center of Bayambang (Manila, 1954); The Community School of the Philippines (Manila, 1954); and Report of the United Nations Regional Community Development Conference for South East Asia (April, 1955). On language problem the best and most comprehensive writ¬ ing is that of Clifford H. Prator, Jr.’s Language Teaching in the Philippines (n. p., 1950). The contemporary literary situation is discussed in Leopoldo Y. Yabes’ “The State of Philippine Letters,” Progress 1959; Francisco Arcellana’s “The Literary Situation,” 1958,” Progress 1958; and Valdemar Olaguer’s “The Literary Situ¬ at ion,” Progress 1957.

Ocampo’s “Evolution of Philip¬ pine Art, Part II,” This Week, September 13, 1959. Contem¬ porary art and music are written about in the page of The Times Journal and Archipelago, particularly the articles of Emmanuel Torres, Leonidas V. Benesa, and Alfredo R. Roces (for art), and Vilma Santiago-Felipe and Rosalinda Orosa (for music). 612 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE CHAPTER XXX The sources for this chapter are mostly primary and may be found not only in contemporary newspapers and magazines, but in the of ficial publications of the Government, among them the following: Vital Documents (National Media Production Center, n. d.), Vols.

The rilipino parent exercises almost absolute powers over the children. It is unthinkable for a Filipino to do an important thing with out consulting his parents. The latter do not condone children talking back not only to them, but to those older than they are. The Filipino is naturally fatalistic. No amount of expostulation on the virtues of science or logic can dislodge him from his idea of fatalism. He believes that whatever happens to him is the work of Fate. This fatalism is best symbolized in the phrase \"Baha/a na,\" a phrase that defies translation but which may be rendered loosely as \"come what may.\" Loyalty to a friend or to a benefactor is one trait that is very strong in the Filipino. Do him a little favor and he remembers you to the end of his days. For to the Filipino, friendship is sacred and implies mutual help under any circumstances. A friend is expected to come to the aid not only of a personal friend, but also of the latter's family. A man's friend is considered a member of the family and is expected to share its tribulations as well as its prosperity and happiness. It is almost unthinkable for the Filipino to betray his friend, and if there be such one, he becomes a marked man: ostracism is the lightest punishment that can be meted out to him.

He is re¬ freshingly opinionated in a profession that is of ten namby-pamby for fear of arousing controversy, anger, or or ganized crusades which, if he depended for his living on an in stitution less liberal than the state university, could mean his expulsion from the classroom. \"Shortly after The Revolt of the Masses came out an effort was made in certain quarters to link it with what has since been called 'legal and parliamentary Communism.' The academic witch- hunters failed, but they will doubtless try again after they have read Malolos which, more effectively than The Revolt, projects Agoncillo's overall view of the Philippine Revolution as a struggle between the 'Haves' and the 'Have nots.'\" — EMILIO AGUILAR CRUZ, art critic, essayist, and editor. The Daily Mirror. \"One great advantage of Agoncillo is that he writes with ease and distinction, being an accepted writer of note in English and in the national dialect_ He can the refore be extremely persuasive in his arguments because cf this literary quality of his writing. He in terprets his characters wit!, feeling and the events of history in his hands take on the in vitability, in some in stances, of a classical tragedy.\" -DR.

Total Questions Evaluated: 2037

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCURACY METRICS (Semantic Answer Quality)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Average F1 Score:          0.2247 (22.5%)
  → Mean semantic similarity (token overlap) across all answers

Answer Quality Distribution:
  Excellent (F1 > 0.75):   1.57% (32/2037)
    → Very high semantic similarity to ground truth
  Good (F1 > 0.50):        8.10% (165/2037)
    → Substantial semantic overlap
  Acceptable (F1 > 0.30):  19.83% (404/2037)
    → Moderate semantic overlap
  Poor (F1 ≤ 0.30):        70.50% (1436/2037)
    → Low semantic overlap

Overall Quality Rate (F1 > 0.30): 29.50%
  → Answers with at least acceptable semantic similarity

Note: For sentence-level Q&A, F1 score measures semantic similarity
      via token overlap. Exact Match is not applicable for full sentences.

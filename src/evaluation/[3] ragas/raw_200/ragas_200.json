This document is issued in case there is someone, whosoever, some time in the future who will state that the debt is not yet acquitted of His Honor …” —The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, translated by Antoon Postma, quoted in E. P. Patanñe, The Philippines in the Sixth to the Sixteenth Centuries T HE FULL STORY BEHIND THE L AGUNA C OPPERPLATE I NSCRIPTION (LCI) may never be known. Discovered in 1989 buried in a riverbank in Laguna Province, south of Manila, the LCI was drawn up in 900 C. E., the equivalent of the Sanskrit calendar date in scribed on it—more than five hundred years before the barangay (village or settlement) of Maynila turned into a Muslim community, and more than six centuries before the Europeans first learned of the archipelago’s existence. The in scription—the oldest known document of pre-Hispanic times in the Philippine archipelago—is vital to understanding how people in the islands, at least in certain parts, lived and what kind of society or societies they might have constructed. The LCI writing bears remarkable similarities to the ancient Kawi script of Indonesia. Analyses by experts in both ancient Philippine and Indonesian scripts reveal a language that contained not only Sanskrit but also old Javanese, old Malay, and old Tagalog words. It antedates baybayin, the native script in use when the Spanish came calling in the sixteenth century, one that, with variations in alphabet according to the region, essentially consisted of twenty letters. The LCI script, no longer extant, lingered on in the baybayin’s for mative in fluences such as Sanskrit and Arabic. With the advent of the Spanish, and the in tervention primarily of the friars, the Castilian alphabet replaced the native scripts, but those communities in the in terior that managed to steer clear of Spanish rule and the new faith kept their old systems of writing. A form of baybayin can still be seen, for in stance, in the script of the Hanunoo Mangyan of Mindoro Island, off the southwestern coast of Luzon, a tribe that continues to in scribe on bamboo a form of its poetry known as the ambahan, with seven-syllable lines meant primarily to be chanted. The copperplate ment ions place names that still exist in latter-day Bulacan, a province abutting the northern edge of Tondo, another ancient settlement that faced Maynila across the Pasig River delta. More significantly, it persuasively at tests to the Hindu in fluence of the Sumatra-based Srivijaya empire, which had spread beyond the central part of the Philippine archipelago—and to which the colonists had affixed the name “Visayas”—to the strategically located barangays of Tondo and Maynila, where the river empties out onto a magnificent bay and the South China Sea. Through the two barangays, which would have controlled river traffic, some form of Hindu in fluence would have spread to other areas in Luzon where the Tagalogs (the principal tribe of Tondo and Maynila) were also dominant. Indeed, modern-day Tagalog possesses words that are Sanskrit in or igin: budhi (conscience), mukha (face), guro (teacher), tala (star), dukha (needy), diwata (muse, goddess), among them. Perhaps most tellingly, the LCI in dicates the crucial role that slavery played in barangay pre-colonial life. Lady Angkatan, Bukah, son of Namwran, and members of their immediate family were almost certainly debt slaves, and this document would have given them a tremendous sense of relief. We will never know whether Lady Angkatan was Namwran’s widow, aunt, mother, or sister; nor what the Honorable Namwran did to acquit the family of this debt. Had he distinguished himself in battle, giving up his life for the sake of his chief? Or was it Bukah who bore arms bravely? It seems clear that this was a seemingly well-born family that through misfortune or Namwran’s misguided business dealings found itself unable to pay back a substantial loan. Now, they could hold their heads high once more. In a sense, they were for tunate to have been in debted to the paramount chief of their clan. It would have been worse had they been abducted by their clan enemies or by tattooed raiders from the Visayas, the cluster of islands in the archipelago’s center, whom the Spanish called pintados, or painted ones. The number and in tricacy of a Visayan warrior’s tattoos signaled to friend and foe alike his strength and abilities as a warrior. More than land or goods, slaves were a sure sign of one’s wealth and status, especially slaves captured in raiding parties on other barangays. As war booty, not only were they tangible proof of a datu’s leadership and martial prowess (more so than homegrown, as it were, slaves), they were more likely to be treated as disposable property, sometimes put to death when the master moved on to the next world. Another basis of slavery was as punishment for crimes. These in cluded bearing false witness against someone; the transgression of taboo customs, such as, according to the sixteenth-century account of the Jesuit Pedro Chirino, “failure to preserve silence for the dead” or “happening to pass in front of a chief who was bathing”; murder; adultery; or failing to do one’s duty (during war, for in stance) when the chief, or datu, asked for it. Such crimes could be for given if the transgressor could pay the proper fee of goods or gold to the aggrieved party. Colonial rule under the Spanish, which lasted for 333 years, from 1565 to 1898, eliminated certain aspects of barangay life, such as slavery, though modern-day critics might assert that slavery persists in disguised forms in to day’s highly in equitable society; in troduced Christianity and Western concepts such as bureaucratic state rule and private property; and modified, if not strengthened, some features of pre-colonial ways of living, e. g., the melding of the private and public spheres of life"

In the archipelago, the Iberians had come upon different societies, at once static and dynamic, with well-defined frameworks within which the world made sense. To the Spanish, of course, in fected with an overbearing sense of racial superiority and entitlement, the native way of life was savage and the refore had to be supplanted with the European notion of civilization. The conquistador Miguel de Legazpi, who led the 1565 expedition that successfully brought most of the islands under the dominion of the Spanish Crown, after grudgingly noting that the island men treated and loved their wives well, summed up rather succinctly what he and most of his compatriots really thought: “They are all barbarians and have no manners or politeness.” What kind of archipelagic societies did the Spanish first encounter? What were the various island communities like before the advent of the West? How did the pre-Hispanic Filipinos relate to the rest of Southeast Asia? To draw a portrait, which must of necessity be for ever in complete since history is a never- ending process of revisions and counter-revisions, one needs to begin with geography, for geography helps shape destiny. It is a major element in determining how history and hierarchy in the islands evolved. The archipelago known to day as the Republic of the Philippines lies on the northeastern rim of Southeast Asia, a necklace of 7,107 isles strung from north to south over 1,152 miles, situated between the vast and mighty Pacific Ocean to the east and the gentler, lesser South China Sea to the west. The islands cover a to tal area of 115,831 square miles, roughly the same size as Italy. Only 2,773 of the islands bear names, with elongated Luzon in the north the largest, and Mindanao to the south the next in size. These two islands constitute two-thirds of the country’s land mass. Between them are the Visayan Islands, consisting mainly of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Negros, Bohol, and Panay. The western edge of the country is taken up by the mini-archipelago of Palawan Province, made up of the island of Palawan and 1,700 satellite isles. This semi-tropical island chain has only two—but very distinct—seasons: dry and wet. The northern and eastern regions lie within the typhoon belt: areas directly affected by storms that come raging out of the Pacific during the latter half of the year. On the average, typhoons maul the eastern Visayas and Luzon twenty times annually, at one time prompting a frustrated lawmaker to propose a bill outlawing them. In the Cordilleras of Northern Luzon the weather can be downright chilly, when winds from as far north as Siberia, along with migratory birds, travel south. With the typhoons breaking against the eastern flanks of mountain ranges, there is less of a pronounced dry season on the Pacific side. Hence, more people and businesses reside in the western part of the country, rendering the west more in dustrialized and economically developed. Island geography owes much of its ruggedness to being part of the Pacific Rim of Fire, a line of volcanic for mations that extend, in the northern hemisphere, from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The Philippines contains thirty-seven volcanoes, the majority thankfully dormant, though one volcano blowing its top is always a reminder that others could follow suit. Such was the case with Mt. Pinatubo which, six hundred years after its last awakening, erupted in 1991 with such ferocity over five days that gaseous plumes ascended to as high up as twenty-four miles and spewed out seven cubic kilometers of ash and rock—the worst such eruption in the country’s history and possibly of the twentieth century. On the other hand, volcanic deposits are one reason the land is fertile, generating life where once it buried it. East of the archipelago, off the coast of northeastern Luzon south to Halmahera Island in Indonesia, the Philippine Deep, also known as the Mindanao Trench, stretches for close to a thousand miles, measuring roughly nineteen miles across. At its deepest it extends 34,850 feet below sea level— deeper than Mt. Everest is tall. The Philippine Deep rests on the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, which constantly shift and grind against each other. As an entity that gained political in dependence only in 1946, the nation is quite young, a little more than six decades old. Geologically, however, it is a different story. Large swaths of Luzon and Mindanao are more than 25 million years old, while the age of the rest of the country varies, from 100,000 to 10 million years old. During the late Pleistocene era, some islands were linked to the Asian mainland; among these were Palawan, Mindoro, and Panay. Palawan, having once been part of Borneo, has flora and fauna not found in the rest of the country. Evolution and the for mation of a rather isolated archipelago has resulted in an astonishing biodiversity over a landmass of 30 million hectares, or 66 million acres, with a number of endemic species, e. g., 70 percent of its reptiles and 44 percent of its avian creatures are not to be found anywhere else. However, the rate of population growth is quite high. In 2008, with a population of 90 million, it was 2 percent a year, in large part due to an exceedingly in fluential and conservative Catholic hierarchy that rails against government-sponsored family planning. (In contrast, the 2008 rate for the United States was less than 1 percent.) This, along with a depressed economy, has resulted, perhaps most critically, in an environment continually under siege"

Many species have a tenuous hold on life, as they require primary-for est habitats. Such is the case with the Philippine Eagle, more popularly known as the monkey-eating eagle—a large and magnificent avian predator with a wingspan of nearly seven feet. A pair needs approximately twenty-five to fifty square miles of for est to sustain the mselves and to propagate. A S W E W ERE: P RE -C OLONIAL B ARANGAY S OCIETY It was long held as common wisdom that populations in the archipelago were the result of migrations that took place in neat, successive waves, between 30,000 B. C. E. and 200 B. C. E.—the last wave composed of Malays from the south who had more advanced forms of metallurgy and crafts, such as the weaving of cloth and the manufacture of glass or naments. This the ory’s biggest proponent was the late American anthropologist H. Otley Beyer, at one time head of the anthropology department at the University of the Philippines, who based his conclusions on pioneering fieldwork done from the 1920 s to the early 1940 s. While the artifacts recovered from the field were in deed valuable, his the ory has since fallen out of favor. According to linguists, various languages were already being spoken throughout the archipelago thousands of years ago. Too, archaeological evidence reveals that trade was flourishing in the region in the first millennium B. C. E., probably even earlier—both pointing to the fact that groups of people of different or igins came and stayed or went, sometimes in larger numbers, sometimes in smaller, but never so methodically as envisioned in Beyer’s grand the ory. There seem to have been at least two discrete movements of people that, over time, dispersed through in sular Southeast Asia: the Australoids, characterized by dark pigmentation, and the Austronesians, or brown-skinned peoples, who started to arrive about six millennia ago, from the south via Borneo and Indonesia, and the north from southern China and Taiwan. Later migrations in cluded people from Champa, a Hinduized kingdom of seafarers and traders in southern and central Vietnam that flourished from the seventh century to the fifteenth century C. E. It wasn’t just one way, apparently. The eminent archaeologist Wilhelm G. Solheim II adds another layer to this diffusion when he suggests that the cultures of the natives of Southeast Asia, whom he calls Nusantao, and their descendants, had their beginnings in, or at the very least were in fluenced by, maritime- or iented tribes of in sular Southeast Asia, dating to 5000 B. C. E. or even earlier. Islanders came and went, as did the coastal dwellers of mainland eastern Asia, the twain meeting—and mating—repeatedly over the course of millennia. According to Solheim, long-distance seafaring vessels known as balangay and outfitted with in novative bamboo outriggers may have been devised about 4000 B. C. E., in itiating major outmigrations by water. The buoyant outriggers helped balance the shallow-draft vessel while at the same time enabling it to navigate smoothly and speedily over the water—a feature remarked upon in later accounts of European navigators used to bulkier and slower ships. The larger ones, equipped with sails, could be used in war as well, with rowers on each side. These war vessels, known variously as karakoas and prahus, had platforms above the outriggers upon which as many as a hundred warriors could stand. By the third millennium B. C. E., these migrations had resulted in settlements in both the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. By the second millennium B. C. E., they had gone as far west as Madagascar, off the eastern coast of Africa. Human settlements known as barangays, after the outriggered boats, were thus firmly in place in the Philippines well before the Spanish arrived, with a number of larger barangays trading with for eign ships that plied Southeast Asian waters. While archaeological evidence at tests to human presence in the archipelago as far back as 250,000 years ago, the earliest known human settlements were in caves on the southern reaches of long, dagger-shaped Palawan Island. Evidence suggests that the caves were continuously in habited from 50,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene Age, until 9,000 B. C. E.—one vanguard of the seafaring peoples who for med the main matrix of contemporary populations. Known as the Tabon Caves and set into ocean-facing cliffs, they would have afforded a clear view of waterborne visitors and provided easy access to the waters the mselves. Possibly the oldest Homo sapiens fossil in Southeast Asia, nicknamed the Tabon Man, was unearthed here, carbon-dated to 47,000 years ago. But the Tabon Man was more than one in dividual, the finds in cluding a skullcap, jawbones, teeth, and bone fragments, with one tibia being the oldest fossil. The Tabon Man appears to have had Negritoid characteristics— strengthening the argument that the islands were or iginally in habited by the Australoids, ancestors of the modern-day Negritos, otherwise known as the Agta, Aeta, or Ati. Food gatherers and hunters, the Tabon men and women, devising necessary strategies of survival, progressed from basic flake to ols to in struments such as adzes and axes. Like the Tabon Cave dwellers, most of the islanders lived by or close to water, whether ocean, river, or lake—sources of abundant food. Water was obviously the only transportation route to other islands, and these dwellers by the water engaged in brisk trade not just with nearby isles, but with ports as disparate as those on the southern coast of China and the Straits of Malacca"

Water was obviously the only transportation route to other islands, and these dwellers by the water engaged in brisk trade not just with nearby isles, but with ports as disparate as those on the southern coast of China and the Straits of Malacca. Larger population centers sprung up due to trade and, in some areas, most notably in Mindanao, the in sistent call of Islam. But there were no fiercely ambitious warlords, no Tokugawa or Genghis Khan, who set out to unify many fiefdoms. Until the Spanish appeared on the horizon, no nation-state existed, only a far-flung collection of islands untroubled by the notion of a center. Trade The archipelago for med the outer edges of an established trade circle, one that extended from the Persian Gulf in the Middle East to Southern China, thus encompassing Southeast Asia. It was at its most active from the seventh to the ninth century C. E., and antedated European in vasion in the sixteenth century. Chinese records from 671 contain references to Persian ships. Later accounts, in cluding Japanese ones, ment ion not just the Persians but Indians and Malays as well, all trading at Canton. By 851, this trade route was well-established, with ships making calls at India’s Malabar Coast, the Nicobar Islands, the Malay Peninsula, passing through the Straits of Malacca, with more calls at Cambodia and Vietnam, before heading to Canton. According to historian Janet Abu- Lughod, in her book Before European Hegemony, “The easternmost circuit was Chinese ‘space,’ the sea that joined the east coast of Indochina and the northern shore of Java with the great ports of South China being under the hegemony of the Sung and Yuan navies. This … was the domain par excellence of what scholars have called the tribute trade.” Of the pre-colonial Philippine ports that for med part of this trading world, Butuan was one of the most active, probably the center of trade and commerce in the islands during the eleventh century. Situated on the northwestern coast of Mindanao by the Agusan River, Butuan was a putative city-state by October 1003, the first pre-Hispanic Philippine barangay known to for mally deal with Imperial China when it sent two envoys by the names of Lihiyan and Jiaminan (the names suggest Sinicization) to Beijing, to recognize the Divine Son of Heaven as undisputed sovereign, and, not coincidentally, to petition for the right to trade. The Butuan traders likely would have brought tropical hardwoods, beeswax, cinnamon, civet cats, cowry shells, abaca, and gold. Some of these would have been gifts for the royal court. Butuan also traded with the kingdom of Champa. Between 900 and 1200 C. E., in addition to Butuan, the Champa established trading outposts in Sulu. By the fifteenth century, 400 to 500 junks from Cambodia, Champa, and southern China were visiting the islands annually. Yet, while situated strategically between the Persian Gulf and China, thus ensuing their value as transit points, Southeast Asian pre-colonial entrepots were not the region’s dominant players. They acted mostly as sources for raw materials, or as transshipment centers, of which the most valuable was the port of Malacca. (Malacca was also a major slave market, where slave raiders brought their human cargo, abducted from various coastal to wns in Southeast Asia, to be sold to customers as varied as merchants looking for laborers and ship captains wanting to supplement their crews.) It had four harbormasters for ships or iginating from as near as Sumatra and Java, as far west as Persia, and as far north as the Ryu Kyu Islands and China. Commercial traffic along the Straits of Malacca thus helped shape the burgeoning global trade, especially during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. According to William Henry Scott, in Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society, “It was in Malacca that Europeans”— specifically, the Portuguese—“first met Filipinos,” a decade before the Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan came across the archipelago in 1521. These pre-Hispanic Filipinos were called “Luzones,” from the island whence they had come. The Luzones were known not only as merchants and traders but also as fierce mercenaries active in various military campaigns in the region, employed, for in stance, by the Achenese and the Burmese kings, or crewing on pirate ships. West of Malacca, on the coast, was a community of 500 Tagalogs, while in Malacca itself, according to Scott, “they had their own shops and in cluded a number of prominent businessmen.” The Portuguese took over Malacca in 1511, with Magellan as part of the conquering force. It was in Malacca that he purchased a young Malay slave he had christened Enrique, who would prove to be an in valuable asset when, ten years later, the Spanish exploratory fleet Magellan headed came across the islands later to be called the Philippines. It is the refore not unreasonable to assume that even before 1521, Magellan and the Portuguese knew of the Philippine archipelago, east and northeast of the Malay Peninsula. The region was rich in natural resources, from minerals to spices to for est and maritime products, and this, coupled with rising demand from countries outside the region, ensured an almost perfect fit among supplier, manufacturer, and consumer. In short, as Abu-Lughod points out, Malacca was ideally located as a comprador site, just as Hong Kong and Singapore are now. In this trade world, the Chinese were active, if not dominant, players. At one time the Middle Kingdom commanded an enormous fleet—the so-called Treasure Fleet, under the command of a seven-foot-tall eunuch, Cheng Ho. On its in itial voyage in 1405, the fleet was made up of 27,800 men and 1,500 vessels, dwarfing any of the European fleets then"

The region was rich in natural resources, from minerals to spices to for est and maritime products, and this, coupled with rising demand from countries outside the region, ensured an almost perfect fit among supplier, manufacturer, and consumer. In short, as Abu-Lughod points out, Malacca was ideally located as a comprador site, just as Hong Kong and Singapore are now. In this trade world, the Chinese were active, if not dominant, players. At one time the Middle Kingdom commanded an enormous fleet—the so-called Treasure Fleet, under the command of a seven-foot-tall eunuch, Cheng Ho. On its in itial voyage in 1405, the fleet was made up of 27,800 men and 1,500 vessels, dwarfing any of the European fleets then. The Chinese had as their sole aim for ging trade relations with their Asian neighbors. On several voyages, the Chinese fleet sailed to Africa and the Persian Gulf, and points between, setting up a trading network that built on previous outposts. Unlike the European expansionists later on, the Middle Kingdom had no imperialist ambitions, disdaining to rule over the non- Chinese, whom they dismissed as barbarians—except for the Koreans, the Japanese, and the Annamese. The dynamics of this trade system underwent a drastic change, however, when the Chinese shut down their ports to for eign ships, essentially abandoning their trading network and mothballing the kingdom’s powerful navy in the fifteenth century, during the Ming Dynasty. Until then, no one nation had at tempted to dominate the Asian trade. The sealanes were remarkably free, for the most part, from armed conflict and thus relatively peaceful. The with drawal of China’s powerful fleets resulted in a vacuum the Portuguese gladly filled in the early sixteenth century. The Portuguese and, later, other European powers, were thus accidental beneficiaries of the Middle Kingdom’s hermetic move. By the mid sixteenth century Spanish and Portuguese galleons and warships, along with pirates (who still plague the Straits to day), prowled the shipping lanes with out any challenge from the Chinese navy. Transactions with the Philippine archipelago, while profitable, did not constitute major business for for eign traders, as the islands were on the eastern edge of the trade routes. But in ternational commerce was extensive enough to generate a vital in ter-island trade that relied as much on for eign goods coming in —from, for in stance, China, Borneo, and Champa—as on local products. From China came porcelain, finished silk, musk, stoneware, in cense, artillery, and tin. Brass, steel blades, and woven mats were brought from Borneo, batik from Java, and precious stones from countries such as Burma. In exchange, for eign traders could purchase in a transshipping port like Cebu—smack in the middle of the archipelago—such items as pearls, beeswax, to rtoise shell, animal skins, cotton, and civet cats. The coastal dwellers traded as well with the hunter/gatherers who lived in the in terior and in the highlands, bartering, for in stance, salt for honey, and cloth for beeswax—for est products that could be retailed to for eign traders. (At times, lowlander and highlander were at each other’s throats, but never so habitually or bitterly as to prevent trading.) That water played a central role in the lives of the islanders can be further gleaned from the names of both places and tribes. For in stance, Mindanao has its etymological roots in danao, referring to a body of water. The same is true of Lanao, Maranao, and Maguindanao. Tausug, the name of the major ethnic tribe in the Sulu archipelago, means “people of the current,” with “Tau” a variant of “tao” or person. Tagalog, the name of the ethnic group predominant in Central Luzon and parts of Southern Luzon, means literally “from the river,” or Taga-ilog. And the city of Manila, located in the Tagalog region, is a shortened form of the or iginal Maynila, “place of water lilies.” Similar aquatic correlations at tend other place names, such as the province of Pampanga (“site of river banks”) in Luzon and, in Mindanao, the Agusan River, with “agusan” meaning “where the water flows,” rendering the English name linguistically redundant. Whether coastal, riverine, or hinterland, the different communities developed ways of living that—in fluenced by fertile soil, in frequent harsh weather, and a uniform ecology—were quite similar. As the Philippine historian Onofre D. Corpuz observed, “The generally benign tropical climate and the largely uniform flora and fauna favored similarities, not differences.” However, reflecting island geography, pre-colonial Philippine society was not an unbroken, homogenous entity. It is the refore more accurate to speak of “societies,” though there were enough similarities among these to in dicate common or igins and an archipelago- wide in teraction, from north to south, from west to east. Interestingly, according to William Henry Scott in Barangay, the similarities “also suggest that lowland Filipinos in the sixteenth century had more in common with highland minorities in the twentieth than with their own Christian descendants”—an in dication of how the in tervening centuries of Christian colonization of the lowlanders widened the heretofore in consequential gap between them and the highlanders. Hierarchy Native societies, as the Spanish found them, were, like Caesar’s Gaul, divided into three parts: the ruling elite, their peers and followers, and slaves. (It must be kept in mind that most descriptions and judgments of a pre-colonial Philippines are mainly derived from Spanish accounts, with all that that implies in terms of a priori notions stemming from the observers’ own Christian and European backgrounds.) The social structures that existed in both the Visayas and Luzon were remarkably similar, consisting of the datus and the maginoo at the top, the timawa and maharlika in the middle, and, occupying the bottom rungs, the alipin. The smallest politico-social unit was the barangay, which, as has been noted, or iginally referred to the seagoing vessel on which a family or clan traveled. Usage of the term for land-based settlements in dicated that the settlers favored a location by a body of water, be it river, lake, or ocean. Most barangays were small, consisting of only thirty to one hundred houses, with from one hundred to five hundred persons. Off the trade routes but still on the coast were even smaller settlements, probably no more than eight to ten houses. Still, there were some giant barangays"

Most barangays were small, consisting of only thirty to one hundred houses, with from one hundred to five hundred persons. Off the trade routes but still on the coast were even smaller settlements, probably no more than eight to ten houses. Still, there were some giant barangays. Maynila, for in stance, had two thousand in habitants at the time of Spanish conquest, while Cebu and the sultanates in Sulu and Mindanao were comparable in size, if not larger. But these bigger barangays were the exceptions rather than the rule. A datu headed the barangay, with each barangay more or less self-contained, though there were occasionally alliances among various barangays. There were no for mal allegiances beyond the barangay, except in the Muslim settlements to the south. Relations within the barangay were largely in fluenced by kinship ties on both parents’ sides and by economic status. Members of the or iginal barangay, having traveled on the same boat, would have been part of the same clan. Blood ties were thus of the utmost importance, for they guaranteed fealty to the barangay. Alliances between two chiefs of different barangays would of ten be sealed through a blood compact, where each would drink wine mingled with the other’s blood—or suck the blood directly from a cut made on the arm of the other. Simulating blood ties, the rite was called sandugo (or “one blood”). To the Spanish, this barangay ritual must have been an eerie reminder of the Eucharist, the Christian sacrament based on a belief in transubstantion, the conversion of bread and wine into Christ’s body and blood, communicants becoming one with the Divine, one reason that the Spanish may have taken readily to this ritual. Hence, the barangay was essentially an extended family, a gathering of a particular clan. Well into the mid-eighteenth century, with the Spanish long entrenched, people for ced to resettle into new to wns (due to the colonial policy known as reducción ) still referred to the mselves as kabangka —from the “same boat,” bangka being another word for boat. One’s position within the barangay was affected less by birthright (though the position of datu could be in herited) than by acknowledged prowess both in leadership and in providing for the survival of the barangay—roughly identical to one’s worth in keeping the boat shipshape. There were then no claims to a divine imprimatur or special access to the heavens, no boasts about having a hotline to God. In any case, such claims to otherworldly connections would have been the province of the local shaman and seer, the katolonan in the Tagalog regions, and babaylan in the Visayas, who could be male (even a cross-dressing one) or female but was more of ten than not the latter. Since the barangay was not a political state as we know it, the datu could be more properly thought of as the head of a social unit, the paterfamilias, if you will. Consequently, a datu’s authority rested as much on his abilities in combat, especially raids that resulted in the capture of slaves, as on his wealth, the strength and depth of his followers, and his lineage. Thus, a datu could be oppressive or generous, broad-minded or narrow in outlook in the way he governed and adjudicated disputes within the barangay. He was expected to be his followers’ champion in battle. (With the Tagalogs, the class to which the datu belonged was that of the maginoo, or his peers, a term that could refer to either sex.) Members of a barangay reciprocated by contributing labor, such as helping to harvest his crops, and paying tribute for his household’s maintenance. The datu’s followers were the freemen, either the timawa or the maharlika — the distinction being made on the basis of service rendered to the datu. The timawa rendered the irs primarily in non-military ways, though they could bear arms if they so desired. The maharlika, on the other hand, functioned roughly as knights did for a king. To think of these freemen as commoners would be misleading, however. In a self-contained society that was the barangay, the timawa and the maharlika had a close relationship with the datu, albeit in varying degrees. In essence, they made up his court: close by at his feasts, alongside him in battle, whether on the field or in a ship, acting as his emissaries, etc. Since a settlement and its social structure arose out of barangay conditions, relations among the three groups were more fluid than can be accommodated by the idea of “class,” though there were societal divisions of labor, to be sure. But even such hierarchical relations could be and were of ten radically altered. A datu could be deposed, a maharlika reduced to dependence, and a debt-slave become free if he or she paid off his/her debts—or if, as in the case of the for tunate Namwran, those debts were for given. The barangay social or der being an extension of the family, the notion of private ownership of land was irrelevant. It made no sense to claim particular tracts permanently, given there was so much land available. Hence, in dividuals would not have thought of acquiring land, though they had the right of usufruct if they had cultivated a particular parcel. Every member of the barangay was a shareholder the or etically and could derive profit from land use. The datu, however, representing the apex of communal society, was in strumental in determining how such lands would be used. One could thus utilize the land but not hold title to it—the idea of “title,” of course, not coming into play. With fixed-site agriculture and fishing primarily for livelihood, barangay economies were tailored mostly to meet the barangay’s needs, and for possible barter with other barangays. As in any family or clan, the stress was on shared labor, whether this was in farming, say, or house building.

As in any family or clan, the stress was on shared labor, whether this was in farming, say, or house building. The practice of bayanihan (literally, communal solidarity) in to day’s evolving, not to ment ion disappearing, rural society can be traced to this tradition of shared labor. Producers owned their means of production, and any surplus from a bountiful harvest was stored against a rainy day or for barter, rather than for purely speculative purposes. In a word, the archipelagic barangay was not only pre-colonial but also pre-capitalist. Probably the most spectacular and awe-in spiring in stance of enduring bayanihan are the rice terraces of Northern Luzon, high up in the Cordillera Mountain Range. In continuous use since they were built two millennia ago by the Ifugao (one of several tribes based in the Cordilleras), these magnificent embankments were carved out of stubborn and treacherous mountainsides. Organizing the labor, building up the paddies, and devising the placement of rocks and irrigation canals were daunting challenges that required a tight, cohesive, and efficient social structure. Made up of kinship ties, the barangay did not constitute a system in dependent from its in habitants—it had no existence as a legal fiction, unlike a modern-day to wnship. Thus, a barangay had no public buildings for government or community affairs, no castles or town halls. The datu’s residence would have been the largest building and the center of the barangay. The idea of what passed for “public” was really the private world writ larger. (However, the highlander tribes in Northern Luzon, or Igorot, as they are collectively known, had and still have what is known as the dap-ay, an open-air community space, like a table in the round, where the elders gather to discuss pressing issues.) Nonetheless, some barangays developed supra-barangay affinities, such as the Muslim sultanates. The earliest one, the Sultanate of Sulu, established in the fifteenth century, a century before the advent of the Spanish, arose in Jolo in the Sulu archipelago, southwest of Mindanao and in close proximity to Borneo and the Indonesian archipelago. The second, later sultanate emerged in Maguindanao, with tradition holding that a certain Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuwan moved north to Mindanao from Malacca, after the Portuguese took over that port city in 1511. Three other large barangays were the aforementioned Butuan in northwestern Mindanao; the principal Visayan trading port of Cebu, in the center of the islands; and Maynila in Luzon. By the sixteenth century, however, Butuan had declined as a trading center. Maynila, which the Spanish would make the seat of power in the islands in the late sixteenth century and shorten its name to “Manila,” constituted the preeminent settlement in Luzon, since it, with links to Muslim communities in Mindanao and Borneo, had a higher stage of political development. Its burgeoning status as a sultanate was however for ever disrupted when the Spanish razed Maynila in 1571, for cing the ruling datu and his people to flee. The year after, the Spanish started to erect the Walled City of Intramuros on the ashes of what could have been the Sultanate of Maynila. As noted, pre-colonial society was also marked by slavery, which, while it had several gradations, fell generally under two types of alipin: those who had their own houses and tended their own fields, and those who dwelt with their master. The for mer were known as namamahay (literally, one who keeps house), while the latter were referred to as sagigilid (literally, on the edge or periphery, i. e., living in the master’s household but of marginal status). The namamahay had more freedom than the sagigilid, and were practically freemen when not called upon to serve the master—which was not too of ten. In contrast, the sagigilid, usually unmarried and being part of their master’s household, were expected to render service on a daily basis. They also faced the possibility of being sold. But even they could eat at the same table as their master and had the prospect of moving up the social rung either through marriage—in cluding marriage into the master’s family—or, if they earned enough, through buying their freedom. The most common cause of slavery was the in ability to pay a debt, and the debtor had to remain in servitude, or his family (remember Namwran?) if the debtor had in the meantime passed away, until the debt was repaid with in terest. Since barangays at heart were kin-based, the hardships and conditions of bondage were relatively benign, compared, say, to the horrific conditions that African slaves endured when trafficked by Europeans to their colonies. Slaves, however, who were captured in battle or in raids on other barangays, being outside the clan, faced other potentially grim fates. They could be candidates for human sacrifice when the occasion demanded it, such as the death of a powerful datu. In his Relacíon de Las Islas Filipinas ( Account of the Philippine Islands ), published in 1604, a detailed and subjective portrait of sixteenth-century mores among the in digenous people, the Spanish Jesuit Pedro Chirino observed “it was easy to in crease the number of slaves. Consequently, they used to have, and still have, a very large number of slaves, which among them is the greatest of riches.” He also wrote, “In for mer times, they would not let them depart to the other world alone, but gave male and female slaves to accompany the dead.

These slaves, having first eaten a hearty meal, were then immediately killed, that they might go with the dead man. It once happened that they buried with a chief a vessel manned by many rowers, who were to serve him in his voyages to the other world.” Nevertheless, social status in native society appeared to be quite fluid, malleable due to the possibilities of upward mobility through reducing one’s in debtedness and correspondingly in creasing one’s social prestige. The idea of an immutable hierarchy, as in the Hindu caste system, was notably absent. According to historian Vicente Rafael, in his Contracting Colonialism, “Village society owed its apparent mobility to the displaceability of obligations. Status reflected in debtedness, not the person…. Indeed, the possibility of shifting from one rank to another—as evidenced by the fine gradations of servitude—bespoke the tendency to dissociate status from person.” P EOPLE T RAVEL AND S O D O I DEAS Ports by nature are in teractive sites, as true millennia ago as it is now. Merchants, seamen, travelers, and emissaries from various culture zones not only traded goods but stories and ideas as well. Along with commerce, ideas made their way between the Mediterranean and the Middle East and the South China Sea, a globalization anticipating that of contemporary times. Traders, in short, brought the mselves and not just their goods. They were in dividuals with specific worldviews and beliefs that of ten were new to a port. Thus, Islam migrated via the Indian Ocean into Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula in just such a manner. However, this mix of religious, social, political, and cultural elements resists facile categorizing that would have the flow of in fluences only one way, from the “greater” to the “lesser,” as Abu-Lughod points out. The long unquestioned assumption has been that China and India were major in fluences on Southeast Asia, whose smaller states or communities were perceived as beneficiaries of supposedly more sophisticated continental cultures. But the reality was, as it is now, more complex than that. Interactions among different cultural agents were more layered and diverse than is conventionally presented. In fact, according to Solheim, archaeological excavations in Thailand in dicate that domestication of plants there began as early as 10,000 B. C. E. The excavations turned up an imprint of a grain of rice carbon dated to about 3,500 B. C. E., a thousand years before its presence was detected in India or China. According to Solheim, Thai metallurgy began in about 4,000 B. C. E., and fine quality bronze was already being produced by the third millennium, some 500 years before it was found in India and 1,000 years before China. Because of the development of the long-distance outrigger boats, trading in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea was underway by the first millennium B. C. E., enabling the two-way flow, as much from the lesser to the greater as vice versa. Nevertheless, while Southeast Asia was a more in teractive player in cultural matters than is usually envisioned, by the first millennium C. E., it was subject to major in fluences such as Buddhism and Hinduism, coming from China and India. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, with new powers in Asia coming to the fore—e. g., the Cholas, the Khmers, and the Burmese—diverse sets of relationships came about among realms that were not yet politically or culturally unified entities. And by the late thirteenth century, the Srivijaya empire had declined even as the Java-based kingdom of Majapahit was gaining power and Islam was taking root in Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula, shouldering aside the Hindu in fluence of the Srivijaya—though it has remained firmly rooted in the kingdom of Bali. The in fluence of the Srivijaya empire extended to parts of the Philippine archipelago, with Srivijaya colonists, as pointed out earlier, implanting the distinctive name of “Visayas” on its central cluster of islands. By the end of the eighth century, the empire in cluded all of the Malay Peninsula, a large portion of Sumatra, parts of Siam, and central Java. It had four substates—Bandjarmasin, Sukadara, Southern Sarawak, and Brunei. From Bandjarmasin settlers went to Sulu and west-central Visayas; the Borneans sailed to Panay, Palawan, Mindoro, and southern Luzon. Very likely the Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the cultural residue of such migration. Spanish documents from the sixteenth century record the existence of diverse crafts, such as shipbuilding—an absolute must in the archipelago—metallurgy, pottery, and weaving. They noted native weapons of the time as in cluding the lantaka (bronze cannons that were of ten mounted on swivels), lances and daggers tipped with iron, as well as bronze culverins. Metallurgy had long been practiced in the islands, along with dry agriculture, weaving, boat-building, and the construction of elevated lightweight houses with thatched roofs. In Palawan, the Manunggul Cave—part of the Tabon Cave complex—yielded iron objects and the extraordinary Manunggul Jar, described by the late American anthropologist Robert Fox as “perhaps unrivalled in Southeast Asia,” when compared to artifacts of the same era, providing “a clear example of a cultural link between the archaeological past and the ethnographic present.” This remarkable burial jar is made of clay with finely in cised motifs, and dates to the late Neolithic period, or about 710 B. C. E. The jar’s cover depicts two figures on a boat, a rower ferrying the dead person to the next realm, with its implicit belief in the soul and the afterlife. This type of jar was most likely in troduced by the Hakka migrating from southern China’s Fukien region"

Spanish documents from the sixteenth century record the existence of diverse crafts, such as shipbuilding—an absolute must in the archipelago—metallurgy, pottery, and weaving. They noted native weapons of the time as in cluding the lantaka (bronze cannons that were of ten mounted on swivels), lances and daggers tipped with iron, as well as bronze culverins. Metallurgy had long been practiced in the islands, along with dry agriculture, weaving, boat-building, and the construction of elevated lightweight houses with thatched roofs. In Palawan, the Manunggul Cave—part of the Tabon Cave complex—yielded iron objects and the extraordinary Manunggul Jar, described by the late American anthropologist Robert Fox as “perhaps unrivalled in Southeast Asia,” when compared to artifacts of the same era, providing “a clear example of a cultural link between the archaeological past and the ethnographic present.” This remarkable burial jar is made of clay with finely in cised motifs, and dates to the late Neolithic period, or about 710 B. C. E. The jar’s cover depicts two figures on a boat, a rower ferrying the dead person to the next realm, with its implicit belief in the soul and the afterlife. This type of jar was most likely in troduced by the Hakka migrating from southern China’s Fukien region. Metallurgy was also evidenced in fine goldsmithing, with gold jewelry and or naments widespread throughout the archipelago, an in dication of the mineral’s abundance. The Spanish noted the delicacy and high degree of craftsmanship of gold work in the islands, particularly in the Visayas and in certain parts of Mindanao. Fervent capitalists, they complained that the mines were being worked only as needed and never at their maximum. The observant Chirino writes, “The islands are numerous and thickly in habited by a people who, though not rich, were accustomed to wear cotton and silk garments, and gold pieces (not merely of thin plate) and brooches to fasten them; and rich necklaces, pendants, earrings, finger-rings, ankle rings, for the neck, ears, hands, and feet—the men as well as the women. They even used to, and do yet, in sert gold between their teeth as an or nament.” Earlier, in 1521, the Venetian chronicler of the Magellan expedition that had come across the archipelago, Antonio Pigafetta, had noted the existence in some of the islands of “mines of gold, which is found by digging from the earth large pieces as large as walnuts and eggs.” Discoveries in the 1970 s in Surigao, northeastern Mindanao, of more than a thousand gold artifacts dating to the tenth to thirteenth centuries C. E., reflect sophisticated artistry and unusual craftsmanship. Acknowledging outside in fluences, experts on the subject nonetheless have concluded that pre-colonial Philippine techniques and motifs were unique to the islands. Among other items the cache in cluded golden sashes, earrings, diadems, funerary masks, body or naments, and ritual containers. One piece is particularly impressive: a gold halter of nearly four kilograms, quite possibly representing the Sacred Thread, a mark of the Brahmin caste in Hinduism. The halter and other objects with similar motifs clearly reflect Hindu in fluences—cultural reverberations from the Srivijaya empire—underscoring the presence of yet another layer in the archipelago’s diverse and complex pre-Hispanic culture. L IFE, L ANGUAGE, AND L OVE Being home to a diverse array of ethnicities, the islands possess close to 170 languages and dialects, with many on the verge of extinction. Nevertheless, the Austronesian language tree is the dominant source of the Philippines’ eight major to ngues—Cebuano, Tagalog, Hiligaynon, Waray, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Bicolano, and Kapampangan. Evidence in dicates that Austronesian languages came to the Philippine archipelago earlier than they did, say, to the Malay Peninsula. By the sixteenth century, to day’s languages were well established, evolving from their Austronesian roots to their distinct for mations as a result of the conditions peculiar to the islands. Tagalog, the lingua franca of historic Manila, capital of colonial times (both of Spain and the United States), forms the basis of the national language, Pilipino—much to the dismay of Cebuano speakers who outnumber native Tagalog speakers, and who remind anyone who listens that Cebu was where the Spanish first set up a settlement. In terms of script, at least ten syllabaries are known to have been used in pre- colonial Philippines, though literacy was not widespread, even if a number of Spanish accounts like Chirino’s say so. Tagalog script probably in fluenced the development of writing among the Visayans, whose pre-1565 culture stressed singing and chanting, relying on oral history for the transmission of tradition. Such practices occasioned socializing, and reinforced a barangay’s joie de vivre —antedating by several hundred years that contemporary and widely popular and communal form, the karaoke songfest. In Maynila, its datus wrote in the Kawi script, which seems to have disappeared by the time of Spanish conquest. They now wrote in a Malay or Arabic script called baybayin, as ment ioned earlier, since they corresponded with the Sultan of Borneo—an in dication of Islamic conversion up north, not only in Maynila but in other areas such as Batangas in the southern Tagalog region. Historian Corpuz believes that “the presence of writing and the making of written laws in the Manila area placed Manila ahead of other native communities in political development at the time of the Spanish contact, with the exception only of the Sulu and Maguindanao areas.” Unlike the sudden impact of the Spanish, extra-in sular cultural in fluences seeped in gradually, with none of the in tensity of other cultural encounters elsewhere in Southeast Asia, where Buddhism and Hinduism led the charge. Not surprising, as the more than 7,000 islands were on the northeastern edge of Southeast Asia. As noted earlier, pre-Hispanic Filipinos proved to be as peripatetic as anyone else, with small settlements in Malacca, Brunei, and Timor. They even fought as mercenaries in the employ of the Burmese kingdom. Given the abundance of and easy access to water, and the warm climate, the islanders were at tentive to matters of personal hygiene, especially to bathing— impressing both Pigafetta and Chirino. Chirino wrote admiringly: Both men and women swim like fishes, even from childhood, and have no need of bridges to pass over rivers. They bathe the mselves at all hours, for cleanliness and recreation; and the women after childbirth do not refrain from the bath, and children just born are bathed in the rivers and springs of cold water.

Given the abundance of and easy access to water, and the warm climate, the islanders were at tentive to matters of personal hygiene, especially to bathing— impressing both Pigafetta and Chirino. Chirino wrote admiringly: Both men and women swim like fishes, even from childhood, and have no need of bridges to pass over rivers. They bathe the mselves at all hours, for cleanliness and recreation; and the women after childbirth do not refrain from the bath, and children just born are bathed in the rivers and springs of cold water. When leaving the bath, they anoint the head with ajonjoli [i. e., oil of sesame] mixed with civet…. Through modesty, they bathe with their bodies drawn up and almost in a sitting posture, taking the greatest care not to be seen, although no one may be near to see them [except perhaps for the odd priest]. The most general hour for bathing is at the setting of the sun, because at that time they have finished their labors, and bathe in the river to rest and refresh the mselves; on the way, they usually carry some vessel for bearing water to use in their domestic duties. Visayans used citrus in laundering their garments, for the pleasant odor it imparted. They were fastidious, Scott notes, in their personal hygiene, using swabs to clean their ears and “vegetable husk for cleaning and polishing the teeth.” Unlike Legazpi, Chirino was impressed by the civility, courteousness, and upbringing of the Tagalogs, particularly in the use of the third person when addressing someone. Chirino was less taken by the Visayans, who “are more rustic and less civil in manners, just as their language is harsher and less polished.” On the other hand, Pigafetta commends the Visayans for their hospitality, graciousness, love of feasting, and music. It could very well have been a matter of in dividual temperament—Pigafetta more at tuned to worldliness than the priest—or Chirino having a bad day in his in teraction with the Visayans. Not surprisingly, both Pigafetta and the good Jesuit noted the relaxed at titude to wards sex, especially among the women. The pious cleric disapproved heartily of island hedonism. He believed that the devil had convinced women that their salvation was in the hands of men, “that a woman, whether married or single, could not be saved, who did not have some lover…. Consequently, virginity was not recognized or esteemed among them; rather, women considered it as a misfortune and humiliation. Married women, moreover, were not constrained by honor to remain faithful to their husbands, although the latter would resent the adultery, and hold it as just cause for repudiating the wife.” Pigafetta, no stranger to his shipmates’ earlier bacchanals in South America, gave a more detailed, at times, clinical, description of the islanders’ sexual mores, leading one to in fer that, being a scrupulous observer, he had witnessed Cebuanos in actual coitus and perhaps he had availed himself of the charms of the unmarried nubile women, whose beauty he remarked on: “These girls were very beautiful, and almost white and tall as ours. They were naked, except that from the waist to the knees they wore a garment … covering their nature.” Sexual pleasure, it seemed, was seen as a mutual goal—women were as important as men in this regard—rather than simply for the gratification of male desire and the propagation of the species. To that end, to please their partners, according to Pigafetta, men “have their penis pierced from one side to the other near the head, with a gold or tin bolt as large as a goose quill…. Some have what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends; others are like the head of a cart nail.” He goes on: “When the men wish to have communication with their women, the latter the mselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence very gently to in troduce it, with the spur on top first, and then the other part. When it is in side, it takes its regular position; and thus the penis always stays in side until it gets soft, for otherwise they could not pull it out.” Two lovers could thus remain locked in passion for hours, even a whole day. In this context, virginity was neither prized nor desirable, and polygamy was accepted—both of which practices the zealously Catholic Spanish at tempted to and did for the most part wipe out. To the macho Spanish, a sexually in dependent woman was in to lerable. One account described island women as “generally depraved … given to abominable lustful habits.” The fact that female desire was given equal weight profoundly disturbed the repressed and repressive Spanish patriarchs. Gender equality was evident in a language such as Tagalog with its nongendered nominative pronouns and in the prevalent creation myth that had man and woman as emerging from bamboo at the same time, both fully for med. In contrast to the biblical story of the creation of Adam and Eve, this one held the implicit promise of nonsexist gender treatment, as manifest in the sexual at titudes that titillated and shocked the Europeans. Variations on the creation myth in cluded both sexes arising from green coconuts, or as the result of an argument between primeval sky and water. The Tagalogs, Visayans, and the Igorots expressed belief in a supreme deity, as of course did the Muslims in the south. To the Tagalogs this god was known as Bathala May Kapal (“Bathala” is likely derived from the Sanskrit word for noble lord, Batthara ); to the Visayans, Laon; and to the Igorots, Kabunian. They also believed in lesser deities, such as those ruling over seas and rivers. The crocodile, once plentiful in the archipelago’s waterways, was revered, with of ferings to ssed on the water to placate its ravenous appetite. The Visayans termed the lower-ranked powers diwata (from the Sanskrit deva ), among them Magwayen, who ferried the dead to the afterlife; Makabosog, a Bacchus-like deity who in spired humans to prodigious bouts of eating and drinking; and a mischievous trio of expert poisoners—Naginid, Arapayan, and Makbarubak. Inhabiting the netherworld were frightful creatures such as the aswang, flesh eaters, and the manananggal, literally a fly-by-night ghoul that would leave half of its body in a secret place, while the other, upper half would move through the dark sky in search of a victim, preferably the fetus of an expectant mother, which it would then suck out, with its long, needle-like to ngue.

Acting as in termediary between this world and the unseen one was the babaylan ( katalonan to the Tagalogs, mumbaki to the highlanders of Luzon). This in dividual could be of either sex but was more of ten female, though the male babaylan were known for cross-dressing. The babaylan’s most common function was a diviner of fate. In a public ritual common to both lowlander and highlander, a sacrificial swine, preferably reddish in color, was killed by a quick, unerring thrust to its heart by the babaylan/katolonan/mumbaki who had gone into a trance. The pig’s entrails would be read, then consumed, with certain parts reserved for the seer. As a medium for spirits and practitioner of sacred rites, the babaylan occupied an important, and lucrative, position in the barangay. S/he acted also as medicine wo/man, midwife, dispenser of herbs and potions that healed the physical wounds, or of charms and in cantations if a person’s illness, or bad for tune, were thought to be the result of a hex put upon him or her—possibly by another babaylan more at tuned to black than white magic. As with the Spanish and their Southeast Asian neighbors, the pre-Hispanic populations believed in an afterlife, recognized the existence of in visible spirits, and feared demons, all of which were thought to significantly affect their lives. Many of their beliefs were animistic, at tributing supernatural power to elements of Nature. One basis for their sense of the otherworldly was the need to honor and respect their ancestors, whom they would sometimes elevate to deity status. Thus, they reverenced stones, the wind, headlands of water, and trees. To cut down an old tree, for example, was considered a sacrilege. Or to fail to ask permission to pass in front of an ant mound in a field was tantamount to in viting retribution (usually in the form of a mischievous trick) from the mound’s resident spirit, to which the Spanish word duende was affixed, though the meaning was closer to that of leprechaun than of creative spirit. Often, beside a house, would be a much smaller one, that contained some to ols and handicrafts but was also dedicated to an anito, or a local deity—similar to the shrines for the penates, household gods of the Romans, and the spirit houses of the Thais. The Ifugao carved wooden icons they called the bulul, a guardian deity of in determinate sex that stood guard over their warehouses of rice and was even thought to in crease the supply of stored grain. As exemplified by the Manunggul Jar, shuffling off this mortal coil meant a journey of the spirit to the next realm. Upon a person’s death, the corpse was prepared in different ways in anticipation of its voyage. In the Tagalog regions, the body was decorated and dressed in finery. In the highlands of northern Luzon, depending on the tribe, burial rites ranged from the placement of coffins in the vaulted ceilings of caves to mummification. In one region, the corpse was cleaned, dressed, set upright on and bound to a chair as members of the clan gathered around to mourn the person’s demise. There was no cemetery as such, and the dead could be buried in the ground underneath the house, usually elevated on hardwood posts, or in the fields. On occasion, with the death of someone of high status, such as a datu, slaves captured in raids were in terred as well. The manner of death may have differed —sometimes speared to death while tied to crosses, sometimes crushed by a boat that would roll over their prostrate bodies—but the in tent was the same: for the dead slaves to accompany the master on the new voyage, as they had when he was among the living. The soul or spirit of the deceased person wandered in another realm but could return, in which case those left behind made preparations to welcome that spirit. In a practical vein, the family would try to put that spirit to use in divining what the future might hold and otherwise putting in a good word, or in tervening, to assure the bestowal of good, and the avoidance of ill, for tune. At the wake, if the family could afford it, professional mourners would sing songs, eulogizing the deceased and relating, according to Chirino, “the fabulous genealogies and vain deeds of their gods.” T HE C RESCENT B EFORE THE C ROSS Islam predated the arrival of Christianity by at least a century and a half. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, Muslim missionaries from the by then mostly Islamicized Malaysia and Indonesia brought the word of the Messenger concerning Allah to the southern Philippines, even reaching Palawan, Mindoro, and the east coast of Luzon, notably Maynila. With ulamas, or Muslim communities, taking root, two large sultanates were subsequently established: in Sulu in the fifteenth century, under Sharif ul-Hashim, and in Maguindanao, near Cotabato City in the early sixteenth century, under Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan, who had left Malacca for Maguindanao. Thence, Islam spread to Maranao territory (around Lake Danao), in explicably skipped the Visayas for the most part, and sailed north to Mindoro Island and Maynila and Batangas in Luzon, and west to southern Palawan. Converted in digenous tribes such as the Tausug, Maranaoans, and Maguindanaoans could look to the older ulamas farther south. Certainly there were other outside in fluences, mainly from China and India, and their legacies can be seen in such diverse areas as language, art, cuisine, and kinship groupings, but Islam acted as a catalyst for in tra-settlement alliances and the beginnings of a civil state.

This feature, which distinguished the Muslim communities from the non-Muslim ones, proved essential in resisting Spanish efforts at colonizing southern Mindanao. Writing in 1603 to the Spanish king of the paramount Muslim datus of Mindanao—Umpi, Silonga, Buycan, and Rajaniora—Don Pedro de Acuña noted, “They have usually dissensions and controversies among the mselves, for he who has the most people and wealth seeks to be more esteemed than the others. But against the Spaniards and their other enemies, they confederate and unite, and or dinarily Silonga has the most power.” The sultanate had a centralized government similar to Islamic states in Borneo and Indonesia. Its head, the sultan, was owed allegiance by other datus. Though the latter governed their own followers, they occupied a subordinate position vis à vis the sultan, who alone could declare war, engage in dealings with other states, and otherwise decide on matters affecting the sultanate as a whole. The highly ceremonial courts in both Sulu and Maguindanao had Arabic speakers, religious scholars, and gentry with distinguished lineages. Clearly Muslim, still, these courts didn’t completely disavow pre-Islamic practices. As Scott puts it in Barangay, “Maguindanao ruled over a great many pagan people, and even the celebrated [Sultan] Kudarat was reported to have sacrificed three of his household slaves during a terrifying volcanic eruption.” With Islamicized communities spread strategically through the archipelago, from Luzon in the north, Sulu and Maguindanao in the south, and Palawan in the west, a persuasive argument can be and has been made that the archipelago would have evolved to wards an Islamic state or states, either as an in dependent nation, or part, say, of Indonesia or Malaysia, were it not for the Iberians. Spanish colonization meant the displacement of the crescent by the cross in most of the country. T HE C HINESE AND O THER M INORITIES As early at least as the tenth century, Chinese traders were regular visitors to the islands, going by the first ment ion of a Philippine island—Ma-Yi, current-day Mindoro—in extant Chinese records, which list 985, 1372, 1406, and 1410, as years of contact with the islands. Place names, such as Ma-Yi, Min-to-liang, Su- lu, and Lu-sung, in dicate recurring visits, with small Han communities springing up. In his accounts from the thirteenth century, Chao Ju-Kua, China’s Superintendent of Sea Trade from 1277 to 1287, referred to Ma-Yi (here taken to in dicate the Philippine archipelago), San-hsii (the Visayas) and Lin-hsing (Luzon). Imports from Southeast Asia, in cluding from the Philippines, in cluded cotton, yellow wax, coconuts, on ions and woven mats. But the steady and continuing in flux of the Chinese in larger numbers began only in earnest with the colonization of the archipelago by the Spanish, who needed the crafts and skills of Chinese artisans. To the Chinese traders—most if not all of whom were from the southern China coastal provinces such as Fujian, Amoy, and Guangdong—this meant a link to yet another trading network as well as access to sought-after Mexican silver, brought by the Spanish from Mexico. Both silver and new markets were accessible because of the profitable galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco, the transshipment point to Spain and the rest of Europe. (The galleon trade will be discussed in the next chapter.) The very nature of the archipelago, with more water than land, meant the existence of numerous tribal groups, other than the dominant ones—the Tagalogs, the Kapampangans, the Ilocanos, the Bicolanos, the Cebuanos, and other Visayans. Now known as cultural minorities, some sixty of them were and are to be found, still, throughout the country. Due to remoteness or effective resistance, they had limited contact with the Spanish. The Muslims of Mindanao, alert against Spanish encroachment, were the mselves composed mostly of three distinct tribes: the Maranaoans, the Maguindanaoans, and the Taosug, Islam being the religious glue that bound them, albeit loosely but never too loosely as to prevent unity (most of the time, anyway) against the Iberian foe. Other cultural minorities in Mindanao, especially those in the southern regions, such as the boat-dwelling Badjao, the Sama Laut, and the Yakan, were subject to pressure to convert to Islam. And for the most part they did. Tribes such as the T’Boli, the Mandaya, the Manobo, and the Bagobo, because they lived in the highlands, never converted wholesale to Islam. In Mindoro Island, off the western coast of Luzon, live the Mangyan in the rugged, mountainous in terior, whose Hanunoo branch was ment ioned earlier in connection with the use of baybayin, the pre-Hispanic script. Scattered along the western coast of Luzon, especially in its mountainous in terior, and found on some Visayan islands, are the Negritos (whom the Spanish also referred to as Negrillos ). Also known as Agta, Aeta, Ita, Ati, they are shorter than the average Filipino, of dark pigmentation and curly hair, and are related to the Australian Aborigines. There is an on going debate as to when they established the mselves in the archipelago, but their presence is believed to be older than that of the Austronesian migrations. They are thought to have used land bridges 30,000 years ago, most likely through the isthmus that once connected Palawan Island and Borneo. In the highlands of northern Luzon—the Cordilleras—live the previously ment ioned Igorot tribes, Igorot meaning “peoples of the mountain.” Among these are the Kalinga, the Bontoc, the Kankanay, the Ibaloi, and the Ifugao—the last named the builders of the magnificent rice terraces"

Scattered along the western coast of Luzon, especially in its mountainous in terior, and found on some Visayan islands, are the Negritos (whom the Spanish also referred to as Negrillos ). Also known as Agta, Aeta, Ita, Ati, they are shorter than the average Filipino, of dark pigmentation and curly hair, and are related to the Australian Aborigines. There is an on going debate as to when they established the mselves in the archipelago, but their presence is believed to be older than that of the Austronesian migrations. They are thought to have used land bridges 30,000 years ago, most likely through the isthmus that once connected Palawan Island and Borneo. In the highlands of northern Luzon—the Cordilleras—live the previously ment ioned Igorot tribes, Igorot meaning “peoples of the mountain.” Among these are the Kalinga, the Bontoc, the Kankanay, the Ibaloi, and the Ifugao—the last named the builders of the magnificent rice terraces. Famed for their martial skills, bravery, and codes of honor and retribution (in cluding headhunting), the Igorots were too high up, too fierce, and the Spanish too sparse in number, for the few at tempts at spreading the Gospel to succeed. Only under United States colonial rule in the early twentieth century would Christianity gain a foothold in the mountains."

EXPEDITIONS, ENTRENCHMENT, AND SPANISH COLONIAL RULE, 1521-1862 “The method which they pursued was consistent with the practice of those nations in for ming a friendship—a method not altogether their own, as it was a custom among the most ancient heathen peoples, ment ion of which we find in serious authors. Those who made peace in the name of the rest, and established the pacts of perpetual friendship, pricked and wounded their own arms; the Indian sucking the blood of the Spaniard, and the Spaniard that of the Indian. In this wise they became as if of the same blood, and were closer than brothers. These are called sandugo, which means ‘consanguineous,’ or ‘of the same blood.’” —Pedro Chirino, S. J., Relación de las Islas Filipinas, 1604 I N 1517, AN INTREPID AND BATTLE-TESTED THIRTY-NINE-YEAR-OLD Portuguese navigator by the name of Ferdinand Magellan, out of favor with the crotchety Portuguese King Manuel, crossed the border into Spain and convinced its young, adventurous seventeen-year-old Hapsburg monarch, Charles, to finance an ambitious undertaking: He, Magellan, would discover a new route to the fabled Spice Islands by sailing west across the Atlantic, to South America, from where he could then sail to the desired destination with out running afoul of his countrymen, Spain’s fiercest rivals. Magellan assured the Spanish court that his voyage would observe the line of demarcation Pope Alexander VI had drawn, essentially dividing the planet between Catholic Spain and Catholic Portugal. Established on June 7, 1494, the demarcation was one hundred leagues west of the Azores and Cape Verde: All lands west were marked for Spain; east, for Portugal. However, if land in either half was already ruled by a Christian sovereign, it was to be left alone. Everything else was up for grabs. A simple enough agreement, yet the papal bull was constantly challenged to suit the agenda either of the Portuguese or the Spanish. This in terminable wrangling led to modifications through the 1506 Treaty of Tordesillas (a small town in northern Spain). The line was moved 370 miles west of Cape Verde, approximately in the middle of the Atlantic. The papal blessing provided Spain and Portugal with the ological cover for their voyages of conquest and the brutal but profitable undertaking of land expropriation and exploitation of in digenous peoples, otherwise known as colonization. Through the conquistadors and the civil and religious personnel that followed in lockstep, Rome extended its reach wherever these two European countries planted their flags—a perfect combination of economic enterprise, worldly power, and religious zeal. Magellan’s voyage was financed of ficially by the Casa de Contratacíon in Seville. If the venture succeeded, it would guarantee much needed revenue for the Spanish treasury. On August 10, 1519, the flagship Trinidad, the Victoria, San Antonio, C on cepcíon, Santiago, and 260 men under the command of Magellan slipped their berths at Seville and sailed down the Rio Guadalquivir and into the Atlantic. Accompanying the voyage was Antonio Pigafetta, a young and healthy Venetian nobleman eager for adventure, whose journals of the expedition constitute the main source of what we know to day about this precedent-setting expedition. After an epic voyage filled with extraordinary adventures, hardships, maritime disasters, and a mutiny that nearly succeeded, the fleet, reduced to three, discovered the straits, now bearing Magellan’s name, that lead to the Pacific Ocean—so christened by Magellan as his expedition happened upon that great body of water, when the storm season hadn’t yet begun. Entering the vast and calm ocean, the ships tacked their way across for more than three months with out being able to reprovision—causing untold hardships and deaths—before sighting the Marianas (present-day Guam) on March 6, 1521. Magellan and his men named it Isla de Ladrones (Isle of Thieves), for the in habitants’ light- fingered proclivities, though the in habitants, for ebears of latter-day Chamorros, had been generous with their food. (This could have simply been a case of cultural misunderstanding: what the Europeans considered theft, the islanders thought of as sharing.) In punishment, Magellan or dered his men to burn some of the natives’ homes, killing seven men as a result. According to Pigafetta’s account, crew members who were ill asked that the entrails of a dead man be brought to them, “for immediately they would be healed”—a request that suggests pre-Christian beliefs coexisting with Christian ones on board. Magellan and his men pushed on and, on March 16, 1521, came across Homonhon, an isle off the Pacific-facing coast of Samar, a much larger island in the archipelago yet to be named the Philippines. The ships had sailed into the eastern flank of the Visayas, the archipelago’s central region. That day being the feast day of a saint, Magellan christened the islands aptly enough the Archipelago of San Lazaro, as the for tuitous landfall meant a revival of their lives, if not their for tunes. The Visayans, whom the Iberians subsequently referred to as pintados, for the elaborate tattoos that marked them, proved hospitable. From Homonhon the expedition proceeded to the island of Limasawa south of Samar. There several large boats approached the ships, boats that Pigafetta noted were called balanghai and that on the average measured approximately eighteen meters long. Pigafetta, whose journals provide a fascinating, first-hand account of this historic voyage, loved to make lists, and in one, he enumerated words from the language of the islanders—words that are used to this day. In another, he itemized products and domestic animals he had come across, among them: rice, ginger, or anges, lemons, sugar cane, garlic, honey, bananas, corn, millet, citrus, wax, goats, chickens, dogs, cats, and pigs. In addition, there were cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg—all valuable spices—as well as, and more importantly, gold. He noted the practice of betel-nut chewing and cockfighting—both common in Southeast Asia. But of all the tropical produce that Pigafetta got to know, it was the coconut that so enchanted him he deemed it the near-perfect food. He was convinced two trees could sustain a family of ten for a hundred years. On Easter Sunday, in a portent of impending Christianity, the priest accompanying the expedition celebrated mass on Limasawa. Thence, guided by Limasawa’s datu (a lesser-ranked ally of the datu of Butuan, the much larger port in Mindanao, further south), the ships proceeded to the busy port city of Cebu, arriving on April 7.

Acting as the translator and in terpreter was Magellan’s Christianized Malayan slave, Enrique de Malacca—Malacca being the port and slave market where Magellan had bought him. Malacca was Southeast Asia’s principal entrepot, a vital transshipping port in the trade routes that extended on one end from the Mediterranean to southern China, at the other. Enrique may not necessarily have been from Malacca, or from the Moluccas. The young man, as it turned out, not only looked like these pre-colonial Filipinos, he also spoke their to ngue. He may very well have been from the central part of the archipelago. And in deed, if he were, this slave (whom Magellan in his will decreed be set free upon his death) would the refore have been the first known in dividual to have completed a circuit of the Earth before Sebastian Elcano and the few survivors of the Magellan expedition returned to Sevilla in 1522. Cebu was ruled by Rajah Humabon. After a short period of unease between the pragmatic native king and the imperious navigator—the for mer had in itially demanded tribute from the latter, as was traditionally expected from ships bringing goods—the two sides settled into what presumably was an amicable relationship. It helped that a Muslim trader from Siam, knowing something about the rather brutal history of conquistadors, had advised Humabon to come to some sort of accommodation with Magellan. Consequently, Rajah Humabon agreed to an alliance with Spain, wherein the rajah not only acknowledged Spanish sovereignty but also converted to the Catholic faith, along with his principal consort and his subjects. Humabon was baptized Carlos, after the Spanish monarch, and Humabon’s queen, Juana, after Carlos’s mother, Juana la Loca (Joanna the Mad, so named for her ment al in stability and her bizarre, fetishistic desire to keep the corpse of her husband Philip the Handsome close by her). Newly converted, Humabon complained to Magellan about a petty ruler from nearby Mactan Island—across the straits from Cebu—by the name of Lapu Lapu who would not bow to either the cross or the Spanish crown. Given the highly decentralized nature of Southeast Asian chiefdoms and competition for trade, Humabon may very well have enlisted the unsuspecting Magellan in a strategy to get rid of his rival. Despite the sage advice of his of ficers, who rightfully pointed out that they had no business in terfering in local affairs, and, more importantly, feared losing all their hard-earned gains, Magellan decided to teach Lapu Lapu a lesson, with only sixty men—all volunteers—in three long boats, and in the process impress his native ally no end. Magellan had by now been in fected with evangelical zeal, his head full of grandiose notions of lording it over the archipelago. Being viceroy of the islands would have made him and his family unbelievably rich and vindicated his defection to the Spanish court. Humabon of fered Magellan a contingent of his warriors, but Magellan disdained the of fer, boasting that one of his men, clad in body armor, was worth a hundred of the enemy. He had earlier arranged a display showing his armored men repelling blows. Besides, his ships’ cannon were larger and more powerful than the lantakas, or artillery, of the enemy. It was an empty boast: as dawn broke on April 27, 1521, Magellan and his armed party of sixty waded ashore on Mactan and there engaged Lapu Lapu and his men. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered—Lapu Lapu had tricked his enemies into coming in at low tide, so the Spanish ships were anchored too far out for their cannon to be effective— the to ugh, forty-one-year-old Magellan paid for his adventurism with his life, cut down on the beach as his companions, their ranks depleted, fled to the longboats. Pigafetta, who had fought that day, mourned Magellan’s death, calling him “our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide.” The aftermath of the battle was bloody as well. Enrique, wounded at the battle on Mactan, had been humiliated by Duarte Barbosa, now one of the two leaders of the expedition (the other being João Serrão), who refused to give him his freedom, as promised in Magellan’s will. Enrique convinced Humabon to in vite the of ficers and crew to a banquet. There, in a scene worthy of Shakespeare, Humabon’s guards slaughtered twenty-six of them, in cluding Barbosa. Humabon was willing to have Serrão ransomed for the gifts the rajah had given Magellan, but João Carvalho, who had escaped the massacre and assumed command, refused. Serrão, according to Pigafetta, “prayed God that at the day of judgment he would demand his soul of his friend João Carvalho.” The survivors sailed off in the three ships, but scuttled one off the waters of Bohol Island, leaving only the Victoria and the Trinidad. And only the Victoria, of the or iginal five, completed the circumnavigation of the globe, limping into Sanlúcar de Barrameda in 1522, three years after the expedition set out. Just eighteen of the or iginal complement of 260 men survived. With Sebastian Elcano as the pilot, the crew was said to have been the first to circumnavigate the globe.

Few survived, only eight returning to Spain in 1536, in cluding Andrés de Urdaneta, who would return with the Legazpi expedition. As directed and or ganized by Hernán Cortés, famed conqueror of the Aztec empire, the second expedition of three ships and 110 men, under the command of Alvaro de Saavedra, departed Mexico in 1527—the first Spanish voyage to Asia launched from the New World. Saavedra bore a royal letter for the ruler of Cebu, apologizing for Magellan’s conduct and at the same time seeking to ransom any Spanish prisoners the good rajah might be holding. But only one ship reached Mindanao. Unable to locate Cebu, Saavedra sailed to Tidore in the Moluccas, where, meeting the remnants of the Loaísa expedition, he and his men were taken captive by the Portuguese. Released, he set sail for Mexico, but died at sea. In the meantime, under the Treaty of Zaragoza of 1529—yet another renegotiation of the line of demarcation—Madrid gave up its claims to the Moluccas in return for 350,000 ducats from the Portuguese. Being west of this demarcation, the Philippines was the or etically within the ambit of Portugal, but Spanish at tempts to colonize the archipelago did not cease, nor did Portuguese harassment of the Spanish, until it became clear that the Spanish had successfully colonized the islands. The third expedition, made up of six ships and 300 men, set sail from Navidad, Mexico, on November 1, 1542, under Ruy López de Villalobos. After landfall in Palau and the Carolinas, the expedition arrived at the east coast of Mindanao in 1543. In Sarangani, the men started a colony, but lack of food for ced them to sail to Tidore, where, not surprisingly, the Portuguese held them captive, and where Villalobos expired, at tended to by the brilliant Jesuit missionary and future saint, Francis Xavier, later to head to Japan, the nce to China, on pioneering evangelical missions. It was the Villalobos expedition that christened the islands Filipinas, after Felipe, the son of Charles I. The final and most successful expedition was commanded by Miguel López de Legazpi, a Spanish Basque conquistador who had arrived in Mexico in 1530 and prospered. By the time of the Legazpi voyage, Crown Prince Felipe, or Philip II, had grown up and now occupied the Spanish throne. A zealous Catholic and partisan of Mary, Queen of Scots, claimant to England’s throne, he detested the English Protestant Queen Elizabeth. In 1588, Philip assembled a mighty fleet of warships, known simply as the Spanish Armada, consisting of 130 ships, with 8,000 sailors and 18,000 soldiers. Its purpose was to in vade England, but Philip’s much-vaunted armada was humiliated by the British navy in a series of engagements. The royal treasury had in curred tremendous expenses in assembling the Armada, and new sources of revenue, such as the Philippines promised, would be in valuable. Legazpi’s mission, as all the previous ones, was to secure a base in Southeast Asia and the nce establish a route back to Mexico, so that precious cargo could be transported sans in terference from the Portuguese. As with the other would-be conquistadors, Legazpi would be richly rewarded with money, trade concessions, and land. In the agreement between the Spanish monarch and the conquistadores, the Crown reserved certain rights in the colonies while the latter enjoyed the spoils of conquest. Thus, the desire for riches and prestige furnished powerful in centives for the men who undertook such dangerous expeditions, as they did for the royal court. Legazpi’s expedition left Navidad on November 21, 1564. Urdaneta, now a member of the Augustinian or der, was coaxed out of retirement from a monastery in Mexico to pilot successfully the fleet to Cebu. (On board were six other members of the Augustinian Order, the first to undertake the Christianization of the islands.) Urdaneta then returned to Mexico in 1565, charting the route to be used in the galleon trade between Manila and Mexico that would be the new colony’s financial lifeline for two centuries. Other key members of the Legazpi expedition were Martín De Goiti, Legazpi’s grandson Juan de Salcedo, and Miguel de Loarca, who was to write Relación de las Islas Filipinas, a detailed account of his stay in the Philippines. Legazpi and his men began a sustained and ultimately successful effort to colonize the islands, with the Spanish Basque becoming the first governor general of this latest addition to the Spanish Empire. Guided by Spanish colonial experience in both Americas and decrees from Madrid, Legazpi, as well as his successors, devised and enacted certain measures for the pacification and administrative control of the archipelago and to strengthen and protect Spanish sovereignty from enemies within and with out. The colonial apparatus set in place was in tended primarily to facilitate the exploitation, rather than the progressive development, of the islands for the benefit of the Crown and, in the process, enrich those who had claimed and ruled the territory on behalf of the monarch. From the outset the in digenous population was viewed through the prism of racism and a deeply held sense of cultural superiority. Unfortunately, having to deal with an in ferior race was the cost of doing business. Legazpi, like Magellan, in itially based himself in Cebu, which the Spanish christened Santissimo Nombre de Jesus or the Most Holy Name of Jesus after a statue of the Santo Niño, or Holy Infant, a gift from Magellan to Rajah Humabon’s Queen Juana, was found by a soldier in a hut.

Harassed by the Portuguese, who believed that the islands fell within their side of the demarcation, Legazpi moved to nearby and more easily defended Panay Island. Seeking, as Magellan did, to strengthen his alliance with local datus, Legazpi entered into a blood compact in March 1565 with two chiefs of Bohol Island, Datu Sikatuna and Datu Sigala. It was a move precipitated by the fact that two years earlier, in 1563, according to Legazpi’s account of the voyage, the Portuguese had, under the guise of friendship, plundered Bohol. The datus and their followers were the refore understandably wary of these strangers who resembled the Portuguese. Hearing of a larger settlement up north blessed with an excellent bay, on the island of Luzon, Legazpi sent an exploratory mission, under the command of Goiti and De Salcedo. That settlement was Maynila, at the mouth of the Pasig River, its ruler Rajah Suleiman. Maynila was a large, for tified port, with cannons for ged in foundries right by Suleiman’s royal compound. The Pasig was an important artery leading to the lush lands east and south of Maynila, as well as to the country’s largest freshwater lake, later named Laguna de Bay, and passage upriver required tribute paid to Maynila’s ruler. Prior to 1565, Muslim port communities had already established the mselves north of Mindanao, in Mindoro, and in Luzon, principally in the Maynila region and in what is now the province of Pampanga. The datus in Maynila and Tondo (across the river) were converts to the Muslim faith. Loarca noted that the river delta in habitants were Moros — the Spanish word for “Moors,” or Muslims—and that they had the art of writing, in dicative of the fact that pre-Hispanic Maynilans possessed not only their own script, but were aware of Bornean and Arabic writing. The Goiti mission made overtures to Rajah Suleiman, but suspicious of the Spanish, the rajah rejected these, and in evitably fighting broke out. Goiti emerged triumphant and Maynila was burned to the ground. On the departure of the Spanish for Panay, however, Suleiman and his men returned to rebuild the port. The next year, 1571, the Spanish returned, this time with Legazpi himself in command of a larger force that in cluded twenty-seven boats (most supplied by the Visayans), 280 Spaniards, and a contingent of pintados, or Visayan warriors. Rather than yield, Suleiman or dered Maynila razed once more. Later on Suleiman would assemble a coalition of like-minded datus from barangays in nearby Bulacan and Pampanga, but the native force was decisively defeated. With Suleiman’s defeat, on June 3, 1572, Maynila was designated the seat of Spanish power in the islands, its name streamlined to Manila. Strategically located and fronting a magnificent bay with a natural, deep- water harbor, Manila was granted a royal charter, which described it as the “distinguished and ever loyal city of Manila.” Inhabitants of the new city were to be limited to Spaniards. In the process of this gentrification-cum-segregation, the native residents—disparagingly called “Indios”—were for ced to resettle elsewhere. Manila was to become the capital of the newest colony, made up of Luzon, Visayas, and parts of Mindanao. While the colony was for mally named “El Nuevo Reyno de Castilla,” most preferred the easier-to-say Filipinas, and that is what stuck. Acquiring its own coat-of-arms, Manila was planned as a European-type city, with a grid of streets and a main plaza, around which were to be the cathedral and various important public edifices. Sites were designated for monasteries, schools, and hospitals, as well as for a fort (the extant Fort Santiago), which would have its own smaller plaza. By 1603, for midable stone walls and a moat encircled the city, hence the name of Intramuros. By then there were approximately 600 houses within, while another 600 houses were located with out. One estimate of the archipelago’s population at the time put it at close to a million—a low-population density (Sumatra alone had a population of 2,400,000). Probable causes of this were the agricultural labor expected of women, abortion, disease, and warfare. With Manila now in Spanish hands, and with smaller Spanish settlements in Cebu and Panay, Legazpi turned to the business of expanding and consolidating Spanish sovereignty. His in trepid grandson Juan De Salcedo headed an expeditionary force that traveled as far south as the Bicol Peninsula, along the way winning some 26,000 Tagalogs over to the Spanish Crown, in variably by persuading their local datus that it was in their in terest to be allies rather than foes. In Paracale, Bicol, they came across what every conquistador dreams of: gold mines. Subsequently, Legazpi or dered De Salcedo north, where, with the aid of Rajah Lakandula, ruler of Tondo and uncle of the impetuous Suleiman, he was no less successful, putting down resistance in the provinces of Zambales, Pangasinan, and the Ilocos region. During his sojourn in the tribal lands of the Ilocanos, Villa Fernandina (named in honor of Fernando, eldest son of Philip II) was founded. It is now the city of Vigan, capital of the province of Ilocos Sur. Though harried by the Portuguese, perhaps the greatest threat to early Spanish dominion came from the seagoing Chinese warlord Limahong, who appeared off Manila in late 1574, commanding a flotilla of sixty-two warships, 2,000 warriors, and as many seamen, along with artisans, farmers, and women. By this time, Legazpi had died of a heart at tack, succeeded by Guido de Lavezares. Confident that he could overwhelm the Spanish, Limahong sent an at tack force of 600 men, commanded by his Japanese lieutenant with the Sinicized name of Sioco. Working their way from the city’s southern environs, Sioco and his men laid waste to the to wns in their path, among them Malate, now a neighborhood of modern Manila"

In this in itial encounter, Martín Goiti was killed, but his and his men’s stubborn resistance gained time for Manila’s defenders. The Chinese force assaulted Manila but were repulsed by the garrison there. De Salcedo, who had in the meantime marched south from Vigan—or Villa Fernandina, which he had been granted as an encomienda or district over which an appointed Spaniard ruled—arrived to take over the defense of the city just before Limahong himself, still confident of victory, landed with the bulk of his men. Complicating matters was a revolt threatened by Rajah Lakandula and Rajah Suleiman, as the conflict with Limahong loomed. The two rulers felt their prerogatives as chiefs were being ignored by the Spanish. De Salcedo won them over by promises of reforms and concessions. Together with his Filipino allies, de Salcedo and the battle-tested Spanish soldiers beat Limahong’s army back to their ships. The Chinese warlord sailed up the northwestern coast to Pangasinan, perhaps thinking to settle there, but Salcedo and his by now larger force pursued and destroyed the Chinese fleet, though Limahong escaped. The Spanish weren’t the only ones desirous of seeing the corsair dead. The Chinese imperial government had sent over a high-ranking of ficial in 1575 to request the repatriation of Limahong, though that was no longer possible. But the Spanish, under the direction of Governor General de Lavezares used the occasion to send a delegation to China, to establish friendly relations and trade. Indeed, Beijing sent over an emissary in 1576, to conclude a commercial treaty, and immigration from the Middle Kingdom was encouraged as a source of skilled and cheap labor. While friendly relations with China ensured that the Iberians didn’t need to worry about threats from Beijing, Chinese immigration would periodically contribute to rising tensions between the Spanish settlers and the growing numbers of Chinese laborers and artisans. There were at tempts to restrict the in flux to no avail. In 1603, the Crown decreed that no more than 3,000 Sangleys (from the Chinese phrase for traders) be allowed to live in the colony, proposing that ships from China be sent back “full of people. In this way they can be removed and the country cleared of them, with more gentleness and kind treatment, as has already been done with many of them.” The tensions would sometimes lead to armed uprisings and the in evitable bloodbaths that followed. Governor Arandia in 1578 might have for eseen this when he at tempted to supplant the Chinese with mestizos and a larger in flux of Spanish. But Spain was too far, and China too near, for this to succeed. And the Chinese émigrés, with a presence then as now throughout Southeast Asia, had excellent survival as well as artisanal and trading skills to flourish in an environment that was to them far more conducive to growth than in China. By the end of the sixteenth century, more than 20,000 Chinese resided in the Parian district, just outside the walls of Intramuros, outnumbering the Spanish. The rapid growth of the Chinese immigrant community made the Spanish uneasy, and when a Chinese mission arrived in Manila in 1603, desirous of obtaining gold, the suspicions of the Spanish civil authorities were easily aroused. They in stituted precautionary measures that in turn in flamed the resident Chinese, who decided, under the leadership of Juan Bautista de Vera, a Chinese convert to Catholicism, to strike the first blow. Their assault on Intramuros was repulsed, however, and the rebels fled to the mountains of Laguna and Batangas, where they were defeated by the Spanish for ces—a combination of Spaniards, Filipinos, and even some Japanese. About 23,000 Chinese were killed as a result. There were other revolts by the Chinese, for in spite of restrictive measures against their immigration, their numbers in creased steadily. In 1639, in the town of Calamba, not far south of Manila, they took up arms against the local authorities and succeeded in destroying and plundering more than twenty to wns before the rebels were defeated. In 1662, following the example of Limahong almost a century earlier, Koxinga, a Chinese warlord who had conquered Formosa, threatened to in vade Manila unless the Spanish paid him tribute. The Spanish refused, to no consequence. The Chinese threat to the Spanish would be mainly from within, but the tensions would diminish as the Han immigrant communities set down roots even as they expanded. In addition to the Chinese, the Japanese also had small communities in the islands, for, as the Chinese, though not as numerous, the Japanese had been a presence even before the arrival of the Spaniards. There were Japanese communities in a neighborhood of Manila (present-day Paco) as well as in Bulacan, and in what was to become known as La Union, a coastal province up north. Salcedo had run-ins with Japanese ships off the coast of Pangasinan in 1572, and in 1583, a Spanish captain engaged the Japanese by the mouth of the Cagayan River.

Some Japanese Christians sought and were given asylum in Manila, among them some lords such as Takayama Ukon. S EVENTEENTH C ENTURY: S ETTLEMENTS T HROUGHOUT THE A RCHIPELAGO By the beginning of the seventeenth century, largely through the foundational and level-headed leadership of Legazpi, the sword arms of de Salcedo and Goiti, alliances with regional datus, and the missions established by hardy friars, the Spanish exercised sovereignty, even if only in rudimentary form, in Luzon (except for the mountainous regions up north and the eastern coast) and in much of the Visayas. By no means did this mean the disappearance of threats from with out or within. All throughout Spanish rule, such threats existed, from small- and large-scale revolts, for eign in vasions, harassment out at sea, and the ever- present threat from the Muslim south. The Protestant Dutch constituted the most serious threat to Spanish hegemony. Dutch warships threatened Manila and its surrounding settlements at least on three occasions, between 1600 and 1647, but each time were repulsed by the Spanish and their Filipino conscripts. Early on, there was some discussion as to whether it was worth keeping the islands. Legazpi, writing to the King in 1569, was convinced that the islands were worth holding onto, that “if the land is settled and peopled by Spaniards we shall be able to get plenty of gold, pearls, and other valuable articles…. [T]hus partly through commerce and partly through the articles of commerce, the settlers will in crease the wealth of the land in a short time.” Madrid finally decided to stay put, persuaded as well by the friars that the archipelago could be a base for missionary for ays to mainland Asia, and by its own ambition of extending its empire throughout the East. Indeed, from time to time, Spanish ships sailed out of the islands on exploratory expeditions or to do battle in defense of their colony. Until the eighteenth century, the Philippines served mainly as a military outpost, subsidized by grants from Nueva España, or Mexico, the galleon trade, and tribute from the in digenous population. The new colony was ruled by the Spanish king, of course, but through the viceroyalty of Mexico. The archipelago’s Governor and Captain General was to be the King’s representative in the islands, enforcer of the Patronato Real (Royal Patronage) and overseer of the King’s in terests. The Patronato Real was essentially a Crown policy that set rules for the presence and behavior of the Catholic Church in the colonies, guaranteeing that this would be under the supervision of the throne and of the particular colonial government. In effect, the clergy became part of the government, bringing about a union of church and state. As it turned out, this marriage proved to be more felicitous for the for mer than for the latter. As a reward for his success in driving away the in fidel Moors to wards the end of the fifteenth century, the Catholic King Ferdinand had asked for and received from the pope the right of patronato real over all churches to be established in the territory of the reconquista. This was exactly what the Crown wanted, and Ferdinand skillfully maneuvered the reafter to secure from the papacy extensions of his patronato to all his overseas dominions on the ground that evangelizing the heathen, or Indios, was the same as recovering Granada for Christendom. Evangelical work in the new territory thus came under royal supervision. Since the colony was to be administered from Mexico, Rome had no direct contact with the clergy in the new lands. The Spanish monarch also had veto power over the promulgation of papal bulls and exercised through his viceroys close supervision over ecclesiastics in his dominions. The Crown energetically used this prerogative, thus precipitating constant conflicts between, on one hand, Madrid and its servants, and, on the other, Rome and its men of the cloth. The Patronato Real was the primary in strument by which Spain could recruit the Church, as a complement to its rising commercial ventures. To speak of the Church in the Philippines during the Spanish regime was thus to speak of the Spanish clergy and the Spanish empire, each serving the ends of the other. Even though spreading Christianity and converting the natives to the faith was the primary justification for the Spanish presence, the king as patron of the Church in the Philippines had the authority to determine the limits of the mission territories and approve the assignment of missionaries. He also had the duty to protect them as well as provide for their support. In addition to being representatives of Rome, the friars were in effect salaried employees of the Spanish court. The supreme authority in the administration of the colonies would lie in the hands of the Council of the Indies, created by Ferdinand and reorganized by Charles in 1524. On behalf of the throne, the Council enacted laws and decrees to govern the colonies—the compilation of which came to be known as Leyes de Indias. As with other Spanish colonies, Las Islas Filipinas was to have the Real Audiencia, a legislative-judicial body.

In sum, this Asian colony was to be governed in a manner similar to Spain’s colonies in the Americas. Encomiendas and Tributes One mechanism by which control was exercised was through the encomienda. An encomienda was not a land grant, but rather a system—adapted in all the Spanish colonies—under which an encomendero (the term comes from the Spanish encomendar or “to entrust”) was charged with a number of natives living within a specific geographic area whom he was supposed to in struct in the Catholic faith and the Castilian to ngue. Natives living within the encomienda were deemed subject to Spanish sovereignty, with the encomendero taking on the role of petty king. He had the power to collect tribute, basically a tax, and to expect unpaid labor, or corvée, from the in habitants of the encomienda. The tribute furnished the revenue for such expenses as those of the missionaries imparting Christian doctrine and running the encomienda. It provided the encomendero and his family with their means of living. The encomienda was usually the reward for military men who had participated in the conquest and could be in herited for two, sometimes three, generations. After the limit had been reached, the land, or more accurately, control over it, reverted to the Crown. The movement of the natives was regulated to ensure a steady supply of labor and the systematic and prompt collection of the tribute. The encomendero was charged with ensuring the well-being of the Filipinos, a duty that in cluded a good Christian education. Unfortunately, the battle-tested encomenderos treated the natives more like delinquent military units than a community of human beings, abusing them by exacting both tribute and labor. The encomienda system also gave the encomenderos a pretext for seizing land from barangay in habitants. The system was finally abolished in 1720, though in the mid-nineteenth century, there still existed eleven encomiendas. The encomienda was an important tool in the early stages of Spanish colonization, rewarding those who had served the Spanish throne well. (Such was the case with Miguel de Loarca, an early chronicler of the Spanish conquest and member of the Legazpi expedition, given an encomienda on Panay island.) While the encomienda encompassed native settlements, it was not to be confused with a hacienda. The latter meant that ownership of the land resided with an in dividual, and those working the land were his tenants. He could dispose of the land freely, and his family in herited the land. In contrast, ownership of land within an encomienda remained with in dividuals and their families. Upon the death of a landowner, rights to the land passed on to his or her heirs. In the absence of heirs, ownership of the land passed to the barangay or town, which could then utilize that property to help pay for the town’s tributes. The encomenderos enjoyed their privileges fully but barely fulfilled their obligations. To them, Filipinos were little more than a resource to be exploited. Far from the administrative reach of Spain and even of Mexico, and with the colonial state apparatus stretched thinly, an encomendero was and usually did act like a petty tyrant. He in variably demanded that the Indios in his encomienda serve him and, if he didn’t get what he wanted, would punish them. According to the friar Martín de Rada’s account, “We have gone everywhere with the mailed hand; and we have required the people to be friends, and then to give us tribute. At times war has been declared against them, because they did not give as much as was demanded.” De Rada characterized the tribute demands as “excessive” and reported that the encomenderos “maintain stocks, in which they keep as prisoners the chiefs … who do not supply the amount of tribute.” Tribute was exacted from males between the ages of nineteen and sixty. Payment of tribute from slaves owned by the native nobility was required as well. If the slave was a sagigilid, then his or her master paid the tribute. A namamahay, on the other hand, living apart from the master, had to shoulder the tribute. (These conditions applied as well to the Spanish who did have slaves, though later they were for bidden to acquire them.) The encomendero kept a quarter of the tribute, a quarter, went to the friars, and the balance to the colonial government. In turn, the encomendero maintained peace and or der, helped the missionaries in their apostolic work and ensured the encomienda’s readiness to come to the defense of the colony, should this be required. In addition, the local population was obliged to render a certain amount of personal service to the Spanish, whether to the encomendero, the gobernadorcillo (“little governor” essentially the town mayor), or the parish priest. Men between the ages of sixteen and sixty were expected to donate their labor, known as polos y servicios, for forty days each year to so-called community projects. These services ranged from servant work and the supply of foodstuffs to shipbuilding and military service, which in turn could be anything from crewing on a warship to working in artillery units. The exaction of for ced labor—especially in the felling of trees and the building of ships—that continually disrupted livelihoods (such as working on one’s land), would be a constant irritant to the subject populace and perpetual in citement to rebellion. By the time of Legazpi’s death of a heart at tack in 1572, he had assigned 143 encomiendas to his men. Guido de Lavezares, his successor, not only assigned new encomiendas but reassigned those that fell vacant, thus disregarding explicit or ders that such vacancies revert to the Crown.

Once an encomienda did fall under the jurisdiction of the Crown, it was looked after by an alcalde mayor, who collected the tributes and answered only to Manila. Such were the abuses and cruel exactions from the encomenderos, and later from the various government of ficials who would take over their functions, that the local populations wound up impoverished and degraded—conditions they now had to endure regularly and so very different from the lives they had led prior to Spanish rule. In many in stances, the conditions approached those of slavery, leading friars to complain—though, as the friars the mselves grew to be very much a part of the colonial establishment, these diminished as their own abusive behavior in creased. By midseventeenth century, as more and more administrative positions were taken over by the civil government, the number of private encomiendas dwindled with the corresponding in crease in Crown lands. Keeping the Filipinos in Line Combining the exactions of tribute and physical labor with the imperative of gaining converts to the Catholic faith demanded a framework for control. In practical terms, this meant in tegrating the or iginal barangay into such a framework. Given how few the Spaniards were, and how much larger the native population, how was this to be accomplished? Part of the answer lay in resettlement, or reducción, wherein a large number of barangays lost their autonomy and were consolidated to form pueblos, the agglomeration of which, in turn, constituted the provinces of the new dispensation. In Spain’s South American colonies, resettlement was implemented jointly by church and state. In the Philippines friars shouldered the lion’s share of the burden. It was only natural that there would be opposition to the resettlement program, for it meant whole villages being uprooted from areas where they had their fields and lived for generations. A number of techniques were employed by the clergy, and by the civil authorities as well, to convince the reluctant native to move, such as gifts of housing within the reducciónes. Barangay chiefs were given titles and awarded honors. Too, the the at ricality of church rites—from the saying of Mass to the administering of the sacraments—seemed to have been another at traction. Otherwise, backed by soldiers, the friars resorted to threats. Quite of ten, aware of the power of the friars, in habitants of barangays would elect resettlement under the charge of the religious to secure protection from the oppression and cruelty of the encomenderos. Some sort of compromise allowed those still reluctant to move into the reducción itself to live in nearby areas, giving rise to the poblacíon (town) and barrio (outlying district) system which continues to this day. The church in each poblacíon symbolized the power of the colonial state as much as the municipio, or town hall, the seat of civil authority, and served as the focal point of the cultural and social life of the town. Similar to that of Intramuros, the layout of each pueblo centered on a town plaza, around which were situated the church-convent, the municipio, and la escuela or schoolhouse, embodying the hierarchy in colonial society. Naturally, the homes of the town’s more prominent citizens—members of the principalia, or power-holders—were located at or near the plaza, a nod to their importance. As go-betweens for both the colonizer and the native population, the principalia identified and were identified with those above them, their in creasing wealth creating a gap separating them from the rest of their countrymen and leading to a class structure more pronounced than in pre-colonial days. More of ten than not, these of ficials were drawn from the ranks of the pre-Hispanic elite—ensuring the survival of a significant portion of the old ruling class. It was lucrative for for mer datus to be believers not only in the faith of the church but in that of the Spanish state as well. The highest position open to the Filipino was that of gobernadorcillo, the equivalent of town mayor. He was the colonial state’s point man, as it were, collecting tributes and mobilizing labor for government projects. Any shortfall he had to shoulder, otherwise he could be fined or, worse, imprisoned. The advantage of course was that the system could be gamed so that the position provided the of ficial a steady and relatively easy means of making money. The new settlement pattern was partly determined by the notion that every resident live abajo de las campanas, “under the bells,” or within hearing distance of the church. Being able to hear the bells meant being able duly and faithfully to at tend mass, and respond to a call to arms should the need arise.

The clergy adapted by constructing chapels in the larger villages and making periodic visits to say mass and teach the catechism, which practice came to be known as visita. Native life under the colonial regime acquired a complexity not heretofore known. Each colonized Filipino was expected to live in a pueblo for purposes of civil government; be part of a doctrina, for religious in struction; and of an encomienda for the exaction of tribute, produce, and labor. T HE F RIARS AND THE C IVIL S TATE: W HO R EIGNED AND W HO R ULED? An on going debate, and at times open conflict, during the Spanish colonial period, was between the religious or ders and the civil administration. Underlying the debate was the question of who was truly sovereign in the archipelago, the Vatican or Madrid? It was clear from the Patronato Real that the Spanish monarch held sovereign sway over all matters pertaining to the conditions in the colony, be these in the secular or the spiritual realm, in cluding oversight of the appointment of religious personnel to the distant colony. On the ground, however, it was a far different story as to who held actual power, at least as far as the local populace was concerned. The distance from Madrid meant relatively few lay peninsular Spaniards made it to Southeast Asia. The peninsulares (as they were called) were augmented by Mexican Spaniards, but the aggregate still wasn’t sufficient. Hence, the religious did double duty, as spiritual and material administrators, wherever they had set up missions and, later, in parishes under their control. The subsequent in crease in prestige and material wealth of the friars led to power struggles with the colonial establishment. Invariably, the priests would claim the authority of the papacy to justify their position and resist the authority of the archbishop who nominally had jurisdiction over parishes. One of the early in stances of the two spheres conflicting was in the case of encomenderos, who were mostly ex-military men. As noted, the encomienda system was rife with abuse. The friars complained of such abuses—which in cluded the encomenderos’ with holding the friars’ fair share of the tributes—to the colonial government and to the King. The discord between the encomenderos and the friars was really about power: Who was to be the guardian over the lives of the encomienda’s in habitants, whose labor and property, after all, served as the source of both their revenues? But friar complaints were of ten seen as self-serving. In the late sixteenth century, one governor general, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, for example, felt the friars were using the alleged abuses to highlight what they believed to be their own superior qualifications. The not-so-hidden rifts between the civil and religious worlds could be traced to the question undergirding Spanish presence on the islands: What was the moral and legal basis of their sovereignty over the populace? The arguments propounded basically rested on the rationale that colonial presence was a mutually beneficial and legitimate compact between the Filipinos and the Spanish overlords. The Spanish king promised them even- handed administration, protection from their enemies, and religious education. It was as though in dividual pacts between the datus and the Spanish—the ones between Rajah Humabon and Magellan, and Sikatuna and Legazpi, being the prototypes—held true for all of the islands. In effect, the population was being asked to believe that their subjugation was really their liberation. In sum, Spanish colonial Philippines, though less than a perfect union of Church and State, could be “viewed either as a civilizing Church or a missionary State,” as the late, twentieth-century Filipino Jesuit historian Horacio de la Costa put it. With so many fresh souls to be harvested—one could say the colony for med a kind of spiritual Spice Islands for missionaries—priests were in demand for this faraway outpost of the Spanish empire. At the outset, those assigned to Las Islas Filipinas were experienced and genuinely committed to the spiritual goals of a missionary life. The first Bishop of Manila, the Dominican Domingo de Salazar, convened a council of clerics in 1582. Through his urging the council declared that sovereignty and adjudication “by natural right belong to the Indios and neither the King nor the Pope can take it away from them…. the Indios are as free in their lands as the Spaniards are in the irs, and their liberty is not taken away by the King or by the Gospel.” Such noble sentiments, being resolutely anti-colonial, were easily and subsequently disregarded, as the trappings of power came to fit the friar as comfortably as they did the civilian administrator. The economic and social privileges granted to them by the king gradually resulted in the lowering of standards, in tellectually and morally. The very real possibility of getting materially rich made priesthood in the Philippines a lucrative proposition; God’s calling the cover under which Mamon could be served eagerly and faithfully. The early years of hardship and asceticism gave way to pampered living. Thus, for in stance, by 1698, the Manila archbishop, on his visitation to certain parishes in Laguna, where friars acted as parish priests, had to for bid the exaction of fees from the parishioners for the performance of the sacraments. Charging a fee to hear a confession was not uncommon (anticipating, perhaps, the fees charged by modern-day psychiatrists). For Holy Communion to be administered to the dying, in stead of the priest making a house call, the family was obliged to carry the in dividual to the church. Otherwise the family would have to pay a fee. In his book The Roots of the Filipino Nation, Onofre D. Corpuz remarks that “this had been the practice of the Spanish friars and curates since the early days of Hispanic Christianity in Filipinas"

Corpuz remarks that “this had been the practice of the Spanish friars and curates since the early days of Hispanic Christianity in Filipinas. Previous or ders prohibiting this practice … were ignored.” Exorbitant fees effectively made the poor even poorer. In addition, the friars charged parishioners for supplying them with religious items such as rosaries and required them to provide both personal services and food—of ten, with a surplus that the good friar could then sell for profit. Nor was concubinage uncommon, leading to the popular albeit exaggerated observation that most Filipinos to day have some friar blood in their veins. Geographical distance and consequent isolation rendered consistent supervision difficult. And relying on the friars for administrative tasks, normally the province of civil servants, frequently resulted in their spiritual calling too of ten taking a back seat. There were friars who stuck to their spiritual calling, of course, but absolute power corrupts absolutely. With their economic power, in dispensable role in civil administration, and spiritual authority of ten wielded with the threat of excommunication, the friars succeeded in marrying their avowedly spiritual goals to the less pristine pursuit of material gain—with the latter assuming a more prominent role than would be seemly for the demands of a spiritual life. In this the friar was aided by the principalia, who had vested in terests in the status quo; the in roads Catholicism had made into in digenous culture; and the availability of armed force should the Indios prove to be too restless under the strict rod. This unusual combination of power and prerogative made the friar the principal figure in each community and the Church the de facto dominant in stitution in the country. A major reason for the ensuing corruption of the friars was land, now a commodity subjected to in dividual ownership, a concept the Spanish had in troduced to the islands. Being in charge of parishes (normally reserved for the secular clergy, or diocesan priests who did not, unlike the friar, belong to any religious or der and were the refore under the direct supervision of the diocesan bishop), the friar or ders could own lands for their support. In time, the clergy replaced the encomenderos, whose arbitrary and exploitative practices they used to denounce. How did the men of the cloth acquire lands? By royal bequest; donations; in heritances from the pious desirous, no doubt, of assuring the mselves a place in heaven; through the outright purchase of property from the locals with the money the friars had gained from church fees, from trade, or from the produce of lands earned through for ced labor; and from for eclosures, the tenant farmer unable to pay the money he had borrowed, most likely from the friars the mselves, and thus for ced to give up the land he had pledged as collateral. The principalia, agents of the Spanish colonial apparatus, also took advantage of the privatization of property, disregarding the tradition of communally held land. Land was previously seen principally as a source of food for consumption and barter and not an in dex of wealth. The principalia were able to acquire in dividual and legal titles to land, with the resident tillers now as tenant farmers —a new and disempowering status. During the seventeenth century the process of transferring more land to fewer people grew apace, so that by 1800 the provincial hierarchy, heavily dependent on agriculture, was made up of the estate-owning friar or ders, the land-owning principalia, and the local populace— the latter consisting mainly of tenant farmers and agricultural laborers. Those working the friar lands—whether simple tenant farmers or in quilinos, natives who had the means to sublet their leases to tenant farmers—had no recourse when their rents were raised almost every year. When accepting rent in kind, the friars determined the value of the goods, naturally below market rates, since they were powerful enough to fix the prices at which produce was to be bought and sold. Aside from their in vestments in land, the or ders were actively engaged in the commercial life of the country. Through benevolent associations known as obras pias, which in effect acted like commercial banks, they in vested in various commercial enterprises. Parishes were thus run like the colonial state that engulfed it: a seemingly endless source of profit that could be justified, and was, by the earthly demands of their, the friars’, spiritual mission. Building the road to heaven didn’t, after all, come cheap. Since pacification rested mainly on the in digenous embrace of Catholicism, the religious played an in or dinate role in maintaining Spanish power in most communities. Moreover, in so many of the barangays, no other Spaniard existed but the good friar, the only symbol of colonial authority. Governors of ten complained of clerical abuses and appealed to Madrid to keep the clerics in line. A number of them took steps to curb the clerics’ power but their efforts were for the most part successfully rebuffed. Perhaps the most extreme reaction to an activist governor was in 1719, when Governor General Fernando Bustamante—a military commander of high rank and the first such to be appointed governor general of the Philippines—was slain by a mob led by friars, who stormed the palace, overpowered the guard, and knifed the governor and his son to death. The governor had apparently found out that the friars had borrowed heavily from the government and from the obras pias. Bustamante demanded repayment of the loans and, to assert his authority, had the archbishop imprisoned on charges of having conspired against the government"

Bustamante demanded repayment of the loans and, to assert his authority, had the archbishop imprisoned on charges of having conspired against the government. In another, earlier clash between the civil and religious spheres that ended bizarrely, Governor General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, Spanish governor of the Philippines from 1635-1644, exiled Archbishop Hernando Guerrero to Mariveles, a remote town across the bay. The cause for this humiliation? The prelate, along with most of the clergy, was enraged when the governor had a Spanish artilleryman by the name of Francisco de Nava dragged out of the San Augustin Church in Intramuros even though he had claimed sanctuary. Nava had knifed his female ex-slave to death in front of the church for refusing to marry him. He was tried, found guilty of murder, and hanged at the gallows erected right across from the church. To the clergy, particularly the Augustinians, this was a brazen in sult. The archbishop had religious rites and services suspended. Once Hurtado stepped down, the clergy (except for the Jesuits, who thought Hurtado had justifiable cause to ignore the right of sanctuary) in sisted he be brought to court and punished. And so he was, found guilty and imprisoned for five years before finally being freed by royal or der. It is said that as part of his sentence he was compelled to stand at the doors of churches, clad in the drab at tire of a penitent, holding a lighted taper and a rope around his neck. It wasn’t as though the civil authorities the mselves were models of democratic behavior and restraint. They were no less exploitative. For in stance, the Guardia Civil, the nineteenth-century successor to local militias and essentially a police force found in major to wns and villages, was much feared by the local populace for their of ten arbitrary and abusive behavior, as were petty town of ficials. In effect, extracting the most profit out of the colony turned into a fierce albeit unofficial competition between two rival spheres. D EVELOPMENT OF THE I SLAND E CONOMY Galleon Trade The galleon trade, the foundations for which had been laid by Andrés de Urdaneta’s successful return voyage to Mexico in 1565, in volved the highly profitable shipment of goods from Manila—goods that for the most part came from China—to Acapulco. The voyage from Manila took four months, with the ships in cluding in their cargo spices, ivory, porcelain, lacquerware, and processed silk. The goods were then transshipped overland to Veracruz, where they were loaded onto ships bound for Spain. Payment was in Mexican silver, so the galleon returning from Acapulco would be laden with the highly prized metal, along with provisions and passengers bound for the islands, providing a tempting target for privateers roaming the Pacific. This trade was monopolized by Spaniards in Manila—and even then, only a select group that in cluded the governor general, members of the Royal Audiencia, and the religious or ders. Mexican silver helped sustain the colonial enterprise and was highly valued in China. Very little Philippine produce or products were shipped out, hence the galleon trade did little to spur domestic manufacture. Precisely because the galleon trade was profitable, the Spanish colonists paid scant at tention to developing either the agricultural or manufacturing in dustry. The lucrative Manila-Acapulco run led merchants in Spain, particularly in Cádiz and Sevilla, to petition the Crown to limit the number of ships that could ply the trade route. Hence, starting in 1593, only two ships a year were permitted to sail between Manila and Acapulco. Exports from Manila were limited to P 250,000 * worth of goods (later in creased to P 500,000). Mexican goods brought back were not supposed to exceed double the value of the exports. The profits from the galleon trade made Manila a prosperous city, evident in the construction of solid buildings and outer walls and the availability of luxury goods for those who could afford them. By 1650 the population of the Walled City and its surroundings was approximately 42,000. Most of the Spaniards in the islands were concentrated in Intramuros, while a thriving Chinese community occupied the Parian district, which lay just outside the city walls. As an in dication of continuing Spanish distrust of the Chinese, on the thick walls of Intramuros facing the Parian were cannon trained on the district, in case its residents suddenly got restless. But the galleons carried more than goods, bringing letters and decrees to and from Spain and Mexico, as well as new species of crops, such as maize, avocado, to mato, cacao, and sweet potato. (The word for the latter is kamote in Tagalog, camotli in Nahuatl.) And of course human cargo: of ficials, clerics, soldiers, etc. Inevitably, these commercial and administrative links between Mexico and Las Islas Filipinas had a cultural impact. A tangible symbol of those days and one of the most venerated icons in Philippine Christianity is the Black Nazarene, ensconced in a shrine at Quiapo Church in the heart of Manila. Carved by a Mexican craftsman and brought to the colony during the seventeenth century, the Nazarene is the object of daily veneration by countless worshippers, an adoration that reaches its climax every January 9, when it is paraded through the surrounding districts, pulled by men and only by men, amidst sweaty, swaying throngs of believers who at tempt to wipe their handkerchiefs on the icon in the hopes that its miraculous power will somehow be transmitted. The trade between Mexico and the Philippines meant small colonies of Filipinos taking up residence in the New World, and likewise, Mexicans staying on in the Philippines"

The trade between Mexico and the Philippines meant small colonies of Filipinos taking up residence in the New World, and likewise, Mexicans staying on in the Philippines. Probably the earliest settlement of Filipinos in the New World was made up of crew members who jumped ship when the galleons docked at Acapulco, the earliest know in stance being in 1618, when seventy- four Filipinos stayed on. Filipino sailors were to settle elsewhere in the Mexican state of Guerrero and even in the bayous near New Orleans. These Louisiana Filipino expatriates were the reafter referred to as the Manilamen. The earliest recorded settlement in the United States was circa 1850, when St. Malo, a small fishing and shrimping village of Filipinos, as well some Chinese and Native Americans, grew on the outskirts of New Orleans. (In 1883 the Anglo-Greek immigrant Lafcadio Hearn wrote a feature on the village for Harper’s Weekly, and described its in habitants as a “swarthy population of Orientals—Malay fishermen who speak the Spanish creole of the Philippines as well as their own Tagal and perpetuate in Louisiana the Catholic traditions of the Indies.” In 1890 Hearn moved to Japan as a correspondent. There he married, took on the Japanese name of Koizumi Yakumo, and acquired a reputation as a popularizer of traditional Japanese culture.) Essential to the way the island economy took shape were the Chinese, already living, as we have seen, in the archipelago, albeit in small numbers, when the Spanish arrived. Their numbers grew, however, once the Spanish had settled in and exerted control over the islands. The presence of the Europeans and the galleon trade meant an expansion of commerce—with Manila as the transshipping port—and the acquisition of the much-valued Mexican silver. Spanish presence also meant the demand for the services of Chinese artisans. Gradually, the in flux of traders and artisans, mostly from the southern coastal provinces like Fujian, Amoy, and Guangdong, caused the resident communities of Chinese to expand. Relying on the profitable galleon trade and the prerogatives of colonial government (especially the polos y servicios) to lead privileged and of ten luxurious lives, the Spanish left the retail trade and the crafts to the Chinese who came to dominate both. Thus was laid the foundation by which the Chinese assumed a prominence, if not dominance, in the economy that continues to the present. Soon ubiquitous in the rural areas, the Chinese merchants acted as in termediaries between the cash system and the product-or iented native economy. And so Chinese retailers and tradesmen had an enormous impact on the colony’s economic life, distributing Chinese goods to Philippine villages and selling local products to the Spaniards. In this way, too, the Chinese dispersed through the archipelago, to as far south as Muslim Jolo, seat of the Sulu Sultanate. Consequently, the Philippine economy developed three distinct tiers: that of the Spanish, that of the Chinese, and that of the natives—corresponding to the existence of three distinct cultural communities. Intermarriage did occur frequently between the Chinese and the locals, so that by the late eighteenth century, enough Chinese mestizos existed as to be classified separately by the government. (In addition, to ease the suspicions of the Spanish, many Chinese converted to Catholicism.) The existence of these distinct economies would in variably be affected by the country gradually opening up to global markets, especially by the middle of the eighteenth century (a globalization that moved along on cultural and political axes as well as economic ones). Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, and with an in for mal network already in place, the Chinese more than the colonizing Spanish assumed a larger and more vital role in the economic development of the country, the Chinese being the middleman, buyer, and of ten the supplier in the numerous to wns and villages upended the pre-conquest economic patterns of the Filipinos. Especially in the retail trade, the Chinese rose to preeminent positions. For all that, government regulations were antiquated, the product of a vanished era. Some at tempts at the close of the eighteenth century were made to in stitute far-reaching economic reforms that would have helped the colony metamorphose into more than just an outpost of a declining empire and source of raw materials. By then, the colony’s population stood at a million and a half, with the bishoprics of Manila and Cebu consisting each of 500,000 in habitants.

The company aimed to regulate commerce between the mother country, Spain, and Asia, by way of the Cape of Good Hope, and to bring goods directly from China to Manila, with out being bound by the schedule of Chinese junks. The company also hoped to spur domestic manufacturing through the exploitation of natural resources. An at tempt to compete with textiles from Bengal and Coromandel, however, resulted in heavy losses. And by 1790, the company had yet to establish trade relations directly with India, China, or Japan, relying as before on middlemen in Manila. As much as an agent of change that it may have been, the Company’s privileges were revoked, and by 1834 the agency was abolished. It had proven to be a complete failure, crippled by consistently bad management and excessive speculation. The colonial government declared Manila to be a free and open port in 1789 for a limited time and made permanent in 1805. In 1796, the first American merchant ship docked in Manila. By 1814, Manila had a vibrant community of for eign merchants. (In the Visayas, the ports of Iloilo and Cebu were declared open to for eign trade in 1855 and 1865 respectively, resulting in the local economies expanding and a corresponding in crease in the ranks of the petit bourgeoisie.) Even so, the for eign merchants could only trade in Asian goods and were not allowed to participate in the trade between the colony and Spain. Easily circumvented, these restrictions were gradually lifted. With that, more than two centuries of isolation ended. This opening up to the West, for it was the West that most avidly desired it, took place more or less at the same time other Asian ports were opening up: in China, Japan, and Siam (present-day Thailand). The opening up of Manila meant that the once-sleepy port was now booming. Trading ships from Europe and North America made regular calls. The city’s population grew to approximately 150,000 by the middle of the nineteenth century. Migrants from nearby provinces flocked to the city for jobs as well as for higher education and cultural enrichment—the typical lures of any developing urban center. It accelerated the opening of the rest of the country while for eign in vestment and capital stimulated the local agriculture in dustry. This was especially true in the sugar, abaca, and copra in dustries. Technological improvements, the rising demand for these products in in ternational markets, and the subsidies provided by for eign traders and importers led to dramatic in creases in yields for these crops. They had become prime commodities globally, though naturally subject to the vagaries of the marketplace. Sugar was a prime illustration. Until the mid-nineteenth century, sugar was a bit player in the Philippine economy. But with Iloilo as an open port in 1855, the sugar in dustry took off on Negros Island, across Guimaras Straits, its soil perfect for sugar cultivation. The island population in creased dramatically, from 30,000 in 1850 to 320,000 by 1893, as land was cleared for sugar plantations and to wns were built and in frastructure put into place. The in troduction of steam-powered mills in 1860 by British merchants, much more entrepreneurial than the Spanish, caused a 600-fold in crease in output, from 200 tons in 1850 to 120,000 tons in 1893. Similar in creases in sugar production took place in Central Luzon as well. By the close of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, sugar constituted a major source of export earnings. The abundance of sugar meant the production of rum, of which sugar is the most important raw material. In 1860, a trading partnership and steamship company founded a few years earlier by a Spanish family, the Elizaldes, built the Tanduay distillery in Manila that to this day produces its signature rum. But while sugar provided the sweet life for a few landed families, it in turn caused dislocation and bitter misery for peasants deprived of their land. The late nineteenth-century agrarian upheaval caused by large-scale azucareras (sugar refineries) created a class of seasonal farm laborers called sacadas, who migrated to different plantations during the harvest season to work for abysmal wages while enduring degrading living conditions. (In the twenty-first century, not much has changed. The sacada is still there and so is the exploitation.) The liberalization of trade resulted in a relatively more diverse financial system. Up to then, local businessmen and farmers were subject to usurious loans, complicated by the fact that the domestic financial in stitutions were usually beholden to the friar or ders. With for eign trading companies and their financial backers on the scene, local entrepreneurs could turn to them for less on erous terms. The first bank founded by a Filipino was the Rodriguez Bank, circa 1831. Francisco Rodriguez was quite a wealthy man living in Manila when in 1823 he was wrongly accused of being in volved in a local conspiracy spearheaded by three Mexican-born Spanish army of ficers in the islands. These of ficers were accused of harboring rebellious motives, due both to Mexico’s new status as an in dependent nation and the fact that the newly appointed governor of the archipelago, Juan Antonio Martínez (1822-1825), had in 1822 brought with him several of ficers from the continent whom he favored, by passing the more senior of ficers already in the colony, among them the three conspirators. The conspiracy was found out, two of ficers were deported, and the third, Andrés Novales, was reassigned to Mindanao. After a short time, however, Novales rallied 800 disgruntled soldiers to his side and led a mutiny, which was quickly put down and Novales executed. The Novales Mutiny as it was termed was the first at tempted coup d’etat during Spanish colonial rule in the islands, although one that sprung from narrow grievances rather than any newfound sense of nationalism"

The Novales Mutiny as it was termed was the first at tempted coup d’etat during Spanish colonial rule in the islands, although one that sprung from narrow grievances rather than any newfound sense of nationalism. Implicated in the Novales affair along with several other civilians, Rodriguez was sent to Cádiz in 1825 as a political prisoner. He managed to escape and fled to London, from where he waged an unsuccessful campaign to convince his friends and relatives to plead his in nocence before the civil authorities in Manila. Unable to gain access to his riches, he became destitute and undoubtedly would have died penniless and heartbroken had he not been taken in and cared for by Quakers in London, with whom he lived for five years. Not surprisingly, Rodriguez became a Quaker as well as a British subject. By then, the Spanish government pardoned all those in volved in the uprising. Rodriguez returned to Manila, where he established the Rodriguez Bank, to assist for eign traders, primarily American and British, in their dealings with Filipinos and in direct competition with Spanish financiers. Mindful of the difference between how he had been treated by the Spanish and the British, Rodriguez wore his Quaker outfit much to the delight of the children on the streets who ran after and jeered him, and the consternation of for mer friends, relatives, and especially the local friars. The religious establishment tried to have him expelled, but his British citizenship afforded him the protection he needed. Upon his death, he bequeathed his for tune to the Queen of England, for the benefit of the widows and or phans of British soldiers killed in the Crimean War. His relatives challenged the legitimacy of the will and in itially won their suit. On appeal by the British government, however, the Supreme Court in Madrid reversed the decision by the lower court. The bank was shut down, and Rodriguez’s for tune was eventually paid out to the British. The Quaker had had his revenge. Other financial in stitutions that arose were the Obras Pias and the Banco Español-Filipino. In 1841, all but four confraternities—with their or igins in the late sixteenth century, run by the religious or ders and meant to extend financial assistance to Spaniards—were dissolved, presumably to in crease their efficiency in light of the lower in terest rates of fered by for eign bankers, trading in terests who were only too willing to extend loans to local farmers. The latter had been customarily denied recourse to funds reserved for the Spanish or would be charged usurious rates by the friars. In a pattern that remains to this day, tenant farmers on the huge landed estates of the friar or ders borrowed money at exorbitant rates in or der to work the land and harvest the crops. It was a system almost guaranteed to keep a tenant farmer perpetually in debt, as market prices for their crops were in variably controlled either by middlemen who had ties to the friar or ders, or by the friars the mselves. The for eign merchants provided an alternative which native entrepreneurs eagerly took advantage of. The remaining four confraternities were or dered by Governor General Antonio de Urbiztondo (1850-1853) to amalgamate in 1851 and become Obras Pias. The next year Governor Urbiztondo authorized the founding of the Banco Español-Filipino, which handled the more lucrative aspects of banking, in cluding the right to issue bank notes—previously, Mexican currency had been used—the reby becoming the de facto government bank of the colony. Realizing that favoring Spanish merchants over Filipinos deprived them of a potentially larger market, Banco Español-Filipino adopted the more liberal practices of its for eign competitors. In 1912, in keeping with the new colonial dispensation, the bank renamed itself as the Bank of the Philippine Islands, a venerable in stitution that continues to this day. Despite its awareness of the need to keep up with modern business and trading practices, the government in Manila dragged its feet in in stituting needed reforms. Partly in response to pressure applied by traders, a Tribunal of Commerce was established in 1834, later transformed in 1835 into the Chamber of Commerce, which was charged with impartially adjudicating disputes within the business community. But like other colonial in stitutions, it was just as susceptible to in fluence peddling as any other agency, and rarely accomplished anything worthy of note. Such bureaucratic hurdles discouraged for eign traders from in vesting in the Philippines, with many lured to trade in China, which, mainly controlled by the British, had more liberal laws. With a decline in trade, the Manila government turned to Sinibaldo de Mas, an adventurer, poet, and the person believed to have in troduced photography to the Philippines—he had brought the first daguerreotype camera to the islands. Charged with studying business conditions within the islands, de Mas came out with his Informe Sobre el Estado de las Filipinas en 1842 ( On the Conditions of the Philippines in 1842 ). Clearly against a protectionist policy he advocated that ports in addition to Manila should be opened, the to bacco monopoly be terminated, and immigration should be encouraged. He compared the Philippines with another Spanish colony, Cuba, and demonstrated convincingly how that Caribbean island, with a smaller population, had trade contracts worth $27 million, while the Philippines, with four times more in habitants and a bigger physical and agricultural base, only took in about $5 million annually.

When the reforms he had suggested were adopted and began to take effect, trade improved, with the Americans and the British becoming preeminent. N ATIVE R ESISTANCE: M ERCENARIES, C ONSCRIPTS, AND R EBELS The Filipinos as colonial subjects bore most of the burden of a rule that the or etically was meant to benefit them. They were thus on the frontlines, whether on expeditionary trips to Borneo and the Moluccas, or fighting the Dutch and the English on the high seas, or providing most of the labor on the galleons that plied the Manila-Acapulco route. In the early seventeenth century the Christianized Filipinos fought their non-Christian brothers in campaigns against Mindanao and Jolo, as well as putting down, of ten savagely, Chinese uprisings. The earliest revolt came shortly after the Spanish had made Manila the seat of their still-shaky state, at a time when Limahong was threatening to destroy the city. As described earlier, Rajahs Lakandula and Suleiman (rulers respectively of Tondo and Maynila) felt their prerogatives had been slighted by the Spanish, but De Salcedo appeased them enough so that the two rulers added their for ces to the corps of Manila’s defenders. Limahong was thus defeated. The imposition of colonial rule was rarely, if ever, smooth, with the in digenous populations in many communities resisting the curtailment of their traditional customs and liberties. Additionally, the obligation to pay tribute and render personal services—wartime duty, the building of ships, etc.—seriously limited their efforts to earn a living, necessary in the first place to pay the tribute, creating a vicious circle that seemed impossible to break. In the main, the locals were seen as another natural resource to be exploited, whether this was to in crease the tally of souls saved, which the in dustrious friars kept tabs on, or to provide for a Spaniard’s living. (The understandable reluctance of the in digenous folk to fulfill the demands of corvée would engender stereotypical portrayals of the Filipino as being naturally in dolent—another reason advanced for the upliftment provided by colonial rule.) Abolition of the tribute and corvée were the main demands echoed by almost all uprisings throughout Spanish colonization. From 1574 to the close of the seventeenth century, the Spanish colonial state had to put out fires of varying in tensity, while dealing with external threats from rival European powers. Between 1574 and 1661, there were at least eight significant revolts. We have noted resistance of fered by Suleiman and Lakandula. A decade later, in 1584, Agustin de Legazpi, a Christianized prominent citizen of Tondo, the ancient town that abutted Manila, or ganized a clandestine separatist movement—the first in stance in the Spanish colonial period, and for erunner of the revolutionary movement that would erupt three hundred years later. Even with arms smuggled in by a sympathetic Japanese sea captain, the conspiracy was foiled, and de Legazpi and seven others were executed, in cluding Magat Salamat, datu of Tondo. Fifteen others were deported to Mexico. Uprisings occurred in various regions of the islands, in dicating widespread dissatisfaction with Spanish colonial rule. Simultaneous though uncoordinated revolts by Bankaw in Leyte and Tamblot in Bohol in 1621 were to protest the imposition of a new faith, each leader wanting a restoration of traditional beliefs and practices. The very fact of their non-Christian appellations in dicated either a refusal to be baptized or a discarding of their baptismal names. From 1649 to 1661, failed uprisings occurred in Samar, Pangasinan, Pampanga, and the Ilocos region. With no alliances beyond the particular barangay in volved, these revolts were easily and bloodily suppressed. During the first half of the seventeenth century, wars against the Dutch and military expeditions against the Muslims in the south strained the material and human resources of the Spanish colonists. As a result, abuses on the part of colonial of ficials, if not condoned, were overlooked for pragmatic reasons. In turn, such abuses generated resistance that took various forms depending on how or ganized a settlement was. Dagohoy’s Republic The longest uprising during the Spanish colonial period took place on Bohol and was led by a cabeza de barangay, or barangay chief, Francisco Dagohoy. From 1744 to 1829—an astounding eighty-four years—Dagohoy and his followers numbering in the thousands lived in self-sufficient farming communities they had built in the mountainous in terior of the island, for all in tents and purposes declaring in dependence from Spanish sovereignty. By all accounts an upstanding citizen who had until 1744 recognized the authority of both the church and the state, Dagohoy was in censed when the Jesuit curate of the town of Inabanga, Fr. Gaspar Morales, refused Dagohoy’s brother, Sagarino, a Catholic burial. Sagarino, working for the town as a policeman, had been killed in an encounter with a fugitive, a for mer Christian turned apostate—a crime in those days. The Jesuit’s reason for denying Sagarino a Christian burial was that his death had been occasioned by a duel, which the church for bade. Understandably this refusal didn’t sit well with Dagohoy, who, sworn to revenge, killed Fr. Morales. Another Jesuit curate in a nearby town was killed as well. Dagohoy led three thousand Boholanos to quit their pueblos and join him in setting up communities in the mountains. Dagohoy’s following swelled to as many as twenty thousand over the years. Clearly, refusal of a Christian burial to his brother was the last straw, and emblematic of longer held grievances, the main one being the dreaded corvée. The charismatic Dagohoy would not have had such a large following had the rebels not already harbored their own festering resentments"

The charismatic Dagohoy would not have had such a large following had the rebels not already harbored their own festering resentments. While Dagohoy and his followers observed the rites of Catholicism, such as baptism, and remained steadfast Catholics—though apparently with out the services of or dained curates—they also emphasized the traditions of bayanihan, the reby eliminating tribute and for ced labor. Best of all, the oppressive representatives and symbols of Spanish rule—the ubiquitous padre, the local militia, and the petty town of ficials—were absent. Life was so much better now for Dagohoy and his followers. In effect, they had become what the Spanish termed remontados —literally, “those who remount,” i. e., take to their horses and leave the Spanish-controlled barangays, or people who had chosen to live outside the jurisdiction of the colonial state. Hampering the Spanish authorities’ campaign to subdue the rebels were the well-entrenched positions and for tifications the latter had erected in their mountain lairs. Additionally, sympathizers provided them both supplies and in for mation regarding possible Spanish at tacks. In the meantime, the Seven Years’ War (1756 to 1763) had broken out in Europe. A global conflict that in volved not only Europe but the New World (where it was known as the French and Indian War), Asia, and Africa, it was a battle between two colonial powers, France and England, with France losing most of its North American possessions as a consequence. With the Bourbon- descended Charles III of Spain allied with France, in 1759, a British military expedition or ganized by the British East India Company sailed to Manila from India. The in vasion took the defenders of Intramuros completely by surprise, leading to an easy takeover in late 1762. Having to or ganize resistance outside of Manila, especially in northern Luzon, the Spanish and Filipino loyalist for ces led by Simón de Anda, had their hands full. Dagohoy could wait. By then, Britain was in the vanguard of the in dustrial revolution, its far-flung empire grown muscular and a source of tremendous wealth. The Bourbon- controlled Spanish empire, in contrast, was flaccid, in decline, and its speedy defeat by the British symbolized the latter’s ascendant hegemony. After the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, the British with drew, and the Spanish flag flew once more over Intramuros. Unsuccess ful at tempts were made either to negotiate with or to subdue Dagohoy and his followers. In 1827, a force of 2,200 native and Spanish troops was sent against them, and again in 1828, but these campaigns failed. But by August 31, 1829, the Spanish had crushed the rebellion, taking a year of repeated assaults to do so. By then, Dagohoy had been dead, though no record survives of when and how he died. Three thousand Boholanos’s escaped to other islands, 395 died in battle, 19,420 surrendered, and 98 were exiled. Only in Muslim Mindanao was resistance to Spanish rule longer than the Boholanos’ eighty-five years, a rebellion that lasted through the tenure of twenty Spanish governors general. The Silang Revolt In northern Luzon, the local populations in Pangasinan and Ilocos took advantage of the turmoil brought about by the British in vasion to advocate violently for reforms and try to shake off Spanish repression. The Pangasinan revolt began in late 1762 and was headed by Juan de la Cruz Palaris. It was put down in March of 1764, and its principal leaders executed. The more notable uprising was north of Pangasinan, in the Ilocos region, at that time made up of La Union, Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte. The revolt was headed by thirty- two-year-old Diego Silang, a member of the principalia, who, or phaned at an early age, had been brought up by a parish priest in Vigan. He married a well-to- do widow and happened to be in Manila awaiting the arrival of a galleon from Mexico when the British occupied the city. With the British takeover shattering the myth of Spanish in vincibility, and encouraged by the uprising in Pangasinan—though no effort seemed to have been made to wards joining for ces—Silang and aggrieved Ilocanos demanded the elimination of the polos y servicios, and the expulsion of Spanish mestizos. A mini-civil war erupted between those agitating for reforms and those loyal to the Spanish. Silang gained the upper hand in the southern part of the region. Prior to this revolt, Silang had already been in the vanguard of protesting, in Vigan, against the abuses of the governor (the alcalde mayor ) and demanding the dismissal of some local of ficials. His demands, unacceptable though they were to the Spaniards, were nevertheless reformist rather than radical. Seeking the protection of the British as well as to trade with them, Silang sent communiqués to the British in Manila, and the latter responded by appointing him Sargente Mayor, Alcalde Mayor, and Captain in the War for his British Majesty. Though it was doubtful the British meant more than to flatter Silang, the latter, who seemed to have messianic tendencies, would have welcomed such titles. He declared Christ to be the Captain General, with him as second-in-command. Making Vigan his capital, he abolished tribute and for ced labor, expelled the Spanish, and confiscated the wealth of the church. But Silang’s triumph was momentary. With the encouragement and blessing of both the local bishop and the Manila ecclesiastical authorities, Silang was assassinated by a Spanish mestizo, Miguel Vicos. Silang’s widow, Gabriela, along with his uncle, Nicolas Cariño, took over, seeking refuge in the mountains and directing the uprising for another four months. But the northern region remained loyal and, with reinforcements from the outside, defeated the anti- Spanish for ces. In late 1763, Gabriela and ninety others were captured and hanged"

Resistance in Religious Garb Four years after the departure of the Redcoats, the Jesuits were expelled by royal decree in 1768, for cing them to abandon 114 missions and some schools. The Jesuits had arrived in the Philippines in 1581 and were assigned the Diocese of Cebu, which encompassed parts of northwestern Mindanao. They also took over a seminary in Manila, which became the Colegio de San José, the first college in the islands. (Twenty years later, in 1611, the Dominicans founded present-day University of Santo Tomás, the Catholic University of the Philippines, an in stitution older than Harvard, which was founded in 1636.) Their expulsion came about because the monarchical governments in France, Portugal, and Spain had grown wary of the Jesuits’ education of the colonized, which was in terpreted as empowering them, and the refore undermining colonial rule. The Archbishop of Manila at the time, Sancho Santa Justa, had or dained Filipino seminarians assigned to these parishes, speeding along the Filipinization of the clergy—an unwelcome development as far as the Spanish friars were concerned. At the same time, the friars were opposed to or exceedingly reluctant to grant diocesan visitations, the normal prerogative of the archdiocesan bishop when it came to secular clergy. Since the or ders already had their own superiors, the friars resented this additional layer of authority. Besides, it could lead to a further secularization of the parishes—and a diminution of friar power. In the Philippines, this was more significantly a racial matter, since the friars were peninsulares, or clergy born in Spain, while the secular clergy were in sulares, or Philippine-born priests. By rejecting the right of visitation, the friars were in directly repudiating royal oversight, as it was the Crown that determined appointments to bishoprics, and the bishops determined who staffed the parishes. Both issues—the appointment of native clerics to parishes and regulatory power from outside their friar estates—highlighted how these religious groups jealously guarded their hard-earned (and highly lucrative) preeminent role in the everyday lives of the Filipinos. Theoretically subordinate to the Crown, the friar estates in fact of ten held more power than the colonial regime. By the late eighteenth century it was all but impossible to remove Spanish friars as parish priests. In 1804 they came under the jurisdiction of a vicar-general based, not in Rome, but in Spain—adding another layer of in sulation from the civil government and from the local diocesan bishop. The Jesuits were allowed back in 1859, as authorized by a decree of Queen Isabella II. Re-accommodating them created a domino effect. The Recollects, who had replaced the Jesuits or iginally, asked the government for parishes in Cavite, across the bay from Manila. They as well as the Dominicans were assigned parishes in 1862, at the expense of native-born clergy who held these aforementioned posts. In this manner, Antipolo, a site of pilgrimage and one of the richest parishes in the country, was taken out of the hands of the in sulares and entrusted to the peninsulares. The native clergy rightly saw this as a government strategy to severely circumscribe their role. By then, the only colonies remaining in the once-great Spanish Empire were Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas. Given that Mexican creoles of Filipino descent had fought in the populist army headed by a priest, Fr. Miguel Hildalgo, who launched the war of in dependence against Spain in 1810, the colonial authorities were determined that the virus of nationalism would not be spread by sympathetic native priests. In fact, just before the British in vaded the islands in 1762, there had been a Manila-born secular priest, Don Miguel Lino de Ezpeleta, who, having become the Arch bishop of Cebu, went on to claim the See of Manila and the governor generalship—both positions having been vacant simultaneously—to the dismay of the Real Audiencia. When that august body asked the good archbishop for his authority, Ezpeleta pointed to the troops he had summoned to surround the building where they were meeting. Nevertheless, when the replacement Manuel Rojo arrived from Spain, Ezpeleta stepped aside after an in tense period of negotiations. Ezpeleta was the first and last Filipino governor general under Spanish rule. Secular clergy, under the leadership of native-born Fr. Pedro Pelaez, spoke out against their unjust displacement. They raised funds to send an emissary to Madrid to plead their case, and Fr. Pelaez wrote two tracts in defense of the native clergy. A vigorous and articulate champion, the priest sadly perished, buried under the ruins of the Manila Cathedral as it was flattened by the earthquake of 1863. The denouement in this struggle of the native clergy to be accorded equal rights would come barely a decade later, in the aftermath of the 1872 Cavite Mutiny, its principal actor Fr. José Burgos, who had replaced Pelaez as canon of the cathedral. By the close of the eighteeenth century, the Catholic faith was firmly entrenched, the result of two-and-a-half centuries of assiduous proselytizing by the missionaries and the secular clergy. This did not mean, however, that these articles of faith brought over from Europe had completely supplanted pre- conquest beliefs and practices.

This did not mean, however, that these articles of faith brought over from Europe had completely supplanted pre- conquest beliefs and practices. In his Estadismo de las Islas Filipinas ( The Condition of the Philippine Islands ) Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, an Augustinian who served as parish priest in the islands just before the start of the nineteenth century, noted the persistence of what the Catholic Church dismissed as “superstitions.” These in cluded the continuing use of ritualistic practices in the burial of the dead and in dealing with their spirits; and the reliance, still, on amulets, or anting-anting to ward off demonic spirits and phantasmagoric creatures such as the Tikbalang, a monster that took various guises, and the Patianak, a mischievous figure that victimized pregnant women. The locals, according to Zúñiga, still clung to old beliefs in animist spirits, or nonos. Their at titudes implied a healthy respect for nature and the environment. Thus, “when they wish to pluck any flower or fruit, they ask permission of the genius or nono to pluck it. When they traverse any field, river, creek, big trees, groves, and other places, they ask for the good favor of the nonos. When they are obliged to cut any tree, they ask pardon of the nonos, and excuse the mselves to those things by saying, among other things, that the Padre or dered them to do it, and that it was not in their own purpose to fail in their respect to the genii, etc.” Zúñiga also noted the flourishing of the nayon, or barrio, outside the main population areas, where small groups of in habitants had enough to sustain the mselves sans extravagance, lived in a spirit of cooperation and harmony ( bayanihan ), and usually had a village elder to shape communal policies and adjudicate conflicts. In the nayon, life was a hybrid, an amalgam of traditional and Hispanicized mores. Its in habitant was liberated from the in sistent dogma of the priest and the church, free to construct a syncretic, personalized belief system. It was a rebellion, sans violence, sans fanfare, neither accepting colonial rule completely nor rejecting it outright. A modern counterpart to the colonial nayon can be found in peaceful, agrarian, religious communities living on the slopes of Mt. Banahaw, in the southern Tagalog region not too far from Manila and considered to be a sacred mountain. There, combining elements of Christianity and folklore, the deification of local heroes, particularly José Rizal (whose life will be examined in the next chapter), and the recentering of the female as a spiritual force, homegrown cults live amicably side by side, free of the proselytizing and dogmatic fever of the larger, or ganized religions. T HE C RESCENT A GAINST THE C ROSS While the spread of Islam throughout the archipelago was halted by the arrival of the Spanish, they were unable to dominate most of Muslim Mindanao until the last two decades of the nineteenth century, and only then as an occupation force. The situation was the reverse of that in Spain. Islam was an older presence in Southeast Asia, with Christianity the new kid on the block. On the Iberian peninsula, it was of course the exact opposite. The Moors had conquered most of Spain and held on to the peninsula for 700 years, until they were finally driven out by the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, with the reconquest of the last Moorish stronghold, Granada, in 1492. By melding religious zeal with nationalistic fervor, Ferdinand and Isabella had created a powerful and heady quasi-ideology. After the Reconquista, zealotry was the or der of the day, spurring the Spaniards to both colonize and Christianize South and Central America and islands in the Caribbean and in Southeast Asia. The most telling manifestation of that zealotry was the Spanish Inquisition, promulgated by Ferdinand and Isabella, who used Catholicism as an in strument of national solidarity, for cing the conversion of Jews, for in stance, to Christianity and otherwise expelling non-believers and persecuting and even putting to death alleged heretics. Its most in famous advocate was Tomás de Torquemada, who was appointed Inquisitor General in 1483, held the post for fifteen years, and is believed to have had 2,000 people put to death for alleged crimes against the faith. Because of Islam, different ethnolinguistic groups in Mindanao and Sulu, mainly the Maranao, Tausug, and Maguindanao, had the most developed social or ganization. With more pronounced social stratifications, economic and religious contacts with fellow Muslims in Southeast Asia, and the ability to forge alliances, Muslim Mindanao could and did of fer stronger, more or ganized, and determined resistance to Spanish claims to their territory. Had Legazpi not appeared on the horizon, or even if he did but later on—say, at the beginning of the seventeenth century—most of the archipelago might very well have already come under the Crescent, whether as an in dependent state, a conglomeration of sultanates, or in corporated into either Indonesia or Malaysia. The fact that the Muslims resisted Spanish domination is a source of pride for modern-day Filipino nationalists, though the notion then of defending a Philippine nation-state was in conceivable. Still, the Muslim raids on Luzon and the Visayas can be viewed, at the same time that the Spanish portrayed them as piratical, as both retaliation and resistance to colonialism. But there were other factors that contributed to their freedom from Spanish rule. For one thing, Manila and Luzon were front and center the focus of Spanish at tention. For another, the Spaniards had to fend off threats from rival powers such as the Dutch and the Portuguese (and later the British), as well as putting down uprisings in the areas under their control, hobbling their efforts to assemble a large enough force to dominate the Muslims"

For another, the Spaniards had to fend off threats from rival powers such as the Dutch and the Portuguese (and later the British), as well as putting down uprisings in the areas under their control, hobbling their efforts to assemble a large enough force to dominate the Muslims. Commercial in terests were another factor in the in tense rivalry between the Spanish and the Muslim Filipinos, particularly those of the Sulu Sultanate. With China, defeated by Great Britain in 1842 at the conclusion of the First Opium War, being for ced to open up to Western trade, the sultanate developed into a vital trading center due to its strategic location and rich natural resources—the for tuitous combination of which made the sultanate a powerful player in the region. Jolo, the capital of Sulu, traded with various Asian ports, in cluding Bengal, Canton, Macao, Manila, Borneo, and Singapore. Between 1768 and 1848 the sultanate enjoyed an ascendancy that Manila simultaneously resented and utilized for its own commercial in terests. Such goods from Jolo as pearls, to rtoise shell, shark’s fin, bird’s nest, cinnamon, rattan, ebony, cocoa, and cinnamon—produce of the sea and the for ests—were prized by English traders due to the demand in China for such products. The rise to power of the Taosug (the dominant ethnic group in Sulu) in turn meant their importation of weapons, rice, Chinese ceramics and earthenware, silk clothing, to bacco, wine, glassware, and even opium from India. Luxury goods reinforced elite status and were used to in duce loyalty as well as for bride purchases. Sulu’s control of the regional trade—in what the historian James Francis Warren described as the “Sulu Zone”—enabled the sultanate not only to hold on to its sovereignty but assert its regional dominance until the closing decades of the nineteenth century, when, Warren writes, “the Spanish naval campaigns of the 1870 s and the large-scale immigration of Straits Chinese provided the for mula for the economic and political collapse of the Sulu trading sphere.” The Sultanate’s primacy rested a great deal on its slave raiding traditions, traditions that had always been a feature of the chiefly kingdoms in the archipelago but now in tensified in the case of the sultanate with the need for more manpower, whether in the fields, seas, or in the port, where educated slaves would handle the books and manage the local elites’ business affairs—in the process, a number of them amassing considerable wealth and essentially living as freemen. In this system trade and slavery for med a circle: trade created considerable wealth and power while slavery provided the necessary labor to keep the machinery of trade well oiled. Thus, as trade expanded, so did slave raiding expeditions. Sponsored by the sultanates of both Cotabato and Sulu (with Jolo as the focal point), the raids bedeviled the rest of the archipelago, especially the Visayan Islands, and the coastal to wns of northeastern Mindanao and southern Luzon. The economic and social costs were enormous, ranging from depopulated villages to the disruption of in terisland shipping, particularly in the Visayas. Some of the slave-raiding fleets were enormous, consisting of forty to fifty for tified prahus (similar to the outrigger boat but with a heavier and deeper hull), around 2,500 to 3,000 fighters (mostly Moros from the Maranao or Cotabato region, and the Balangigi isles), and cannon. Slaves were trafficked to Dutch and Bornean ports as well as to Jolo. Captives could be ransomed, with a captured Spanish friar at the top of the list: he commanded the royal sum of 2,000 pesos, while an or dinary European fetched only 300 pesos and a male Filipino slave a measly thirty to fifty pesos. There were periodic military campaigns waged against the Moros, but victory by arms was rarely followed by sustained occupation on the ground. The gains were thus temporary. For in stance, even though a Spanish contingent that in cluded Christian Filipinos assaulted Jolo in 1578 and defeated its sultan, he and his followers were able to rebuild once the Spanish with drew. From then on, Muslim raids on coastal to wns in the Visayas took on a punitive as well as acquisitive character. Later, in 1635, to help defend against such raids the Spanish erected a for tified settlement, Zamboanga, in northwestern Mindanao, where to day Fort del Pilar still stands. With Zamboanga as his base, Governor Corcuera headed a full-scale expedition against the Moros in February 1637. His force of 760 Spaniards and thousands of Christian Filipinos captured Lanao and, the following year, took Jolo after a protracted siege of three and a half months. Convinced that he had broken Muslim power, Corcuera returned to Manila in May 1638 where he was hailed as a conqueror. In truth, for most of the Spanish colonial era, the Moros were never subjugated even in the light of such defeats. They would regroup, and the cycle of conflict would begin anew, essentially affirming the status quo, except for short-lived treaties between the sultanates and the Spanish regime. The Spanish were too few, and faced too many threats from elsewhere. Instead they relied on a network of forts, watchtowers, and warships to guard against Muslim depredations. Watchtowers were of ten strategically located right by the town church so that bells could be rung in warning should Muslim prahus be sighted. There were watchtowers as far north as Laoag and Aparri in northern Luzon, but none on the eastern flanks of the archipelago, though the Pacific side did have occasional patrols. By 1848 the Spanish had grown weary of English encroachment on its southern territories—or what it considered its territories, though the Muslims would have violently disagreed. Mistrust of their perennial rivals was only heightened in 1849 with a treaty of commerce and friendship between Sultan Mohammed Fadl of Sulu and the British government. This time, Manila decided to cripple the Sultanate’s base"

Under Governor General Antonio Urbiztondo and with for tified Zamboanga as its launching pad, a flotilla of steam gunboats as well as sailing ships, close to 3,000 soldiers, and nearly a thousand Filipino conscripts, set out for Jolo in 1851. Fighting was fierce but not prolonged. The steam gunboats made short work of the Moro prahus. In the end, the sultan and his datus retreated into the island’s rugged in terior. Shortly the reafter, a treaty was struck, wherein Sultan Fadl acknowledged Spain’s hegemony, agreed to severe restrictions on for eign trade, and allowed a Spanish naval presence in Jolo, to in terdict for eign vessels and prevent or minimize the importation of weapons. But the treaty was doomed, since neither side really observed its provisos. Urbiztondo had failed to establish a garrison in the capital. Hence, the sultanate continued to trade as before. Only in 1875 did the situation change, when the Spanish colonial government launched a much larger war fleet: nine thousand soldiers (a majority of whom were Filipinos), eleven transport ships, and twenty-two gunboats. In late February, the Spanish flattened Jolo and destroyed nearby Taosug strongholds in the following weeks. This time, a Spanish occupation force remained, erecting forts and rebuilding Jolo, as a European-style city complete with a wall. It was only in 1899 that the Spanish departed, giving way to the new plantation owners: the United States of America. The fact that Christianized natives were regularly employed in the campaigns against the Moros, who were considered beyond the pale, did little to endear them to the latter. Not surprisingly, they subsequently viewed each other with mutual suspicion. Despite racial and cultural ties, each to each was the Other: for eign and hostile—an animosity that persists to this day and complicates efforts to negotiate a lasting peace on both sides of the religious and cultural divide."

They don’t expect knowledge or enthusiasm from a schoolmaster. They just want resignation, humility, in ertia.” —José Rizal, Noli Me Tangere (trans. H. Augenbraum) M ORE THAN ANY OTHER F ILIPINO SUBJECT TO S PANISH COLONIAL rule, the medical doctor, brilliant polymath, and writer José Rizal, in his in cendiary 1887 novel Noli Me Tangere, exposed the state of the archipelago as it was during the waning decades of Spanish hegemony. The voice of the town schoolteacher lamenting his predicament to the protagonist Crisostomo Ibarra echoed eerily the voice of the politicized Indios who, though acutely aware of the need for changes in their society, felt powerless to work for these, blocked by the reactionary character of the dominant figure of the time, the friar; the narrow strictures of education; and a civil administration in different at best and mindlessly cruel at worst. (The sequel to the Noli, El Filbusterismo, or The Subversive, followed in 1891. Even darker in its appraisal of the colonial regime, the Fili, as it was commonly referred to, confirmed Rizal’s pariah status in the eyes of the Spanish overseers.) In the book, the rich Ibarra, recently returned from studies and travels in Europe, personified the ilustrados, “enlightened ones,” who like Rizal and his peers were scions of the rising haute bourgeoisie and the refore had the means to go abroad to seek either further education, political exile, or simply a better life. For the most part, the ilustrados chose Madrid or Barcelona, with some opting to live in Paris. The Europe of fin de siècle nineteenth century had long been steeped in the ideas of the Enlightenment, the zeitgeist heady with the promise of liberty and equality, with its emphasis on in dividual rights, the centrality of reason, and the repudiation of oligarchy, whether in the realm of civil government or religious authority. Perhaps the most violent (and contradictory) manifestation of the Enlightenment’s impact on the Ancien Régime was the French Revolution of 1789. European capitals provided the hothouse in tellectual at mosphere that young, in tellectually curious Filipinos lacked in Manila. The opening up of the colony to in ternational trade at the start of the nineteenth century resulted in a burgeoning middle class, which in turn meant the sons of these upwardly mobile families could be sent to colleges and universities both in Manila and Europe—an in dispensable factor in the development of a national and nationalist consciousness. Principally through the actions and writings of the ilustrados, the currents of reform reached Las Islas Filipinas, so that the islands were in evitably affected by radical political and social changes in Europe. Change may have boarded a slow boat to Manila, but it was coming. Spanish society had already undergone fundamental changes by the time the ilustrados arrived in Europe. The Southeast Asian colony was on the margins of the Spanish empire, distant enough so that these changes did not resonate in stantly or as powerfully as might have been otherwise expected. Nevertheless, political and social alterations in Spain were bound to have an effect on the far- away archipelago. The combination of the Enlightenment with the upheavals brought about by the French Revolution contributed to the spread of liberal ideas in Spain. Specifically, the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 to 1815, continent-wide conflicts that pitted the armies of Napoleon against a varying cast of opponents, further accelerated change and the decline of the old or der. The French in vasion and occupation of Spain led to the Spanish War of Independence (1808-1814). Spanish resistance to the Napoleonic in vasion, assisted by the British surreptitiously, brought about the temporary ascendancy of the Spanish liberals who produced the Cádiz Constitution of 1812, which extended democratic rights not only to Spaniards but also to all non-Spanish subjects of Madrid. Additionally, reflecting the prevalent liberal spirit, the Cádiz Constitution set limits on the monarchy. The Cortes, or Spanish Parliament, was revived and now allowed for a representative from each colony, in cluding the Philippines. The first representative for the archipelago was Ventura de los Reyes, who served from 1810 to 1813. The unheralded de los Reyes was one of the signatories of the Cádiz Constitution, promulgated in March of 1812, but proclaimed in Manila only a year after, in 1813.

In 1814, however, the monarchy was restored, with Ferdinand VII reigning, and the liberal provisions of the Cortes revoked. In 1815 there were violent reactions in the archipelago to this revocation. News of the Cádiz constitution had reached the islands only in 1813, so its revocation after a little more than a year was viewed with suspicion by the in digenous population, who felt that the principalia arbitrarily and capriciously determined how the laws were to be in terpreted and enforced. By 1820, there was yet another swing to wards Republicanism: the constitutional period was brought back, and Ferdinand exiled. At the same time, direct mail service was established between Spain and the Philippines. The Cortes, revived yet again, approved certain measures specific to the Philippines. Trade was further liberalized, so that products and goods manufactured in the islands were now considered “national,” and thus entitled to the privileges and immunities the law bestowed on Spanish goods. These steps were undertaken essentially to stimulate native entrepreneurship. With the declaration of Mexico’s in dependence from Spain in 1821, Manila ceased to be administratively ruled from Mexico. It now had to be governed directly from far-away Spain, though the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was to shorten the distance considerably, bringing travel time down to five weeks, from the previous three to four months. Another swing to the right in Madrid occurred in 1823, when Ferdinand was restored to absolute power by the French, wielding it until his death in 1833. Predictably, the king revoked the constitution, abolished the Cortes, and in validated its legislative work. By the time of Ferdinand’s restoration, only Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas remained Spanish colonies. Subsequent to Ferdinand’s death, the question of succession proved destabilizing, leading to the Carlist Wars. Essentially a long-running civil war between those who moved to uphold monarchism and tradition and those who favored the continuation of Enlightenment legacies of secularism and a republican form of government, the wars spanned more than four decades, from 1833 to 1876 (though the Civil War that erupted in 1936, between Republican for ces and General Franco and the Falangists can be seen as the endpoint of this conflict). Once more, the Cortes was revived, but this time with limited powers. Queen Cristina, Regent of Spain, or dered it to craft a new constitution. The result: the Constitution of 1837, which established a parliamentary form of government. However, in a blow to the rights of colonies, their right to representation was abolished. Its restoration was one of the goals which the ilustrados would demand. E DUCATION AND THE S PREAD OF I DEAS As the expatriate Indio community in Spain began to grow, there were at tempts to improve the education system archipelago-wide, following an 1839 royal decree. Indeed, a marine school was established in Manila in 1840, its aim to graduate trained pilots for ships sailing to mainland Asia, Europe, or North America. However, while there were primary schools in to wns and villages, these were handicapped by in adequate facilities and the lack of trained teachers. Moreover, local schools were under the control of the local friar, as they had been since the start of the colonial period. More than anything else, the friar was keen to see his young charges learn their catechism by heart, and not in encouraging their faculties of in dependent thinking. For most of Spanish colonial rule, very little legislation existed that dealt with schooling; it was left to the religious or ders to in troduce a systematic method of primary education. At the outset of colonial rule in the late sixteenth century, the Augustinians—the first religious or der in the colony—in structed its parishes to set up schools throughout the archipelago. In 1634 and 1636, archbishops and bishops were asked by Philip IV to educate the in digenous people. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the Crown decreed that primary in struction should be free, and in 1792, Charles III suggested that schools should be supervised by civil authorities, an implicit recognition that education was mainly if not to tally handled by the religious. Government legislation never established a detailed, consistent plan on educational methods for primary schools, even though royal or ders placed emphasis on education, particularly with regard to the construction of buildings, the recruitment of divinity teachers, and the teaching of Spanish. However, with the Educational Decree of 1863, the home government required the establishment of schools and the availability of free primary in struction for children between the ages of seven and twelve. This in evitably improved the system that heretofore privileged only the peninsulares and the native wealthy. One of the goals was for the young to learn Castilian. At any one time, only a small percentage of the subject population—estimated at between 5 to 10 percent—was fluent in Spanish, and this decree was meant to in crease that percentage. But the goal that superseded everything else was still the imparting of Christian doctrine, morality, and what was termed “sacred history”—basically a study of the Bible—to be directed by the parish priest. (Not surprisingly, the first book printed in the colony, in 1593, was the Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Española y Tagalog, or the Christian Catechism in Spanish and Tagalog.) The 1863 decree meant the government taking charge of higher education; of ficial recognition of educational in stitutions established by the religious or ders; a determination of teacher qualifications; and a pay scale"

The 1863 decree meant the government taking charge of higher education; of ficial recognition of educational in stitutions established by the religious or ders; a determination of teacher qualifications; and a pay scale. In turn, the religious or ders gave up some higher-education tasks and focused on free primary, compulsory education for all children of both sexes. After the Maura decree of 1893, schools became free from in spection by the parish priests and the reafter became the responsibility of the local governments. By 1898, the last year of Spanish rule, one reliable estimate put the number of state schools at 2,143, excluding private and religious schools. The educational system in the colony may have developed in fits and starts, but by the time of the American takeover, there was enough of an in frastructure in place for American educators to implement an island-wide public-school system. Having been at it for nearly three centuries, the religious or ders had shaped the landscape of higher education in the country by founding colleges and universities. Among these is the oldest educational in stitution in the country, the University of San Carlos, established by the Spanish Jesuits in Cebu in 1595 but now run by the Society of the Divine Word or der. All other noteworthy schools were founded in Manila: Colegio de San José (1603), founded by the Jesuits; University of Santo Tomás (1611) and the College of San Juan de Letrán (1620), both established by the Dominicans; and La Concordia College, founded exclusively for women by the Daughters of Charity in 1868. Outside of these universities, seminaries run by the religious of fered secondary education to lay students. The 1863 decree also established a normal school for teachers in Manila, to be under the direction of the Jesuits, who having been expelled in 1768, had been allowed to return to the colony in 1859. (That same year, the Jesuits took over the Escuela Municipal de Manila, which in 1865 was raised to the status of a college, the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, now the private Ateneo de Manila university, the third-oldest university in the country.) The normal school was to serve as an educational center for God-fearing and obedient potential teachers. Again, at the top of the list of in tended goals was the imparting of religion, morals, and sacred history. The unremitting emphasis on religious tutelage allowed Catholicism to be deeply entrenched, of ten at the expense of the secular pursuit of knowledge. As educational reforms began to take effect, however sporadically, the number of journals and newspapers in creased. There were seventy-four during the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Among the better known were La Opiníon, Manila Alegre, El Comercio, El Correo, El Católico Filipino, and Diario de Manila. A majority of the publications were in Spanish, and some were bilingual—an in dication not only of the spread of literacy but of news, however modified by the powers that be, outside of Manila. All had to contend with a board of censors that had been set up in 1856, made up of four appointees by the governor and four appointees by the archbishop of Manila, for ever on the lookout for articles that might impugn either the state or the church—or both. As imperfect as it was, the educational system heading into the latter half of the nineteenth century, along with economic and social changes brought about by the opening up of the colony to in ternational trade, did turn out an in telligentsia, among them the ilustrados, the sons of upwardly mobile mestizo and in dio families who had grown critical of colonial rule, and were at the for efront of the reformist movement that came to be known as the Propaganda Movement. But laying the ground for the political awakening of their generation were upheavals in the country’s religious ranks. S ECULARIZATION AND THE C ATACLYSM OF 1872 Presaging the concerted demands for Filipinization of parishes, as well as the revolutionary brotherhood, the Katipunan, which would spring up in 1892, a devout Indio peasant by the name of Apolinario de la Cruz, having had his application to join a friar or der in Manila rejected in 1839, returned to the southern Tagalog provinces and for med the Cofradía de San José, or Confraternity of St. Joseph. De la Cruz (known in the Confraternity as Hermano, or Brother, Pule) was clearly a charismatic leader, for the lay religious brotherhood soon at tracted numerous adherents, whose contributions enabled the Cofradía to sponsor regular masses for its followers, and even fiestas. The authorities, both civil and religious, viewed the confraternity with skepticism and deep suspicion. The church hierarchy refused to recognize its activities as legitimate, and its members were routinely harassed. Institutional disdain and contempt led de la Cruz and the Cofradía to assert the mselves as an in dependent group, claiming to have divine support and refusing anyone but full-blooded natives membership. Mestizos could be accepted but only with de la Cruz’s express consent. At times his followers would proclaim de la Cruz as “King of the Tagalogs”—a clear reference to Christ being heralded as the King of the Jews. Inevitably the state, acting on requests by the friars, acted to suppress what was seen as a potentially explosive in surgent movement by sending troops to the Cofradía’s stronghold in Tayabas, now Quezon, Province. Though in itially successful in repulsing the at tacks, Pule and his confraternity were defeated. At the age of twenty-seven, the would-be priest and his aide, called Purgatorio, were executed along with 200 other members of the Cofradía. De la Cruz’s body was dismembered, his severed head stuck on a pole placed by the roadside in a manner reminiscent of the deaths of Christian martyrs at the hands of the Romans"

De la Cruz’s body was dismembered, his severed head stuck on a pole placed by the roadside in a manner reminiscent of the deaths of Christian martyrs at the hands of the Romans. The Cofradía’s clamor for change in the way religious groups were constituted was clearly emblematic of the groundswell of dissatisfaction with colonial rule and of the push for equal rights. Hence, the Filipinization of the clergy was not simply a religious issue but one in which broader social and economic issues came into play. Being that the Catholic Church and its priests (particularly the Spanish friars) represented the apex of Philippine colonial society, priesthood was viewed by many of the more ambitious natives as a sure means of social and even material advancement. The Jesuits’ return in 1859 revived the issue of Filipinization. Their earlier, for ced departure in 1768 resulted in vacant curacies, especially in northern Mindanao. With not enough Spanish clergy to go around, these had gone to Filipino secular priests. Now, there was an or der to transfer curacies in the Bishopric of Manila from native clergy to the Spanish religious or ders, to accommodate those displaced by the returning Jesuits. The or der to vacate what they had administered capably for more than ninety years embittered many of the seculars. (They had to give up, for in stance, one of the wealthiest parishes in the colony, that of Antipolo, not far from Manila, and the archipelago’s most famous pilgrimage site devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Voyage.) The of ficial reasons, they felt, disparaged their abilities and cast aspersions on their character. These feelings would persist and lead many secular native priests later on to adopt nationalist causes. A breakdown in 1870 showed that out of a to tal of 792 parishes, 611 were administered by regular priests, i. e., belonging to the Orders, and 181 by secular priests, almost all of whom were Filipino. At the same time, political turmoil continued in Spain. The Spanish revolution of 1868 resulted in the for mation of yet another liberal, democratic form of government. The next year, 1869, the same year the Suez Canal was opened, the Cortes approved a new constitution, which established a limited monarchy; recognized in dividual freedom of expression, association, domicile, and worship; legalized civil marriages; and in troduced the jury system. A wealthy liberal, Carlos María de la Torre, was sent over to the colony as the new governor general. Once in stalled, de la Torre banned flogging in the military, lifted restrictions on the press, public demonstrations, and the for mation of associations aimed at reform, etc. The governor displayed his in tentions for a more democratic dispensation by having creoles and mestizos at the Palace and proposing to asts to “Liberty!” He took the unusual step of pardoning a group of dissidents in nearby Cavite province, who had been in volved in agrarian disputes with local landowners. He had these same dissidents form a police force. De la Torre also went on walks in Intramuros sans the traditional armed escort in their fancy uniforms. Not surprisingly, such behavior scandalized the long-time Spanish expatriates and clergy, who feared this display of liberalism would only encourage the lowly natives to become uppity and entertain ideas of a free society. Naturally the rising bourgeoisie—native and mestizo alike—hailed him. Unfortunately for this budding reform movement, Amadeo of Savoy was in stalled as king, and the leftward shift in Spain was arrested. De la Torre was recalled in 1871, and replaced by a right-winger Rafael de Izquierdo, who promptly restored the restrictions, and viewed with suspicion those who had supported de la Torre’s policies. More tellingly, he also with drew the exemption from tribute and for ced labor (the polos y servicios ) that the workers at the Cavite arsenal, the artillery barracks and engineer corps of Fort San Felipe—just across the bay from Intramuros—had enjoyed since 1740. The abolition of these privileges caused the men in the fort to mutiny on January 20, 1872. Though seven Spanish of ficers were killed, the mini-revolt, never more than a brushfire, was quickly suppressed over a period of two days, but the in cident was viewed as more than just a violent act of in subordination. Here was an opportunity to get rid of Filipino secular priests who had championed the Filipinization of the clergy—an in sistent demand seen at the for efront of in cipient nationalism. This demand had grown to in clude not only the native clerics but Creoles and Spanish mestizos as well. Among those swept into the net of suspected subversives were figures of social standing and three secular priests: Mariano Gómez, curate of the nearby town of Bacoor, Cavite; Jacinto Zamora, parish priest of Marikina Town, a suburb north of Manila; and José Burgos, a curate at the prestigious Manila Cathedral. Of the three, the most well-known was Fr. Burgos, one of the most vocal and in fluential champions of the Filipino secular clergy and who had made his views known to de la Torre. Born in 1837, he was at the age of thirty already a doctor of the ology and canon law, and the Synodal Examiner of the country’s preeminent See—the Cathedral of Manila. He was also an expert swordsman and knew how to box. Tireless in his advocacy of Filipinizing the parishes and in defense of his fellow Filipino priests, in 1869 Burgos penned “To the Spanish People.” Reading this eloquent essay, one can see why the Spanish friars detested him. He rebutted the baseless charges levied against the secular priests by La Verdad, or The Truth, a newspaper that clearly favored the entrenched Spanish clergy"

Tireless in his advocacy of Filipinizing the parishes and in defense of his fellow Filipino priests, in 1869 Burgos penned “To the Spanish People.” Reading this eloquent essay, one can see why the Spanish friars detested him. He rebutted the baseless charges levied against the secular priests by La Verdad, or The Truth, a newspaper that clearly favored the entrenched Spanish clergy. He cited the main charge: “‘… the Filipino who dedicates himself to the sacred of fice of the priesthood is wont to carry out faithfully and well the mechanical detail of church work but he never at tains to the point of excelling in anything connected with the solemn priestly functions.’” Burgos highlighted the friars’ refusal to obey royal decrees, especially that of 1863, commanding them to teach Spanish to their constituents. “So resolutely do the friars carry their in tentions to its undue lengths that they come to abhor in their parish the native who speaks Spanish.” He described the friars as “sand in the cog wheels of the country’s civilization” who “endeavor to keep the poor natives in a state of ignorance and boorishness”—the better to maintain both their in fluence and affluence. To for estall charges of treason, of being a filibustero, or subversive, he highlighted the secular priests’ services in the past, declared that their abilities were equal to the best of the friars, and reiterated above all how loyal the secular clergy was to Mother Spain. If only the motherland would open her eyes and see, she would recognize in stantly the great in justice that was being perpetuated. He accused the friar or ders of being in “possession of great riches and profitable estate in comes which they do their best to keep away from the eyes of the government,” riches that were “now unhappily available at all times and is too of ten put to ill use, in the in dulgence of pleasure, in the transgression of the law, in the corruption of justice and in the in fliction of harm to their fellowmen.” Strong, provocative words. In essence, Burgos had written a with ering critique of not just the Spanish friars but colonialism itself, for colonial rule had prospered precisely because it condoned the friars’ methods. Confrontation with the friars was in evitable, though things would not come to a head for two more decades. Spain justified her presence in the islands—in deed throughout her empire—based on the evangelical belief in Catholicism’s superiority and the imperative to spread it. Even though this religion brought over from Spain had sunk its roots deep in Philippine soil, the different localized resistance movements that rose out of deep despair, with the well of native for bearance running dry, had no choice but to see the friar as the main obstacle to freedom and, since the friar too was key to local economic development, material progress. Catholic the ology was acceptable, but its Iberian herald was in creasingly unwelcome. In a mock trial, and implicated by one mutineer, the clerics were promptly found guilty of plotting to overthrow the regime. Significantly, Archbishop Martínez of Manila refused to defrock them, an implicit endorsement of their professed in nocence, as well as a pointed rebuke of the friar or ders, who continually resisted the diocesan bishop’s right to visitation—a mechanism provided by the Patronato Real, through which oversight by the Royal Crown was exercised. On February 17, 1872, a month after the failed mutiny, Gómez, Burgos, and Zamora were publicly executed at the Luneta by means of the garrote, an iron collar bound around the condemned’s neck and then twisted until the neck is broken. Burgos, the last to be killed, shouted out his declaration of in nocence, to which one of the at tending friars is said to have chillingly remarked, “So was Jesus.” Ironically, the mutineer who had implicated the trio in the hopes of being pardoned or at least spared the death penalty, a man by the name of Saldua, was garroted as well. Others were imprisoned and twenty-two others, in cluding nine native priests, were banished to the Marianas Islands. A few of the banished laymen managed to make their way to Europe, among them Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and Antonio Regidor, who, along with other Filipino émigrés, for med the nucleus of an expatriate community that the later generation of Filipino upper-middle class in tellectuals would join. That the trials were patently unfair is clear in the rebuke the Supreme Military Council in Madrid (the highest military tribunal) delivered to the colonial government in Manila, stating that its conduct was a violation of the law, and warning against a repeat. No punishment was decreed, however, for such a violation. The Cavite Mutiny anticipated a much larger one when, on September 2 of the same year, close to 1,200 laborers in the same Cavite shipyards, according to Benedict Anderson in Under Three Flags, “went on the first recorded strike in Philippine history. Numerous people were arrested and in terrogated but the regime failed to find an arrestable mastermind and eventually all were released.” The peaceable strike was to protest the suspension of their privileges—the very same cause that sparked the brief armed in surrection. There was a practical side to the stirrings of nationalism. Their widening economic in terests made the colonized more aware of and sensitive to antiquated and unfair colonial policies, abetted by systemic racism and the denial of freedoms. This blatant oppression of liberal creoles, mestizos, and native clerics, though at other times strange bedfellows, resulted in a common cause being taken up. The drive to Filipinize the parishes was easily subsumed into the larger context of widespread discontent and the desire for substantial reforms. The fact that three men of the cloth had been killed in cold blood by the colonial state absolved would-be rebels from being castigated as anti-Catholic"

      "ground_truth_context": ". No punishment was decreed, however, for such a violation. The Cavite Mutiny anticipated a much larger one when, on September 2 of the same year, close to 1,200 laborers in the same Cavite shipyards, according to Benedict Anderson in Under Three Flags, “went on the first recorded strike in Philippine history. Numerous people were arrested and in terrogated but the regime failed to find an arrestable mastermind and eventually all were released.” The peaceable strike was to protest the suspension of their privileges—the very same cause that sparked the brief armed in surrection. There was a practical side to the stirrings of nationalism. Their widening economic in terests made the colonized more aware of and sensitive to antiquated and unfair colonial policies, abetted by systemic racism and the denial of freedoms. This blatant oppression of liberal creoles, mestizos, and native clerics, though at other times strange bedfellows, resulted in a common cause being taken up. The drive to Filipinize the parishes was easily subsumed into the larger context of widespread discontent and the desire for substantial reforms. The fact that three men of the cloth had been killed in cold blood by the colonial state absolved would-be rebels from being castigated as anti-Catholic. No longer; they could be seen as anti-exploitation and even anti-Spanish but not as heretics. After all, they had priests on their side. Their souls were the refore not at risk of being damned, as the friars of ten warned those whom they deemed in sufficiently subservient. The 1872 Gomburza Affair, as it came to be known, planted the seeds of nationalist awakening in and politicized the younger generation, already exposed to Enlightenment ideas. In less than a decade, beginning in 1880, the Propaganda Movement would coalesce when Marcelo H. del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, and José Rizal—with other like-minded and older compatriots who had sought refuge in Europe earlier—systematically advocated for reforms. The Propagandists gave voice and shape to the growing aspirations of not just their social class but of the lower classes who, as always, felt most keenly the boot of social and economic oppression. In the end, though the Propaganda Movement failed to at tain its objectives, it did lead to a heightened consciousness among various social classes, culminating in the 1896 Revolution against Spain. (One in dication of how the martyrdom of the three clerics still resonated more than two decades later was the use of “Gomburza” as a password among the revolutionaries.) The Chinese Mestizos Even as a nationalist consciousness was emerging, fuelled by ilustrado aims and the unruly dreams of a restless populace grown both tired and testy due to habitual Spanish repression, the Chinese community was itself undergoing changes as many of its members, assimilating into native society, came to play an in creasingly crucial role in the colonial economy. One way to assimilate was to convert to Catholicism, and adopt a Christian name. By 1755, Chinese mestizos—usually the of fspring of a Chinese father and native mother—came to dominate rice trading, supplying Manila with much of its needs. They the refore acquired farm lands or leased from the religious estates. In turn, the Chinese mestizos, either as owners or in quilinos (lessees), allowed kasamas or sharecroppers to till the soil, in exchange for half of the harvest. A vast majority of the tenant farmers had once owned their small farms but, failing to acquire titles to the land they and their families had worked for generations, lost them. A law passed in 1894 was particularly disastrous: landowners were given only one year in which to secure titles. A great number of small landowners, especially in the rural areas, were unaware of the new law. Not surprisingly, not much effort was made to spread news of this legislation. To their dismay their plots were suddenly in corporated in the titles secured by big landowners. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at least 400,000 persons found the mselves in this predicament, unable to avoid the humbling status of tenancy. From the amassing of lands came the haciendas. The hacienda was an outgrowth of the new system that emphasized the cultivation of cash crops. Though modern in its or ientation to wards capitalism, management was decidedly feudal in the way overseers treated the tenant farmers and itinerant laborers who showed up every harvest—an exploitative system that continues to day. While it is true that debt slavery and sharecropping existed even in the pre-Hispanic period, it is just as true that under the Spanish these exploitative aspects were not only exacerbated but in stitutionalized as well. One of the biggest was the Hacienda Luisita, to taling close to 16,000 acres and encompassing lands in several to wns in what is now Tarlac Province. Originally deeded as a royal grant to the Tabacalera Company in 1880, it was eventually acquired by the Chinese mestizo family, the Cojuangcos, who have since figured as a political and social dynasty nationwide (the successor to president-turned- dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 was a member of the Cojuangco clan: Corazon Cojuangco Aquino). As in quilinos—Rizal’s father was one—many Chinese mestizos grew wealthy, and along with their wealth and accumulated land, became vested in the on going development of the economy. They competed with alcalde mayors or provincial governors, the religious or ders, and the ethnically pure Chinese in positioning the mselves economically. Along with their new economic power, the Chinese mestizos acquired social status, facilitating assimilation and participation as part of the non-Spanish elite of society. In the emergence of a Filipino nation, this elite—a mixture of Chinese mestizos, Creoles, and the rising native middle and upper classes—played a crucial role. In effect, they constituted the new principalia. Inevitably, their ever-in creasing desire for economic expansion, equated with a freer marketplace, kept bumping against the narrow, monopolistic policies of the old regime. Combined with the burgeoning sense of nationalism and the centuries-old resentments of the in dios, the restlessness of the economic elite proved to be an explosive factor. Out of these volatile elements emerged a tangible sense of being a Filipino and the notion of a nation-state to which such Filipinos might belong—an “imagined community,” to use Benedict Anderson’s apt phrase. The term “Filipino” was or iginally applied only to Creoles—Spaniards born in the Philippines. The Spaniards who had come over from the motherland didn’t care for the designation, preferring in stead the term “Peninsulares,” implying a snobbish hierarchy.

Anyone outside these two categories was simply an Indio— the term or iginally used by Columbus for the natives of the Caribbean, which he mistook for the Indies, or Spice Islands, of Asia. However, due to economic progress and a growing sense of a common cultural Hispanicized background that cut across ethnic boundaries, the Creoles, the mestizos (both Chinese and Spanish), and the educated natives came to view the mselves as “Filipinos.” The ilustrados were at the for efront of extending the term to all local in habitants of Las Islas Filipinas—except for the Muslims, or Moros, who had never identified with the Christian majority and in deed resisted the in cursions of the colonial state. T HE P ROPAGANDA M OVEMENT In Spain, in the meantime, political changes continued apace. In 1871 Amadeo, son of King Victor Emmanuel of Italy, was of fered and accepted the job of King of Spain but proved unable to rule effectively. Shortly after an assassination at tempt on his queen, he stepped down in February of 1873. After two years of political turbulence, Alfonso, son of the previously deposed Queen Isabella, gained the Spanish throne, his reign, from 1875 to 1885, a period of relative calm. The Cortes was revived and passed a new constitution in 1876. While Cuba and Puerto Rico were once again given representation, the Philippines was not; the Asian colony was to be governed by a set of special laws. Thus, political changes and upheavals in Spain would be followed in evitably by shakeups in the Philippines, which had become a dumping ground for largely unqualified followers and favorites of well-connected patrons in the motherland. Such changes were superficial and frequent, as can be gauged by the fact that from 1850 to 1898, twenty-four governors general served in the Philippines, for an average term of two years. Plus ça change, plus c’est le meme chose: The purported changes only meant more of the same, with the colonial system plagued by corruption and systemic abuse. Real and abiding power lay in the hands of the civil administrators, especially the governor general, who had essentially dictatorial powers, and of the friar or ders. They usually ignored, or in terpreted narrowly, decrees from Madrid that they didn’t like. Thus, the in junction to teach Spanish archipelago-wide to the Indios was observed haphazardly by the religious, who controlled education in the islands. Compounding the situation were the unabashedly racist views held by the Spanish of ficials, who tended to be domineering, contemptuous, and of ten physically abusive to wards the Indio. This was especially true at the local level, none more abusive than the Guardia Civil, notorious for manhandling villagers who may not have displayed the proper at titude of obeisance (like doffing their salakots, or native hats, promptly). Rizal’s mother herself was for ced to trek fifty kilometers from Calamba to the provincial capital Santa Cruz, where she was kept in jail on charges, never proven, by the mayor in collusion with the head of the local Guardia Civil. She had been falsely implicated as an accomplice in a purported plot, never proven, by her half-brother to poison his wife. In 1880, two years before he set sail for Europe, the son himself felt literally the heavy hand of authority. In a letter Rizal wrote of “being mauled and wounded one dark night by the Guardia Civil, for having passed by a statue and failing to salute it. The statue turned out to be the lieutenant commander of the detachment.” Rizal at tempted to report this in justice to Primo de Rivera, the governor general at the time, but was unable to see him. While the refore gains had been made in trade and commerce (though still at the neglect of the in dustrial sector, which was in an embryonic state), and while in frastructure and communications had improved, no comparable gains had been made in the arena of personal and political freedoms. The gap between material progress and civil liberties was one the in tellectuals and visionaries fervently sought to close. The Propaganda Movement, an outgrowth of the 1872 Mutiny, was a crusade carried out clandestinely in Manila and openly in Spain by scions from the expanding ranks of the native bourgeoisie. This movement, while directly a result of the killings of the three martyr priests, can be traced further back, according to the writer Nick Joaquin, to the waning years of the eighteenth century. A number of Creole writers in the colony espoused the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. They were anti-clerical and pushed for the same reforms the ilustrados would lobby to wards the end of the nineteenth century. In particular, Luis Rodríguez Varela was the writer who, in Joaquin’s words, “can most truly be called the precursor of Philippine nationalism.” Varela called himself “El Conde Filipino” or the Filipino Count, and was the first to describe himself as a Filipino in print. (It is true the Creoles were described as “Filipinos” by the peninsular Spanish but the Creoles the mselves until Varela preferred to be called “Spaniards.”) He wrote several books that advocated social change and the liberalizing of education to in clude free in struction for the poor.

The aim of the Propagandists was to put pressure on the Spanish government by spotlighting for the Spanish public the in justices and backwardness of Spanish rule in the archipelago. The hoped-for result, however, was to be meaningful reforms, assimilation rather than a separation from Mother Spain, wherein Filipinos had standing equal to any other Spaniard. The Propagandists were especially keen on abrogating the role of the friar or ders in civil government, removing them from their curacies, and replacing them with Filipino secular priests. In Spain, they allied the mselves with anti-clerical factions. Testimony by Fr. Juan Villegas, a Franciscan, before the Philippine Commission in 1900, at the start of the United States colonial era, catalogued the powers that his confrères wielded during Spanish colonial times: “He was in spector of primary schools; president of the health board and board of charities; president of the board of urban taxation.… He certified to the correctness of cedulas [tax certificates] … was president of the board of statistics…. The priest also certified as to the civil status of persons.” Before the same commission, a certain Florentino Torres stated: “The local authorities took no step, obeyed no superior or ders and did not perform the duties of their of fice with out previous advice, permission, or knowledge of the friar curate, since the protection of the latter sufficed at times to defy the anger of the governor of the province and paralyze or evade the action of justice.” Such evidentiary testimony bore out the fictional world eloquently detailed two decades earlier in Rizal’s novels. In summary, as the historian Reynaldo Ileto put it, in his Filipinos and Their Revolution, “The Spanish priest was the equivalent of the god-king elsewhere in Southeast Asia.” Thus, notwithstanding their excesses, the friars constituted the de facto bulwark of Spanish colonial rule and were the refore in dispensable. To further solidify their in dispensability, the friars resisted any systematic at tempt for the Indios to learn Spanish. The main reason the friars so assiduously learned the various native languages was so that only they could mediate between the in digenous population and the civil state. The very act of mediating, the ability to move in both spheres at the same time, conferred upon them a great deal of power. For in the eyes of the civil authorities, the alternative—allowing native priests to control most curacies—would mean opening the floodgates of nationalism. Originally the slur against the native priest was his alleged in competence. Now, he was grudgingly perceived as being in telligent but his loyalty to Mother Spain was doubtful. He was likely to be seditious, and, as a high of ficial put it, either “a disgrace for the clergy or … a peril for the colony.” And yet, the ilustrados saw the mselves as faithful sons of Spain, in a sense, more Spanish than the Spanish. To them, the friars and other avatars of colonial rule were the unfaithful subjects, the subversives. Echoing the plaints of Fr. Burgos, the ilustrados believed that if only the mother country saw them in a positive light and extended to them and to the rest of the Indios the same rights as their brothers in the Iberian Peninsula, then all would be set right. Three groups for med the nucleus of the Propaganda Movement. There were those who, having been implicated in the 1872 Mutiny and exiled to the Marianas Islands, had made their way to Europe; a decade later came young men seeking higher education; and third were those fleeing persecution in the colony. The nucleus of the Filipino expatriate community in Madrid counted among its earliest members Gregorio Sancianco and the Paterno brothers. Coming from a well-to-do family in the colony, the Paternos held a regular salon at their residence for writers and political figures. One of the brothers, Pedro, was a poet, the the mes of whose collection of verse, titled Sampaguita y Poesias, published in 1880, were specifically Filipino. Except for the fact that this was the first such book by a Filipino, the verses were apparently for gettable. Pedro also penned a novel, Ninay, that, like Sampaguita, failed to garner any critical praise. Published in 1907, Ninay did have the distinction of being the first novel written in Tagalog. A Chinese mestizo, Sancianco, on the other hand, wrote El Progreso de Filipinas in 1881, a study that examined Philippine colonial society from the standpoint of material progress. Not surprisingly, its author concluded that due to corruption and backward economic and social policies, the country had shown very little development. Government services and the country’s in frastructure demanded radical improvements. The tax structure was highly in equitable, and the tribute levied on the Indios was both racist and unfair. He pointed out that those with the least had to pay the most, while the tribute was demanded of everyone in the Philippines, except the Spanish, whether peninsular or in sular. The tribute had to be abolished and the present tax system replaced by one directly related to the ability to pay. Since the colony should be considered a province of Spain, it followed that its in habitants were to be viewed as Spanish citizens and treated accordingly. Sancianco also assailed the monopoly the religious had over education in the colony. He said students wished for a more rational and secular curriculum, and suggested that the civil government rather than the church take over the tasks of schooling. Though largely ignored, Sancianco’s critique of the Philippines under Spanish rule was accurate, its the mes propounded later on by ilustrado writers such as Rizal, who occasionally referred to him in his letters.

The Propaganda Movement had reformist rather than revolutionary goals. Among these were: recognition of the colony as a province of Spain; equal treatment of Filipinos; freedom of the press; curtailment of Guardia Civil abuses; representation in the Cortes; and secularization of the parishes. Its main mouthpiece was La Solidaridad, a for tnightly first published in Barcelona in February of 1889 and for six years, until late 1895, functioned as the mouthpiece of the Propaganda Movement. Financed by contributions from the Comité de Propaganda, a Manila-based group, La Solidaridad put forth the demands of the Propaganda Movement, singling out the friars as major obstacles to meaningful reform. As the maiden issue put it, the movement’s aim was to “combat reaction … be receptive to liberal principles … and propagate democratic ideals.” The paper also printed news about events in the colony, and political views of leading Spanish politicians on the Philippines. The Propagandists had aims similar to that of a Madrid group, the Asociación Hispano-Filipino, founded on January 12, 1889, principally by a Spanish academic Miguel Morayta. However, the Propagandists, being younger, felt the Madrid group (made up of Españoles Filipinos, mostly retired Spaniards who had once lived in the Philippines) was too accommodating of the authorities. The Asociación did lobby successfully for the passage of some laws such as mandating the teaching of Spanish. Nevertheless, the Asociación and the Propagandists lobbied jointly for their common objectives, e. g., representation in the Cortes, the lifting of censorship of the press, and an end to the arbitrary deportation of colony residents with out due process. Three Filipino expatriates for med the heart of both the publication and the movement: Graciano López Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and José Rizal. All three wrote for La Solidaridad; Rizal, writing in the journal, addressed the Spanish government: “If you persist in your system of banishments, in carcerations, and assaults with out cause, if you punish them for your own faults, you make them despair, you remove their abhorrence for revolutions and turmoils, you harden them and you arouse them to struggle.” López Jaena was the editor for its first eight months, before handing over the editorial reins to del Pilar. Back in the islands, López Jaena had penned a satire whose principal character was a Fray (or Friar) Botod. Botod in López Jaena’s native Hiligaynon—a major Visayan language—means full-bellied and was a none-too-subtle reference to the corpulent lifestyle and avarice of the friars. The work pilloried all the shortcomings of the Spanish clergy. Even though the tale circulated only in zamizdat form, its notoriety drew unfavorable clerical at tention, prompting in López Jaena a sudden and in tense curiosity about life in Spain. He had a reputation as a skillful or ator and for having contacts among Spanish liberals and Masons, most if not all of whom were anti-clerical. Unfortunately, López Jaena had a fondness for the bottle, hardly helpful to regularly putting out a publication. After a brief but disastrous visit to the islands, López Jaena returned to Spain. He had become a hack, at one point writing for a Spanish broadsheet that was critical of the Propagandists. He died, penniless and a consumptive, in Barcelona, at the age of forty. Del Pilar, a lawyer from the Tagalog province of Bulacan, whose brother, a secular priest, had been deported to the Marianas in the wake of the 1872 mutiny, and who wrote under the pseudonym of Plaridel, was the real force behind La Solidaridad, soliciting articles from various correspondents, raising funds, writing for the journal itself, and finally taking over the editorial reins from López Jaena. He had also published in 1882 the broadsheet Diariong Tagalog ( Tagalog Daily )—the first such publication in the islands. It lasted for only three months. He was an early defender of Rizal’s first novel, Noli Me Tangere. Due to his satirical pamphlets, written in Tagalog—unlike the works of Rizal, who wrote his novels in Spanish, a fact which meant a majority of Filipinos couldn’t read him (only five percent of the population was fluent in Spanish)—del Pilar was for ced to flee the colony in early 1889.

The Propaganda Movement, an outgrowth of the 1872 Mutiny, was a crusade carried out clandestinely in Manila and openly in Spain by scions from the expanding ranks of the native bourgeoisie. This movement, while directly a result of the killings of the three martyr priests, can be traced further back, according to the writer Nick Joaquin, to the waning years of the eighteenth century",

The Propaganda Movement had reformist rather than revolutionary goals. Among these were: recognition of the colony as a province of Spain; equal treatment of Filipinos; freedom of the press; curtailment of Guardia Civil abuses;",

After being acquitted in Paris of shooting his wife and mother-in-law fatally in a jealous rage—a case that provoked widespread scandal—Juan Luna returned to the colony in 1894. Shortly after the revolution against Spain broke out in August of 1896, Luna was implicated and imprisoned, only to be released in 1897. In 1899, he was named a member of a delegation to the United States by the Philippine revolutionary government, headed by Emilio Aguinaldo, to make a case for in dependence, but the painter died of a heart at tack in Hong Kong. J OSÉ R IZAL Born in 1861, José Rizal could converse in ten languages and corresponded in six. The most charismatic and well-known member of the Propaganda Movement, Rizal was also a medical doctor, scientist, fencer, and writer who brilliantly articulated the dreams and buried hurts fueling the newfound nationalism. His older brother, Paciano, had been a protégé of Fr. Burgos and had been living with the latter when he was implicated in the Cavite Mutiny. Paciano had described the grisly executions to the young José, eleven years old at the time, which undoubtedly helped shape his later views. Rizal would write the staff of La Solidaridad: “Without 1872 there would now be neither Plaridel nor Jaena nor Sancianco, nor the valiant and generous Filipino expatriates in Europe. Without 1872, Rizal would have been a Jesuit and in stead of writing the Noli Me Tangere, would in stead have written something entirely different.” Coming from an upper middle-class family in Calamba Town in Laguna Province, not far from Manila, and whose patriarch, Francisco Mercado, was an in quilino who farmed large tracts of friar land, José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso was a precocious child, the favorite of his mother Teodora Alonso, a sophisticated and devout woman who believed in the virtues of a good education and taught the young boy to read and write even before he started his for mal schooling. A prodigious and disciplined learner, Rizal easily shone in the lower grades and, with nothing more to learn in the local schools, was sent to Manila at the age of eleven, to continue his studies, first, at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Manila and, later, at the Dominican University of Santo Tomás. He moved to the city as José Rizal, “Rizal” being a second surname, and a variant of the Spanish ricial, meaning pasture land. His family feared that if he bore the patronym of Mercado, he would be linked to his older brother Paciano and thus in directly to Fr. Burgos. Higher education, in which he excelled, graduating summa cum laude from the Ateneo, and during which he was awarded literary prizes for his writing in Spanish, only fed his hunger for broader horizons, which he, along with his generation, knew were not available in the stultifying at mosphere of a conservative dispensation that looked down on Indios. At the age of twenty-one, in 1882, he sought those horizons in Europe. He quickly became part of the Filipino community of students, in tellectuals, and political exiles in Spain, and was soon one of the leaders of the Propaganda Movement. Rizal published his first novel, the Spanish-language Noli Me Tangere, in 1887. The novel is a powerful and searing in dictment of corruption and abuse in the colony, particularly among the friar or ders who epitomized to the novelist as they did to most Filipinos the venality, moral blindness, and arrogance of colonial rule. The novel was banned in the colony—having a copy was grounds for being charged with subversion—but circulated clandestinely. The author returned to Manila for a visit in 1888, one cut short when his family, fearful for his safety, persuaded him to leave. By then, Rizal had acquired something of a rock star’s popularity, of ten followed by crowds when he was seen in public, deepening the distrust the authorities had of this ilustrado. Returning to Europe, after watching Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show in Paris in 1889, Rizal and his companions were impressed by the dignity and agility of the American Indian performers. They decided, part in jest, part in all seriousness, to call the mselves “Los Indios Bravos,” claiming a term the colonizer meant disparagingly as a badge of honor, a way of empowering the mselves. In London, Rizal annotated Sucesos de Las Islas Filipinas, by Dr. Antonio de Morga, a 1609 Spanish account of pre-Hispanic culture, to show that a thriving sophisticated culture existed before the advent of the Spanish. He went on to write El Filibusterismo ( The Subversive ), a sequel to the Noli and published in 1891. Rizal felt the second novel was darker and more profound than the Noli. Dedicated to Gómez, Burgos, and Zamora, the Fili (as it is popularly known) concerns its wealthy protagonist, Simoun, disillusioned by the failed reforms he has championed, plotting a violent uprising, and recruiting young men to his cause. The plot fails, however, and the would-be revolutionary kills himself. Just as with the Noli, the second novel added fuel to the fire of friar hatred directed at Rizal, and was proscribed as well. La Liga Filipina and the Katipunan After his stay in London, during which he was made honorary president of La Solidaridad, Rizal decided to carry on the struggle for reforms back in the colony. He likened it to a doctor visiting the sick patient. He left Europe for good, and sailed for Hong Kong in October of 1891, where he waited to see how the political winds blew in Manila. In the British colony, he seriously explored the Utopian possibility of establishing a Filipino community in Sandakan, Borneo. He wanted to create a sanctuary for himself and his family, as well as the people of Calamba, his hometown, who had been dispossessed of their lands by the Dominican friars"

In the British colony, he seriously explored the Utopian possibility of establishing a Filipino community in Sandakan, Borneo. He wanted to create a sanctuary for himself and his family, as well as the people of Calamba, his hometown, who had been dispossessed of their lands by the Dominican friars. Even though the British North Borneo Charter Company was amenable to having these prospective immigrants settle on 5,000 acres of land, rent-free for three years, the financial costs in volved and the almost certain refusal of the Spanish colonial government to allow such a move in the end doomed Rizal’s endeavor to have the country come to him rather than he to the country. He decided to proceed to Manila by late June of 1892. Barely a week after his arrival he founded La Liga Filipina, its aim to disseminate the Propaganda Movement’s call for reformist, nonviolent ideals. Among other goals, La Liga Filipina advocated the unification of the archipelago into a political and cultural whole; development of agriculture, education and in dustry; and the eradication of in justice. Though these were hardly radical aims, the existence of the league provided the excuse his powerful enemies had been waiting for, and they complained to Governor General Despujol. On his or ders, Rizal was arrested just four days after La Liga’s in itial meeting. The government exiled him to Dapitan, a coastal town and Jesuit mission in northwest Mindanao and far from Manila. His enforced departure from Manila on July 15, 1892, effectively ended the reformist movement. Rizal’s four years in exile turned out to be some of the most peaceful in his life. In Dapitan, he set up a water system, a school for boys, and an eye clinic as well, where he treated the residents of the town for free. In the square fronting the town church, he constructed an earthen relief map of Mindanao. It was in Dapitan where he met the young Josephine Bracken, an Irish-Chinese mestiza who had accompanied her stepfather from Hong Kong to Dapitan so the latter could be operated on by Rizal, whose fame as an ophtalmologist had spread beyond national boundaries. Bracken would be his lover and companion in this last period of his life. O N THE E VE OF THE R EVOLUTION This last decade of the nineteenth century is unprecedented. Chaos, social upheaval, disease, hunger, and senseless deaths, but also hopes, dreams, a sudden sense of new direction—birth pangs of a nascent nation, death throes of an all but extinct for mal colonial or der. On the global stage, an aging empire is dying, and a new one is about to rise from its ashes. In that age of turbulence, life goes on for the Filipino, but now he begins to imagine himself in terms of a national identity, and regardless has a storehouse of customs—but customs that reflect an improvisatory sense, the different facets, the different streams, of life in the Philippines at the time, blending then as now the in digenous and the for eign, the alien and the familiar, in a word, “Filipinizing” them. In 1894 the population of the colony was estimated, based on parish registration, to be between 6 million and 7 million. To these need to be added about a million non-Christians, such as the in digenous tribes of the in terior, the Chinese, the Mindanao Muslims, and for eigners residing in the colony. The 1894 tally also counted 2,751 religious and lay clergy, and 21,513 military personnel. Of the latter, fewer than three thousand were Spanish; the rest were native conscripts. By the close of the century the peninsulares were believed to number approximately twenty thousand. If the native had changed, if his or her way of life had been altered, not so the apparatus of colonial administration. The governor general was of course the top of the heap, with two advisory bodies: the Junta de Autoridades, or Board of Authorities, and the Consejo de Administracíon, or Council of Administration. Additionally, there were four types of regional governments: civil; politico- military provinces; politico-military commands; and district commands. There were also the ayuntamientos. In modern parlance these would be metropolitan districts, of which there were eight, Manila being the oldest and largest. Governing an ayuntamiento were two alcaldes en or dinario, elected by Spanish residents; a city council; an alguacil, in charge of peace and or der; and a scrivener, responsible for record keeping and answerable to the governor general and alcalde mayor, or governor of the province. Then came the municipalities, or to wnships, made up of cabecerias de barangay, an agglomeration of barangays, each consisting of forty to fifty families and headed by a cabeza de barangay, or barangay chief. The latter had traditionally been drawn from the ranks of pre-Hispanic datu families but over time were appointed on the recommendation of the municipal government. The gobernadorcillo, or mayor, along with the cabezas de barangay and landowners, made up the principalia. As it is, the feudal system, with all its exploitative features, championed avidly both by the Spanish colonial authorities (except for the occasional liberal governor general) and the religious, remained in tact, essentially unchanged since the conquest that began in the late sixteenth century. Despite reform laws passed in the home country, the colonial administrators could basically pick and choose which features to implement in the islands. An in structive example was the liberalizing measure provided by the Becerra Law of 1889, which provided for the establishment of more ayuntamientos wherever there was civil government. At that time, there were eighteen provinces with a purely civil government, but the then-governor general Valeriano Weyler (1888-91) believed that only in seven of these provinces were there sufficient personnel qualified to carry out the tasks of civil government"

At that time, there were eighteen provinces with a purely civil government, but the then-governor general Valeriano Weyler (1888-91) believed that only in seven of these provinces were there sufficient personnel qualified to carry out the tasks of civil government. Moreover, rather than allowing elections so representatives could be chosen—as provided by the law—Weyler appointed in dividuals he deemed capable (and loyal both to him and to colonial strictures) to these positions. Thus, the very in tent of the law, of providing an opportunity for the locals to acquire exposure and training in self-government no matter how limited, was thwarted. In contrast, Puerto Rico already had some form of elections while Cuba had the status of an assimilated province. Before the outbreak of the Spanish- American War of 1898, there were already two major political parties in Puerto Rico, the Incondicionales, or Spanish party, and the nativist Autonomist Party. Months before the 1898 war began, the Autonomists won island elections. Thus, the Puerto Ricans enjoyed a certain degree of self-government, but still within the protective embrace of Madrid. In contrast, in the Philippines, any putative at tempts at reform and eventual self-government were stifled, mostly at the behest of the almighty friar or ders that had in essence become the state. Only when the Philippine Revolution of 1896 began were there half-hearted efforts to ward democratic reform, and by then, of course, these were meaningless. Nor had colonial rule meant a significant transformation of the colony from being mainly a source of raw material to one where in dustrialization took firm root. What the Spanish focused on throughout colonial occupation was extraction of whatever was of value in the islands, whether these were precious metals or spices or to bacco, to be sold or traded. As well, the Spanish viewed the islands as a trading conduit in Asia, particularly with regard to China. Even with the in troduction of agricultural machinery and cash crops, the emphasis continued to be trade for short-term purposes rather any far-reaching in dustrialization. Essentially, the Spaniards made most of their for tunes in the Philippines from an extractive economy, to the clear detriment of the local population. It was after all what they had done in their New World colonies, whose immense wealth of raw material—gold and silver—lulled the Spanish into avoiding the path of in dustrialization, and thus were outstripped in this by the Netherlands and Great Britain. In terms of the religious sphere, to wards the end of Spanish occupation, the archipelago was divided into five dioceses: one metropolitan area, Manila, and four suffragan, or subordinate, bishoprics: Nueva Segovia (Vigan), Nueva Caceres (Bicol), Cebu, and Jaro. Each diocese was supposed to oversee the activities of both regular and secular clergies active within its jurisdiction, but time and again the friar or ders, as has been previously described, were well aware of their in dispensable role in colonial government and resisted the right of diocesan visitation—perhaps the most obvious symbol of civil oversight. The regular or ders in the islands were made up of the friaries (the Augustinians, Recollects, Franciscans, and the Dominicans) as well as the Jesuits. The immense wealth the religious or ders accumulated was strikingly evident in their landholdings at the end of the Spanish colonial era. The friars owned almost 400,000 acres, or about one-fifteenth of cultivated land. In Manila and outlying districts, lands owned by the religious to taled more than 110,000 acres. The largest friar hacienda, run by the Dominicans, was in Calamba (where José Rizal’s parents were in quilinos) with 35,000 acres. While the European Propagandists soldiered on in Spain, the government turned a deaf ear to their efforts, though in dividual public of ficials were sympathetic. The fact that the once mighty Spanish empire was now reduced to small island colonies only strengthened the resolve of the Spanish ultranationalists to hold on to the remnants. Consequently, the authority of the Spanish friars in the Philippines was rendered well-nigh impregnable, as they were seen as the main bulwark against nationalist feelings. With the friars as parish priests, the Archbishop of Manila had little to no canonical authority over them. He was for ced to consult the provincials of the four friar or ders on all matters pertaining to the church, thus guaranteeing the depth and continuation of friar in fluence on Philippine society. One of the Liga’s members was a young working-class firebrand and Tondo warehouse worker by the name of Andrés Bonifacio, who revered Rizal. At first Bonifacio worked actively on behalf of the Liga, recruiting members.

The ideals of the French Revolution, in particular, seemed to have in spired him to think along mass mobilization and the resort to arms. He had read del Pilar’s satires, and it was the satirist who seemed to have in fluenced Bonifacio ideologically, for the hard-hitting writer was not averse to armed revolution. Bonifacio, along with the new recruits, consequently shifted the or ientation of the mass movement to wards complete in dependence from Spain. He founded in 1892 the secret revolutionary society dedicated to overthrowing the colonial yoke: Ang Kataastaasang Kagalagalangan Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan — the Highest, Most Honorable Society of the Country’s Sons and Daughters, the KKK, or simply the Katipunan. It would be the explosive catalyst that would end Iberian despotism, friar abuse, and establish a free state. Economic conditions exacerbated the social and political oppression suffered by the vast majority of the populace. There was a sizeable lumpenproletariat in Manila, made up of thousands of workers, drawn there (as to day) by the possibility of jobs, whether in the to bacco in dustry, in the port area, or in other factories that had sprung up due to in creased trade and demands for Philippine raw materials. In the countryside, the growing landlessness in creased the ranks of tenant farmers now working plots of land they had once owned but had had taken away from them by the manipulations of friar estates, unscrupulous landowners, and the rapidly rising class of Chinese mestizos. Landlessness of course prompted many to simply pack up and seek their for tune in the cities. The Katipunan didn’t lack for recruits. With many of its leaders members of Masonic lodges (Rizal himself was a Mason, with his Masonic name being Dimasalang, a Tagalog approximation of Noli Me Tangere ), would-be revolutionaries underwent in itiation rites that had a Masonic tinge. They were blindfolded and led to a dimly lit room that had a skull, a revolver, and a cutlass. If the applicant responded satisfactorily to questions put to him, he was then in itiated into the secret society by means of a blood compact. From an in cision in his arm, the in itiate drew blood to write his name. The in itiate also took on a new name—his nom de guerre. The newly in ducted member would in itially belong to the first of three Katipunan ranks, the Katipun. He could aspire to the next higher level, the Kawal (or Warrior), and the nce the highest, the Bayani (Hero). The Katipunan stressed brotherhood and ethical behavior. Many of its tenets clearly reflected the legacies of the Enlightenment and both the American and French revolutions: All men were equal and no one was superior to anyone else in terms of human dignity; the oppressed needed to be defended against the oppressor; and a man was great because he neither oppressed nor aided the oppressor and knew how to love and defend his country. Anticipating both the modernist feminist revolution and Mao Tse-Tung’s maxim that “women hold up half of heaven,” while also reflecting pre-Hispanic values, one tenet declared women to be partners, companions who shouldered equally the burdens of life. In the Katipunan’s Cartilla, or Primer, written by Emilio Jacinto—Bonifacio’s university-educated adviser who refused to give up the struggle even after Bonifacio’s execution by his soon-to-be-rival General Emilio Aguinaldo—the revolutionary society enjoined its members to “consider your wife not as a mere plaything, but as a partner, a companion in the hardships of life; be considerate to wards her weakness and think of the mother that cared for you in your childhood. What you would not want others do to your wife, daughter, and sister, do not do to the wife, daughter, and sister of another.” That the Katipunan explicitly referred to how women should be treated reflected the fact that the vital social role of women had enjoyed prior to colonial rule had continually been under assault by the aggressive patriarchal at titudes and values espoused by the Spanish, most in tensely and consistently by the religious or ders. These men of the cloth, reflecting the ultra-masculine ethos of Roman Catholicism by way of Inquisitorial Spain, saw the essentially egalitarian relationships between the sexes as aberrations, if not abominations. For women such as the babaylan to be the mediators between the visible world and that of the spirit; to be perceived as healers; to be called upon as a villager lay dying; for them to have as much right to sexual pleasure as men—all these female prerogatives were anathema to the friars, and a threat to their primacy. Male authority had to reign supreme, whether in matrimony, government, or religion. By the time of the 1896 Revolution, the “good” Filipina was a paragon of modesty, keeper of repressed longings, and unswervingly faithful to the men in her life, whether to the husband, son, or Christ on the cross. With the Katipunan, there was a deliberate effort to do away with the restrictions on women’s roles.

The Katipunan grew rapidly, and though Manila was rife with rumors about the existence of a revolutionary society, no hard evidence could be produced. Governor General Ramón Blanco consequently dismissed the reports as the paranoid musings of the friars. That hard evidence was supplied when a low- ranking disgruntled Katipunero Teodoro Patiño unburdened himself to his devoutly Catholic sister about plans for an armed uprising. The in for mation quickly reached the curate of the Tondo parish, Fr. Mariano Gil. The friar convinced Patiño (most likely under threat of excommunication), a typesetter at the newspaper, Diario de Manila, to lead him to the of fices and show him where papers and other paraphernalia pertaining to the Katipunan had been hidden. The untimely discovery for ced the Katipunan to proclaim the need for revolution on August 23, 1896 at a place called Pugad Lawin (Hawk’s Nest), at the home of Melchora Aquino, a self-taught eighty-four-year-old widow who fed, housed, and otherwise took care of the Katipuneros when fighting broke out. The grand dame of the revolution, she was known affectionately as Tandang Sora (Old Sora). Subsequently imprisoned by the Spanish and in terrogated as to Katipunan activities, the octogenarian wouldn’t talk. She was exiled to the Marianas and allowed to return once the United States of America had taken over the country. Still, she refused to pledge allegiance to the United States, and died in 1919 at the age of 107, with American colonial rule firmly in place. In the yard of her home, Bonifacio and his fellow Katipuneros tore up their cedulas, or tax ID certificates, in dicating a decisive split with Spain. (In 1884, a graduated poll tax, known as the cedula personal, was created to replace the age- old tribute. The cedula was proof of payment.) The revolution, in itially confined to the Tagalog provinces, quickly spread to other regions. Attacks against government buildings and garrisons occurred in places such as the Camarines provinces, Zambales, and, to the southwest, Palawan Island. Not surprisingly, Governor General Ramón Blanco proclaimed a state of war. Those suspected of being members of the Katipunan were imprisoned and to rtured, with many being put to death. Among the most notorious in stances of mass execution were two that took place on January 4 and 11, 1897—by then Blanco, perceived by the friars as in sufficiently hawk-like, had been replaced by Camilo Polavieja, a battle-tested veteran who rarely brooked compromise. The first group, consisting of fifteen men, was known as the Bicol Martyrs, after the southern Luzon region whence they hailed or iginally. Included were three secular Filipino clerics. The second group came to be called the Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan, after the site of their execution, now part of Rizal Park. These were men arrested after the Cry at Balintawak on charges of treason, and in cluded civic leaders, professionals, and members of the Katipunan. The most prominent victim of the regime was Dr. José Rizal. The previous year, Rizal had requested permission to act as a volunteer medic with Spanish for ces in Cuba, where revolutionary for ces under José Martí sought in dependence, a revolution that would provide the U. S. the needed pretext of declaring war on Spain. Acting on the suggestion of his Austrian friend and faithful correspondent Ferdinand Blumentritt, Rizal believed his petition would dispel the notion that he was disloyal to Mother Spain. Permission to sail to Cuba was granted in 1896, before the Revolution broke out. Rizal sailed to Manila and there, on September 3, shortly after the Revolution began, boarded a ship for Europe, with letters of recommendation from Governor Blanco. In one, addressed to the Spanish Minister of War, Blanco wrote that Rizal was “in my judgment, more deserving of pardon and benevolence since it appears that he is in no way in volved in the uprising.” Nevertheless, en route—by then the Revolution was in full throttle—on the or ders of the same Blanco, who was under pressure from Spanish military of ficers to bring the physician/novelist back, Rizal was arrested for his alleged role in the uprising. Once in Barcelona, after a short stay in Montjuich Prison, he was sent back to Manila under guard. After imprisonment at Fort Santiago, and a trial closed to the public, Rizal was found guilty of fomenting rebellion. The fact that one of the passwords used by Katipuneros was “Rizal” provided damning circumstantial evidence of his alleged complicity. The irony was that Rizal, while in exile at Dapitan, had been approached in early 1896 by Dr. Pio Valenzuela, an emissary of the Katipunan, seeking his advice and, more importantly, his imprimatur for the planned uprising. Though the protagonist Simoun in his second novel El Filibusterismo had argued that only violence could overthrow the Spanish regime, Rizal believed the country was not yet prepared for such a radical step, that it would only result in the tragic loss of in nocent lives. He in for med Valenzuela that he would not be a party to the impending revolution. Like other members of the Propaganda Movement, he saw evolutionary reform as the gradual but sure way to in dependence. In his stress on nonviolence, Rizal anticipated Gandhi’s policy of passive resistance that proved effective in securing in dependence for the Indian subcontinent. As seen in an iconic photograph of the execution (taken by the Spanish Creole photographer Manuel Arias Rodriguez, whose photo documentation of the conflict between Filipinos and the Spanish is in valuable), at dawn of December 30, 1896, clad in a morning coat and a black bowler hat, Rizal was executed by firing squad at the Luneta. Behind the firing squad made up of Filipinos were Spanish riflemen, ready to gun down the Indios should they refuse to fire.

Upon being hit, eyewitnesses said he managed to twist his body around and fall as he had wanted to: face up. In a possibly apocryphal version of his death—and a testament to how potent a symbol his martyrdom had immediately become—the more moved of the on lookers rushed for ward to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood, now considered sacred. Unbeknownst to his jailers, the day before his execution, Rizal had managed to conceal a document in an alcohol stove he gave to his sister, whispering to her in English that he had something hidden in it. The document turned out to be a poem, Mi Ultimo Adios ( My Last Farewell ), a moving and eloquent record of his thoughts about his country—as well as his love for Josephine Bracken. (Bracken joined the revolutionary army briefly but left the country for Hong Kong in May of 1897.) The poem quickly became famous, its opening line known to every school child in the country: “Adios patria adorada, region del sol querida” (“Farewell, beloved country, land cherished by the sun”). * Aware of how scarce his manpower resources were and how the Cuban Revolution was drawing in more Spanish troops, and with the possibility of native soldiers joining their brother Filipinos in open revolt, Blanco requested a thousand soldiers from Spain and permission to form militias of volunteers drawn from the Spanish community in the colony. Surprisingly more aware of the need for a surge in troops, Madrid sent approximately double the number of soldiers requested. Towards the close of 1896, a little more than two thousand troops disembarked at Manila, almost at the same time as the arrival of Blanco’s successor, Camilo Polavieja. The reinforcements were welcomed as saviors by the Spanish community and by civil and religious authorities in festive, even giddy, rites. In a welcoming speech, the president of the Casino Español, the preeminent Spanish club in Manila, spewed vitriol on the Indio revolutionaries: “You arrive in time; the cannibals of the for est are still there; the wild beast hides in his lair; the hour has come to finish with the savages…. Destroy! Kill! Do not pardon.” Despite the in crease in troop strength, it was too little too late. The repressive measures only stoked the fire of rebellion. To the long-suffering populace, such measures were harsher only by degrees and not substantially different from what they faced in pre-revolutionary times. They were up to the task of enduring whatever the Spanish could throw at them. Too, where ethnic and regional rivalries divided them in the past, now they began to have a sense, even if tenuous, of a collective whole. By the end of the year, the fire of revolution engulfed the country. And while the revolution had still to coalesce effectively, nonetheless it would only be a matter of time before it did. Bonifacio versus Aguinaldo On the ground, Bonifacio, though an in spirational figure, proved to be in effective as a military strategist, his for ces’ at tacks on to wns and garrisons ill- planned and ill-fated. As the revolution blundered on, Boni facio’s reputation diminished almost in reverse proportion as that of another member of the Katipunan, Emilio Aguinaldo, was on the rise. Inducted by Bonifacio into the Katipunan, Aguinaldo was the gobenadorcillo of Kawit Town, in nearby Cavite Province (the same province where the 1872 Mutiny had taken place). Under Aguinaldo’s leadership, the Cavite rebels scored victories against the Spanish. After the in itial successes of the Katipunan in Cavite, Governor General Polavieja, having taken over from Blanco, mounted a counteroffensive that regained ground. The two main factions of the Katipunan in the province— Magdalo, under Aguinaldo, and Magdiwang, pro-Bonifacio—agreed to meet. Bonifacio and some of his staff traveled to the town of Tejeros, where elections were held to determine who should lead the revolution. Along the way, many on lookers hailed Bonifacio as the “King of the Tagalogs,” a testament to his popularity. By this time, however, it was clear to everyone that Aguinaldo was far superior as a military strategist than the Supremo. The added fact that the elections were being held in Cavite, Aguinaldo’s home turf, meant the gathering was dominated by pro-Aguinaldo members. Unsurprisingly, Aguinaldo won the election, while Bonifacio was elected as Minister of Interior, more of a ceremonial of fice. Outmaneuvered and provoked by questions of his competence, and nearly coming to blows with his in terlocutors, Bonifacio, asserting his authority as founder and head of the Katipunan, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Tejeros Convention and stormed out of the hall. Aguinaldo was sworn in as president of the revolutionary government shortly after; his Cabinet took shape, all its members from Cavite, a fact that spoke to how regionalism played a role in Aguinaldo’s consolidation of power. (This would have been obvious to Bonifacio but which he ignored, probably banking on his stature as founder of the Katipunan to outweigh everything else.) The lone exception was General Artemio Ricarte, who hailed from the Ilocos region up north but was now a permanent resident of the province. Bonifacio and his followers continued to oppose the Aguinaldo government even though they were at a disadvantage, not being from the province and the refore having little support there. Even the supposedly pro-Bonifacio Magdiwang wing threw its support behind Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo had him arrested, and the founder of the Katipunan and his brother Procopio were brought to trial before a military court supervised by their now-sworn enemies.

The two were quickly found guilty of sedition and treason. On May 10, 1897, the Bonifacio brothers were executed in the woods of Mt. Buntis. The Supremo’s widow, Gregoria de Jesus, evaded capture and returned to Manila, where she married Julio Nakpil, a Katipunan of ficer loyal to Bonifacio and active in the revolution against Spain. She resumed revolutionary activities, principally deciphering messages sent in code by members of the Katipunan in the field. She also knew how to ride and use firearms, and took part in a number of encounters. The leadership was now firmly in the hands of propertied men, members of the principalia, rather than the working-class for ces that Bonifacio had represented. Would this change the direction of the armed struggle against Spain? Not in the short term, but as the drive for in dependence from a Spain determined to hold on to the vestiges of its once grand empire proved to be complicated, it finally did veer to wards compromise. As Renato Constantino puts it in his A Past Revisited, “There was only one logical outcome of the triumph of the elite. Leading the Revolution meant leading it to suit the desires of those who had in terests to defend. Such a leadership could of fer only a vacillating at titude to wards the enemy.” One Revolution, Two Wars Undisputed as the leader of the revolution, Aguinaldo and his for ces retreated south to Batangas Province, as the Spanish counter-at tacks reclaimed territory. They then moved to Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan Province, north of Manila, where a constitution, based on the Cuban Constitution of Jimaguayu, was drawn up on November 2, 1897, for the republic that had been founded earlier that April, in Cavite province. A little more than a month after, however, through the mediation of Pedro Paterno (author of Sampaguita and Ninay ), both sides in the conflict negotiated to try to end the conflict. By December 15, 1897, the Treaty of Biak-na-Bato was signed between the Spanish colonial government and Aguinaldo. Under the Treaty, Aguinaldo and his cabinet agreed to go into exile upon being in demnified $400,000: $200,000 to the revolutionary army, and $200,000 more when the surrendered arms reached an agreed-upon to tal. An additional $900,000 would be used to compensate non-combatant Filipino families who had suffered losses during the fighting. Aguinaldo and several of his closest associates sailed for Hong Kong on December 27, 1897, where the in demnity was deposited in banks. According to some sources, the general’s in tent was to use the funds to purchase war materiel and continue the fight against Spain. But his detractors held that time and the odds favored the revolutionary for ces, creating considerable suspicion that the treaty was essentially a sell-out. Be that as it may, it was an illusory peace, as the Spanish barely complied with the treaty’s terms, nor did the revolutionary for ces lay down their arms. Besides, the revolution could no longer be bound by the policies of Aguinaldo and his Cabinet. The genie had been let out of the bottle. Now there was a near- universal desire to be rid of Spanish rule. The fighting continued in Central and Northern Luzon, and in parts of the Visayas. But events moved fast. On February 15, 1898, the USS Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana. In a feverish exercise of yellow journalism, the U. S. press stoked public outrage, and the United States used the Maine as a pretext to declare war on Spain in April. And so the stage was set for the rise of the United States as a global power and the beginning of what is of ten referred to as the American Century."

S. sympathized with the Cuban rebels and that it in tended to protect U. S. in terests in the Caribbean island. The ship was blown up on February 15, 1898, while at anchor off Havana, killing 266 men. At the time the cause was unknown—though an in vestigation in 1976 by Admiral Hyman Rickover of the U. S. Navy determined that the explosion was an accident, caused by a faulty coal bunker—but U. S. newspapers immediately blamed the Spanish. The rallying cry for the moment was “Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!” William Randolph Hearst, owner and publisher of the New York Journal, famously said to Frederic Remington, the paper’s well-known illustrator, “You furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war!” And that Hearst and the media did. The explosion was the perfect excuse for a war, and even though Spain had of fered an immediate armistice and considerable autonomy for the Cubans, the Mc Kinley government was undeterred from its mission, declaring war on April 25. The conflict was just the right opportunity for a young giant, eager to participate in the “Great Game” of empire building. It heralded the beginning of what has since come to be known as the American Century. Even before the for mal declaration of hostilities, Theodore Roosevelt, Undersecretary of the Navy—filling in for Secretary John D. Long, who was on leave—or dered U. S. warships under the command of Commodore George Dewey to Hong Kong in late February and there await battle or ders. Once at berth in Hong Kong, in anticipation of the war, Dewey requested troop reinforcements from Washington. With the declaration of war, he and his fleet steamed to Manila and on May 1, annihilated an aging Spanish fleet, with only one loss of life: an American sailor felled by heat stroke. The lopsided victory essentially sealed the fate of Spanish rule. It was an outcome easily predicted: the Spanish empire was on its last legs, plagued by a significant trade deficit and political in stability at home. American consular authorities had already contacted Aguinaldo in Singapore and led him to believe that the North American nation was coming to the revolution’s assistance and would engage the Spanish on behalf of what was hoped would soon be an in dependent country. Nothing was ever put in writing, however, leading to denials later on the part of the consular of ficials in volved. Aguinaldo followed shortly on May 19, brought back from Hong Kong to the islands by an American gunboat. Less than a week later, on May 24, 1898, he declared the establishment of a dictatorial government. It was to last until a Constitutional Assembly could be for med, a preliminary step in for ming a republic, with a president and a cabinet. At first, cordiality characterized relations between Aguinaldo and his Philippine revolutionary for ces and Dewey and his troops. A month after he arrived, on June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed from his home province of Cavite an in dependent Philippine republic. By then, Filipinos had defeated the Spanish in most of the archipelago and had ringed the Walled City—the king piece still in the hands of the Spanish but perilously close to being checkmated by Aguinaldo. Thus the stage was set for the subsequent and in evitable war between a fledgling nation—the first in Asia to raise the banner of revolution against a Western power—and a North American republic, itself founded on revolution and with a constitution that had served as a model and in spiration to others around the globe as well as to the Filipinos, its troops now set to deprive those same Filipinos of their right to freedom. In setting its sights on Spanish colonies in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the United States made it clear to the European powers that it would not be excluded in claiming its share of colonies so as to acquire markets and sources of raw materials. Overseas expansion was viewed by both U. S. politicians and entrepreneurs as a way out of the economic crisis that befell the U. S. in 1893. But taking over the for mer Spanish colony in Southeast Asia was not a for egone conclusion. France, Germany, England, and Japan showed proprietary as well as predatory in terest in the islands, having sent warships to Manila Bay, to the great annoyance of Commodore Dewey. However, the war that erupted in early 1899 between the United States and the fledgling Republic of the Philippines, and the in crease in U. S. troops, effectively curtailed for eign in terest, at least until the outbreak of World War II. The entry of the United States obviously complicated the picture, however. On one level, Spanish colonialism was being confronted by American imperialism, eager to administer the coup de grace to the old or der. On another level, the Philippine Revolution was once more under the leadership of Aguinaldo and his fellow principalia—a revolution that had only grown stronger and had the Spanish on the ropes. In an at tempt to delay the in evitable, the Spanish proposed the for mation of a consultative assembly to be made up of the elite, and to bestow on Aguinaldo the rank of brigadier general if he would join the Spanish army. Both of fers were refused. On the ground, Aguinaldo and his army consolidated their gains, capturing Spanish garrisons in quick succession and, by the beginning of July 1898, controlled virtually the entire colony, except for the capital, Manila, to which it laid siege, alongside, albeit uneasily, U. S. troops. In these early stages, the Filipinos were not averse to American protection, regardless of whether the rank and file viewed the North Americans as genuinely sympathetic with their goals as set out by the Katipunan. In the meantime, the United States for ces played for time until more troops arrived. By late July, twelve thousand troops were on hand, and the reafter more troops began to arrive regularly. Aguinaldo declared the in dependence of the Philippines on June 12— Commodore Dewey was in vited to the momentous occasion but he begged off, saying it was mail day—and for the first time, the Philippine flag was displayed and the national anthem sung"

Aguinaldo declared the in dependence of the Philippines on June 12— Commodore Dewey was in vited to the momentous occasion but he begged off, saying it was mail day—and for the first time, the Philippine flag was displayed and the national anthem sung. In a nod to the United States, still seen as an omnipotent ally, the declaration stated: “Under the protection of the mighty and humane North American Nation, we proclaim and solemnly declare, in the name and by authority of the in habitants of all these Philippine Islands, that they are and have the right to be free and in dependent; that they are released from all obedience to the crown of Spain; that every political tie between the two is and must be completely severed and annulled; and that, like all free and in dependent states, they have complete authority to make war, conclude peace, establish treaties of commerce, enter into alliance, regulate commerce, and execute all other acts and things that in dependent states have the right to do.” Aguinaldo then began appointing his first cabinet ministers, in preparation for the business of governing a full-blown republic. In these for mative months, Apolinario Mabini, a brilliant thirty-four-year-old lawyer of peasant or igins from the southern Tagalog province of Batangas, became Aguinaldo’s political adviser. Dubbed the Sublime Paralytic due to paralysis of the lower limbs, Mabini was carted by relays of men to Cavite. It wasn’t long before he was seen as the brains of the revolution, for his ability to navigate the complex fields of diplomacy and help create a government to suit the temper of the times. He drafted decrees for Aguinaldo and persuaded the latter to move from a dictatorship to a revolutionary government. By June 23, 1898, such an administration was for med, with Aguinaldo as president. Local governments were established, keeping in place the administrative structures set up by the Spanish. Mabini was a Freemason and a member of Rizal’s La Liga Filipina. Initially opposed to armed struggle, he believed in the advocacy of reforms and had been a correspondent for Marcelo H. del Pilar’s La Solidaridad in Barcelona, enabling its expatriate readers and the Spanish to know what was going on in Manila. He quickly realized that Spain, having resisted in stituting reforms agreed to under the Biak-na-Bato Treaty, would never acquiesce to handing over power; revolution was the only recourse. Envious of his closeness to Aguinaldo, and probably out of snobbery, other members of Aguinaldo’s cabinet spread the canard that Mabini’s paralysis was due to his having contracted syphilis, in an at tempt to besmirch his character. The Aguinaldo government disseminated in for mation about the emergent state through two publications: El Heraldo de la Revolucíon— later to be called Gaceta de Filipinas —and La Independencia, whose founder and editor was General Antonio Luna. These served as outlets for exhortatory articles and of ficial communiqués, as well as news articles; more importantly, the two papers presented a portrait of a legitimate, functioning government. Even though American for ces had been beefed up, Filipino troops controlled the major approaches to Intramuros and could have easily for ced its defenders to surrender by cutting off food and water supplies, but they held back. The Spanish, to whom surrendering to a people they had viewed for 333 years as in ferior and in capable of self-rule would have been an unbearable humiliation, cut a deal with the Americans. By early August General Fermin Jaudenes, in command of Intramuros’s defense, was in backroom negotiations with Dewey to arrange a mock battle for the Walled City in which the newcomers would win but in a way that saved face for the Spanish. After a sham battle on August 13, 1898, to preserve their honor, the Spanish garrison defending Intramuros yielded to the Westerners. The scripted battle went off as planned, though not with out six American and forty-nine Spanish casualties. The Yankees claimed Manila that same day and refused entry to Philippine troops, on the grounds that the Spanish were fearful of being killed en masse by vengeful Filipino soldiers. The actions of the U. S. military confirmed the worst fears of the Aguinaldo government: that the United States was out to claim the colony for itself. Now with Manila in the hands of the U. S., and Spain surrendering to the North Americans, erstwhile allies faced each other in an uneasy standoff. Seeking to nullify U. S. gains, Aguinaldo sought diplomatic recognition from for eign governments; it dispatched Felipé Agoncillo as its representative, first, to Washington, D. C., and then to Paris, where Spain and the United States met in October 1898 for a conference to for mally end the Spanish-American War, and to determine the conditions under which the victor would receive the spoils. Protesting that there was already in place a legitimate government, Agoncillo was ignored, and refused a place at the bargaining table. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was for mally signed, setting out these terms: Spain would relinquish Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Marianas (Guam). In return, the United States would in demnify Spain $20 million—or a little less than $3 per Filipino, the population of the archipelago then estimated at 7 million. The treaty also allowed the Spanish ten-year access to Philippine ports and goods for the purposes of trade. For the treaty to take effect, the United States Congress needed to ratify it, and its approval was by no means sure. A vote was scheduled for February 6, 1899.

The treaty also allowed the Spanish ten-year access to Philippine ports and goods for the purposes of trade. For the treaty to take effect, the United States Congress needed to ratify it, and its approval was by no means sure. A vote was scheduled for February 6, 1899. Spain agreed to hand over control of Las Islas Filipinas, as well as Guam and Puerto Rico, to the United States. The U. S. allowed Cuba its in dependence, but burdened it with the Platt Amendment, which provided that Cuba cede territory to the United States for use as military bases—Guantánamo, principally—and the right to in tervene in Cuba to preserve life, property, and liberty, essentially whenever Washington deemed such in tervention necessary. The amendment also barred Cuba from making a treaty with another nation, giving the U. S. effective control over its for eign affairs. Signed into law by President Mc Kinley in 1901, these provisions were in corporated into the Cuban Constitution, rendering the island nation a U. S. protectorate and guaranteeing U. S. imperial hegemony by in direct, rather than direct, means. (These provisions would later be repealed by the Cubans in 1934.) A Lull on the Battlefield Determined to assert control, in September of 1898 Aguinaldo had moved the provisional government to Malolos, Bulacan, a province bordering Manila to the north. There he convened a congress—the consultative body Mabini had proposed—at the hoary Barasoain Church. There trooped eight-five representatives (mostly men of property) from provinces controlled by the Aguinaldo government. They set about drafting a Constitution, though this was essentially entrusted to one delegate, Felipé Calderón. Drawing from the constitutions of several South American countries as well as that of the United States, Calderón wrote a draft that proposed a unicameral legislature, and made the National Assembly, essentially the legislature, the dominant branch of government. The rationale, with which most of the Congress agreed, was that the Spanish colonial regime had been marked by an overbearing and tyrannical chief executive, the Governor General. It was hoped that the elevation of the National Assembly as preeminent branch, to be made up of elected representatives, would avoid this pitfall. Mabini opposed the adoption of a constitution. To him, the Malolos Congress was an in terim body, its raison d’etre to act as a consultant and propose policies to Aguinaldo’s revolutionary government, especially with regard to possible war with the United States, whom Mabini had from the outset mistrusted. Once a permanent government had come into being, a true constitution could be drawn up. How the Congress would act was determined in part by class. Mabini came from a peasant background, while Calderón and most others of the Congress were of the elite ilustrado class. Pressed on which course to take, Aguinaldo, himself a property owner and member of the principalia, decided to abide by the wishes of the Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Calderón-drafted Constitution. Most of its or iginal provisions were endorsed, except for one: an article that made Catholicism the of ficial religion of the state. In effect, this proposed article would retain what the Spanish had wrought—a devoutly Catholic state. This didn’t sit well with those in the Congress who harbored strong anti-clerical sentiments and many of whom certainly would have been Masons. After debates on the pros and cons of the provision, the Congress affirmed by only one vote the principle of separation of church and state. Written in Spanish, the document was adopted and the Philippine Republic in augurated on January 23, 1899. The Constitution acknowledged that sovereignty resided exclusively with the Filipino people. To Aguinaldo, the Malolos Constitution was “the most glorious expression of the noble aspirations of the Filipino people, a mirror of their culture, and a clear proof before the world of their capacity to govern the mselves.” Aside from the separation of church and state, its other notable provisions were setting up a system of free and compulsory education; a new fiscal and tax system; the foundation of a navy; a reorganized army; and the establishment of a diplomatic corps. Elected or not, the Malolos delegates were eager to show that they were capable of running the country with out outside help. By then, most of the Spanish for ces had sailed for Spain, except for a fifty- man garrison in the small town of Baler, in the province of Tayabas on the largely in accessible Pacific coast of northeastern Luzon. There for eleven months, from July 1, 1898 to June 2, 1899, the garrison held out in the town church—the only stone building in Baler—refusing to believe the revolution had succeeded, even when Spanish of ficials visited them. Finally, an article in a Madrid newspaper artfully left behind convinced the commanding of ficer of the truth, and the longest encounter between the Filipino for ces and the Spanish was over. The thirty survivors surrendered and were treated with respect by the Filipino troops. Back in Barcelona, the soldiers were given a hero’s welcome. (This event was the basis of a 1945 Spanish film, Los Ultimos de Filipinas, or The Last of the Philippines, a nostalgic valorization of patriotic duty and the defense of empire, very much in tune with the values of the Franco regime, already in place since 1939.)

And of course those centuries guaranteed an imprint of Hispanicization and a mestizo culture that had evolved and proved to be in eradicable, especially when it came to matters of faith. The United States and Spain agreed that Filipinos would be given religious freedom as well as civil rights but conditioned on approval of the U. S. Congress. President Mc Kinley appointed a commission, to be headed by Cornell University president Jacob G. Schurman, to proceed to the newly acquired colony and in vestigate conditions there. By the time the Schurman Commission arrived in Manila in March of 1899, however, the anticipated war between the United States and a newly minted Republic of the Philippines had been going on for a month. A S PLENDID L ITTLE W AR T URNS U GLY: T HE 1899 P HILIPPINE -A MERICAN W AR The deliberations and decisions of the Malolos Congress were ignored by the U. S. Less than two weeks after the in auguration of the Philippine Republic, and two days before the U. S. Congress was to vote on ratifying the Treaty of Paris and the takeover of the Philippines, hostilities between the fledgling government and the United States erupted. On February 4, 1899, two American soldiers, Willy Grayson and Orville Miller of the Nebraska Volunteers, shot and killed two Filipino soldiers. Grayson later said the Filipinos disregarded his warnings to halt and identify the mselves when they apparently wandered too close to American lines. After the two in fantrymen had killed them, Grayson shouted to his comrades-in-arms, “Line up, fellas. The niggers are in here all through these yards!” With the war conveniently being blamed on the Filipino for ces, and public war fever being stoked once more, the Treaty of Paris was ratified by the Senate, but by only one vote. The 1899 Philippine-American War (described by the United States government as a mere “in surrection”) was fierce, bloody, and long- drawn out, of ficially ending in 1902 but in fact continuing for a decade more. It far surpassed in ferocity, cost, and duration the Spanish-American War, which lasted all of four months, though it is this war that is remembered while its more costly 1899 sequel is not. With the U. S. military moving beyond Manila to conquer and colonize the rest of the country, the Philippine revolutionary army resisted fiercely but, lacking the weaponry, was outgunned. Only half of the estimated 80,000 Filipino soldiers had rifles, with the other half relying on bolos (machetes), spears, and homemade guns. Unopposed, Dewey cruised the Pasig River, lobbing 500- pound shells into Filipino for tifications, with predictable and deadly results. In conventional combat, not surprisingly, the Filipinos suffered disproportionate losses. The next day, February 5, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation in which he stated: “I know that war has always produced great losses; I know that the Philippine people have not yet recovered from past losses and are not in the condition to endure others. But I also know by experience how bitter is slavery, and by experience I know that we should sacrifice all on the altar of our honor and of the national in tegrity so unjustly at tacked.” More disheartening to those committed to the revolution were the ilustrado defections to the enemy in May, at tracted by of fers from the Schurman Commission for positions in the government being cobbled to gether. Cayetano Arellano, for in stance, was appointed to the Supreme Court in Manila. Another noteworthy defection was that of Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, a member of the ilustrado expatriate community in Europe, who founded La Democracia, a decidedly pro-American paper. Later on, de Tavera, along with other wealthy ilustrados who had supported the revolution against Spain, helped establish the Federalista Party, which in itially sought only statehood but changed that to gradual in dependence when the or iginal stance failed to at tract any significant public following. Such defections were not altogether surprising, as the ilustrados as a whole had always been reformists rather than revolutionaries; the United States, it seemed to them, would grant the reforms they had long and vainly sought from Spain. In April of 1900, the second Philippine Commission arrived, headed by William H. Taft, to put into place the Schurman Commission recommendations. Taking on legislative powers, the Taft Commission for mally set up colonial rule. Taft—a massive six-footer who weighed 340 pounds—persuaded de Tavera, and two other ilustrados, José Luzuriaga and Benito Legarda, Sr., to sit on the Commission, a seductive signal to the landed elite that they could have a hand in ruling the colony. The next year, Taft was named by President Mc Kinley as the first governor general of the islands, along with several Americans to serve in his cabinet.

S. soldiers fashioned an epithet just for the Filipino: “Gugu”—from gago, the Tagalog word for “stupid”—which more than half a century later would morph into “gook” to accommodate the Koreans and the Vietnamese. Soldiers on the march of ten sang these lyrics: Damn, damn the Filipino Pockmarked Khakiac ladrone [thief]! Underneath the starry flag Civilize him with a Krag And return us to our beloved home! Many of the U. S. of ficers were veterans of the genocidal campaigns against Native American nations, and in the Filipino enemy they discerned unmistakable likenesses. And so did Roosevelt: on the campaign trail for the vice-presidency of the United States, he likened the rebels to the Apaches and the Comanches. African-Americans serving in the U. S. expeditionary for ces were caught in a bind. On one hand, these Buffalo Soldiers—so-called for their bravery during U. S. wars against Native Americans—felt that they needed to show they were just as patriotic and courageous as the white soldiers. On the other hand, racial and social affinities between them and Filipinos were too obvious to be ignored, a fact brought home when white soldiers of ten called Filipinos “niggers.” Similar debates took place in African-American communities back in the United States. In Boston, black anti-imperialists adopted resolutions opposing the war. One such resolution declared: “Resolved, that while the rights of colored citizens in the South, sacredly guaranteed them by the amendment of the Constitution, are shamefully disregarded; and while the frequent lynching of Negroes who are denied a civilized trial are a reproach to the Republican government, the duty of the president and the country is to reform these crying domestic wrongs and not to at tempt the civilization of alien peoples by powder and shot.” Many black soldiers defected, the most celebrated (or in famous, depending on one’s perspective) being David Fagan. The twenty-four-year-old Fagan became an of ficer under the command of General José Alejandrino in Central Luzon. For two years, he proved to be a thorn in the side of his fellow Americans, so much so that his exploits became legendary, with an article in the New York Times characterizing him as a “cunning and highly skilled guerrilla of ficer who harassed and evaded large conventional American units.” The U. S. military of fered $600 for his capture, dead or alive. On December 5, 1901, a Tagalog hunter of fered U. S. of ficers the severed head of someone he claimed was Fagan. The identity was never confirmed, nor was there a record of reward money being paid. Fagan’s fate to this day remains shrouded in mystery. At a military disadvantage when confronting the U. S. military in open battle, the Philippine revolutionaries ceded ground, and Aguinaldo and his staff resorted to guerrilla warfare. The switch prompted the U. S. military to label this “uncivilized”—a charge refuted by Mabini, who pointed out that the Filipinos had no choice since they were poorly armed, that they had to continue to resist since their freedom was being threatened, and that “humiliating peace is to lerated only in uncivilized countries.” The war might have progressed differently if General Antonio Luna, Aguinaldo’s most capable field commander, had not been assassinated by Filipino soldiers in June of 1899. Luna was a wealthy ilustrado, and brother to the famous painter Juan Luna. Though Antonio had stayed on the sidelines in the 1898 revolution, shortly before the war broke out between the Philippines and the United States, he of fered his services to Aguinaldo and proved his mettle as a brave and savvy of ficer. He was soon heading Central Luzon military operations—the main the ater at this point in the war. However, Luna, notorious for his volatile temper and tart to ngue, in curred the wrath of several in fluential military of ficers. Even the normally unflappable Mabini complained of Luna’s mercurial disposition but knew that in this general he had an important ilustrado ally against accepting any compromise with the Americans, one who moreover declared impassionedly, whenever the occasion presented itself, his devotion to the goal of in dependence. Luna said that everywhere he went he asked the people if they wanted autonomy. According to him, their steadfast answer was: “Long live in dependence. May autonomy die!” On June 5, Luna—already falsely rumored to be contemplating a coup against the Supremo—rode to Cabanatuan, in the Central Luzon province of Nueva Ecija, in response to a note alleged to have been written by Aguinaldo in viting him to meet and discuss strategy. When Luna arrived, Aguinaldo was nowhere to be seen; Luna was stabbed and shot by soldiers from Aguinaldo’s hometown of Kawit—the same soldiers Luna had once vehemently upbraided for some breach of protocol and which censure still rankled. He was buried with full military honors, but his killers were never brought to justice. The War of Words In the meantime, the propaganda war was in full swing. The Schurman Commission stressed that the U. S. was on a mission civilatrice, to render the Filipinos “among the most civilized peoples of the world.” But setting aside its stated altruistic aims, U.

They pictured the mselves as reluctant colonizers impelled more by a Christian sense of duty than the desire for material gain. Conquest may have been painful, but was essential were the country to move for ward. President Mc Kinley’s famous peroration to a group of Protestant clergymen puts it rather melodramatically: When I next realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps I confess I did not know what to do with them…. I walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight; and I’m not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed the Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way—I don’t know how it was, but it came: … that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died. And then I went to bed, and went to sleep, and slept soundly, and the next morning I sent for the chief engineer of the War Department (our map maker), and I told him to put the Philippines on the map of the United States, and there they are, and there they will stay while I am president! Mc Kinley conveniently overlooked the fact that the islands had been Catholic for more than three hundred years. The need to “uplift and civilize” the Filipinos would be the theme in cessantly harped on every time U. S. imperialism was questioned. While self-serving, such justification was closely linked to the unshakeable belief in racial superiority that permeated the U. S. war effort—one that Rudyard Kipling endorsed. Kipling wrote his poem “White Man’s Burden” precisely to encourage the United States in its colonial endeavor (the poem’s subtitle is “The United States and the Philippines”): Take up the White Man’s Burden Send forth the best ye breed Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives’ needs To wait in heavy harness On fluttered folk and wild Your new-caught sullen peoples Half-devil and half-child … As the Americans envisioned it, colonial rule would be tutelary in in tent and benign in execution. Washington, after all, sought only “to spread peace and happiness … freedom … and self-government.” At a speech in Boston, Senator Alfred Beveridge had declared that the United States was “a conquering race…. we must obey our blood and occupy new markets and, if necessary, new lands.” Once the Spanish were vanquished, and the prospect of war with the Aguinaldo regime seemed imminent, the same senator thundered in Indianapolis, in response to the rhetorical question of ruling a people with out their consent: “Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, humane, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them?” In May, two months after it began its in vestigations, with most of its in for mation derived from a small number of the conservative elite, in cluding for mer members of the Malolos Congress eager for rapprochement with the United States, the commission recommended the appointment of a governor general who, like his Spanish predecessors, would be the paramount ruler. There would be an advisory group and an in dependent judiciary. Most importantly, the commission not surprisingly ratified the view that Filipinos were unfit for self- government, that the country was simply a “collection of tribes,” and that the refore it was imperative for Americans to stay on and impart the lessons of democracy. Enough members of the Malolos Congress favored accepting the Schurman of fer, which would have rendered the islands an American protectorate. They requested Aguinaldo to dissolve the Mabini Cabinet and form a new one that could secure a peaceful arrangement with the American for ces and the government they had been setting up. Instead, Mabini proposed an armistice that General Otis rejected, believing that the “in surrection” would collapse easily. Mabini then issued a statement urging the people to continue the struggle. Mabini was eventually captured by the Americans in late December of 1899. Refusing to pledge allegiance to the United States, he was exiled to the Marianas. His fragile health worsening in the unfamiliar setting, he finally agreed to take the oath of allegiance to the United States in early 1903, and thus was allowed to return to the Philippines, where he died in May. Negotiations on autonomy broke down, and the war continued. In the meantime, the Aguinaldo government kept an eye out for political developments in the U. S. that might mean favorable concessions for the Philippines. The November presidential elections of 1900 between Mc Kinley and William Jennings Bryan were seen as an opportunity for the anti-imperialist for ces in the U. S. to win, but Bryan was defeated. The war was still going badly for the Filipinos, for cing Aguinaldo and his staff to keep moving north, to the mountainous terrain of the Cordilleras. By November 1899, he and his army focused on defensive tactics. The Supremo was nearly caught at the mountain pass of Tirad, in Ilocos Sur, but General Gregorio del Pilar, commander of Aguinaldo’s rear guard of sixty riflemen, delayed the 900 American troops at the cost of his own life, enabling Aguinaldo to escape. Dead at the age of twenty-four, his body left to lie on the rocky soil, stripped of most of his clothing and decorations by the victorious soldiers, del Pilar was the nephew of the Propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar and the youngest general in Aguinaldo’s army, earning him the sobriquet of the Boy General.

Aguinaldo and his men finally found refuge in the mountain stronghold of Palanan, Isabela Province, on the remote rocky northeastern coast of Luzon. At the outset, General Elwood Otis assured Washington that the war would be over in a few weeks, especially after his for ces had taken Malolos, yet he kept requesting more troops as the weeks turned into months. Gaining ground was easy enough, but it didn’t take long for the U. S. command to realize they were in danger of stretching their for ces too thinly as they struck deeper into the countryside, where it proved harder to defend the mselves against guerrilla at tacks. Instead of set engagements, the Filipino guerrillas could choose the time and place for ambushes and didn’t require the logistical support the Yankee soldiers did, for the simple reason that the Filipinos could and did rely on the local population for their supplies as well as hide among them in plain sight. Too, the locals resisted providing in for mation that would have aided the in vaders. The Aguinaldo government had the support of the masses, overwhelmingly based outside the few urban areas and who, having borne the brunt of Spanish abuse, were not about to yield meekly to strangers who looked and behaved like their Spanish predecessors. T HE C ONDUCT OF THE W AR Early on, a General Shafter proved to be prescient regarding the way war had to be waged: “It may be necessary to kill half of the Filipinos in or der that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords.” The U. S. for ces grew in creasingly frustrated as they proved unable to in filtrate guerrilla networks and disrupt the workings of shadow governments. In to wns and villages, the Filipinos practiced what came to be derisively referred to by U. S. soldiers as “amigo warfare”— friend by day, foe by night. In areas that were considered “pacified”—under U. S. military control, and with a local government sympathetic or at least seemingly cooperative with the U. S.—the residents never outwardly resisted and of ten seemed to abet occupation but in reality constantly sought to undermine that same occupation, either by being actively in volved as guerrillas, or providing the guerrillas shelter and support, a majority of whom after all were friends and relatives. Such frustration on the part of the in vader, combined with a racist outlook on Filipinos—“half-devil, half-child”—provided the rationale for in discriminate warfare and to rture. In spite of press censorship, reports filtered back to the United States that detailed wartime at rocities, such as the burning of villages; the in discriminate killing of civilians; the execution of prisoners where a take-no-prisoner policy was in place; and the use of to rture. In an article for Harper’s Weekly, a correspondent by the name of John Bass described the in competence of Otis, the military tactics used as unsuitable to the tropical climate, and the obvious sympathy the locals had for the in surgents. He candidly observed that the “the sooner the people of the United States find out that the peoples of the Philippines do not wish to be governed by us, the better.” One major source of unfiltered in for mation were the letters soldiers wrote home to their families, recounting their horrific experiences. These graphic details would of ten land in the pages of hometown newspapers. From Anthony Michea, of the Third Artillery: “We bombarded a place called Malabon [a suburb of Manila], and then we went in and killed every native we met, men, women, and children.” And Charles R. Wyland, of Company C, Washington Volunteers, observed: “I have seen a shell from our artillery strike a bunch of Filipinos, and then they would go scattering through the air, legs, arms, heads, all disconnected. And such sights actually make our boys laugh and yell, ‘That shot was a peach.’” Two methods of dealing with amigo warfare were particularly harsh. The more sweeping one was the policy of hamletting, practiced by the Spanish in Cuba and known as reconcentrado, a technique that would be repeated during the Vietnam War more than half a century later. In early 1901, for example, the U. S. military herded the entire population of one island, Marinduque, into five concentration camps. But the most brutal example was perhaps the pacification of the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, and Tayabas (now Quezon) as directed by Major General Franklin Bell, who had earlier in troduced the residents of the Ilocos region to the benefits of reconcentration. Bell was determined to hunt down the hold-out General Malvar, who commanded five thousand guerrillas and effectively controlled local governments. In early December 1901, Bell had the population for cibly evacuated into designated centers or to wns that were transformed into virtual prison camps. The Filipinos were or dered to move into specified zones and to bring whatever they could of their property. Anything left behind would be subject to confiscation or destruction. This meant that the outlying villages and their adjacent farm fields were abandoned, the idea being to deprive the guerrillas civilian cover while at the same time keeping a close watch on the quarantined villagers who the mselves could be rebels. Locals had to demonstrate that they were “active” friends, e. g., providing in for mation to Bell’s for ces as to the whereabouts of the guerrillas. Curfews were put in place and boundaries set up outside each camp, with a no-man’s land beyond that—one that was termed morbidly a “zone of death,” for anyone caught in it after curfew was likely to get shot, no questions asked"

In this manner, the region was turned upside down and laid waste to, as abandoned villages were of ten put to the to rch—particularly if these were suspected of having harbored guerrillas—wells poisoned, and livestock either starved or killed. Ninety percent of the region’s carabaos, or water buffalos, perished, and rice production plummeted to just a fourth of its pre-reconcentrado levels. Unable to at tend to their fields, the huddled population suffered an in or dinate rate of death due to malnutrition and disease, such as dengue fever and malaria. In Batangas alone, 54,000 civilians died by the end of 1901. Overall, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people perished due to Bell’s iron- fisted rule. In April 1902, General Malvar surrendered to the U. S. for ces, his capitulation taken as a conclusive sign that the fighting was over, and that the remaining resisters were simply bandits and thieves, taking advantage of the war to practice their ancient trade under the guise of nationalism. On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the war, or “in surrection,” over. It wasn’t, of course. Enough revolutionary leaders continued the war of resistance, such as Generals Sakay, Ola, and Bulan. Similar tactics were exercised in the Visayan island of Samar. One town in particular provoked a scorched-earth policy from the commanding of ficer for the region, General Jacob Smith. Balangiga was a coastal town in the southern part of the island, where seventy-four U. S. troops were garrisoned. The troops routinely abused the to wnspeople, of ten for cing them into open-air holding pens even in rainy weather. This prompted clandestine plans for retaliation. On the morning of September 28, 1901, as the men were sitting down to breakfast, Filipino guerrillas, some of them disguised as women, burst into the mess hall and, armed mainly with bolos, at tacked. Both commanding of ficers were boloed to death, forty-six more were killed, and twenty-two seriously wounded. Only four escaped. Retaliation was swift and brutal. General Smith declared his in tention to turn the province into a “howling wilderness,” telling his men, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the more you will please me.” According to his in structions, anyone over ten was fair game. A food and trade blockade was in stituted, villages were burned, noncombatants were shot, and, as with General Bell’s policy, Filipinos had to actively show that they were friends; one surefire way of doing so was by turning in for mer. In 1902, General Smith was court-martialed and found guiltly. His punishment? An admonition and for ced retirement. * Just as brutal a retaliation visited on the in digenous population elsewhere was the 1906 massacre of 600 Moros—men, women, and children—at Bud Dajo, a dormant volcano on the island of Jolo off the southern coast of Mindanao. The in discriminate slaughter, presided over by General Leonard Wood, was a response to the killing of several U. S. soldiers a few days earlier. In Mindanao, in a six-month period, Moros had launched various assaults on American emplacements. Two hundred smaller engagements alone had also taken place in 1901. The war against the Moros was different since it had echoes of the religious Crusades against the Muslims in the Holy Land, whereas elsewhere in the archipelago the war was a secular affair, being against Filipinos who were the mselves fellow Christians, though the conduct of the war was decidedly un- Christian. One favored method of to rture, practiced on prisoners who were considered to be potential high-value in for mants, was the so-called “water-cure.” In this harsh method of in terrogation, the detainee was for ced to imbibe huge amounts of water, with soldiers pinioning his limbs, for cing open his mouth, and pouring water through a funnel. Sometimes water was for ced down a prisoner’s nostrils. Once the detainee was primed, he would be pummeled or kicked, the liquid being for cibly and painfully ejected. Though reluctant to give antiwar critics any ammunition, Governor Taft candidly stated before the U. S. Senate in 1902 that “there had been … in dividual in stances of water cure, that to rture that I believe in volves pouring water down the throat so that the man swells and gets the impression that he is going to be suffocated and then he tells what he knows.” Former Sergeant Leroy Hallock, who had witnessed the “cure” administered to at least a dozen in surgents, was more graphic: “They would swell up—their stomachs would swell up pretty large—and I have seen blood come from their mouth [sic] after they had been given a good deal of it.” This same Hallock testified to seeing one village of three to four thousand in habitants being to rched, and of knowing of at least half a dozen other such burnings. When the U. S. military was accused of perpetrating at rocities, a blanket denial was issued, or they were explained away by saying the harsh methods were justified on the grounds that these were necessary against a people who were less than human, and to whom the refore the common standards of humanity, or civilization, could not be applied. (It would be an argument repeated during the Korean and Vietnam wars.) In the case of General Smith, he was court-martialed and found guilty of in citing his troops to cruelties. He was punished with an admonition. An American congressman, who visited the Philippines and who preferred to remain anonymous, spoke frankly about the results of the pacification campaign"

(It would be an argument repeated during the Korean and Vietnam wars.) In the case of General Smith, he was court-martialed and found guilty of in citing his troops to cruelties. He was punished with an admonition. An American congressman, who visited the Philippines and who preferred to remain anonymous, spoke frankly about the results of the pacification campaign. “You never hear of any disturbances in Northern Luzon, because there isn’t anybody there to rebel…. Our soldiers took no prisoners, they kept no records; they simply swept the country and wherever and whenever they could get hold of a Filipino they killed.” General Elwood Otis proved to be in ept and was replaced by General Arthur Mc Arthur, who took over in May of 1900 and served until July 1, 1901. Mac Arthur was a veteran of the wars against Native Americans. Though he endorsed imperialist goals, he was a realist who knew that the Filipinos had no love for the Americans. He once said that it would take “ten years of bayonet treatment” to pacify the country. He realized that successful guerrilla warfare “depends upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population. That such unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of discussion; how it is brought about and maintained is not so plain. Intimidation has undoubtedly accomplished much to this end; but fear as the only motive is hardly sufficient to account for the united and apparently spontaneous action of several millions of people.” The war could have dragged on longer but luck helped shorten it when a certain Cecilio Segismundo, a courier from Aguinaldo, was captured by U. S. for ces. Segismundo was carrying dispatches to commanders in the field, one of which asked for more men for Aguinaldo’s mountain hideout. Under in terrogation Segismundo revealed the whereabouts of the revolutionary leader. A plan was for mulated to gain entry to his Palanan redoubt with out arousing suspicion. Five U. S. soldiers, headed by General Frederick Funston, would pretend to be prisoners of the Macabebes, mercenaries from Pampanga Province, disguised as Filipino troop reinforcements. Accompanying them were some Tagalog turncoats and a Spanish secret service agent, Lazaro Segovia. Forged documents purporting to be from one of Aguinaldo’s generals completed their disguise. Departing Manila by boat on February 6, they were brought to the desolate Pacific coast of northeastern Luzon and the nce trekked through rainforests and mountain passes until on March 23, 1901, they gained entry into the camp. Brought before the unsuspecting Aguinaldo, Funston and his men were able to capture the Supremo and his staff. Barely a week after, on April 1,1901, Aguinaldo pledged allegiance at Malacañang, where he had been detained, to the United States. Mac Arthur resigned that same day, with Major General Adna Romanza Chaffee, also a veteran of the wars against Native Americans, taking over. On April 19, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation for peace, which said in part: “The Philippines decidedly wishes peace: be it so. Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation…. I proclaim before all the world that I cannot remain deaf to the voice of a people yearning for peace nor to the lamentations of thousands of families who long for freedom of their loved ones, which is promised them through the magnanimity of the great American nation.” Although the head of the Philippine Republic did desire a free and in dependent country, he had in itially been too trustful of the United States, and ignored signs until it was too late that the North Americans in tended to stay. In the end, like most of the ilustrados, Aguinaldo sought compromise even as he and his men bore arms. Despite Aguinaldo’s pronouncement, the war of resistance continued. As a counterinsurgency tactic, the reconcentrado method was used mercilessly. In southern Luzon, Bell’s reconcentrado bore fruit: a weakened General Malvar, along with his men, surrendered in April of 1902. With Aguinaldo quiescent and Malvar captured, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the war over on July 4, 1902. Henceforth, revolutionary fighters would be classified as bandits and thieves. On June 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission passed the Reconcentration Camp Act, rendering of ficial what the military had been utilizing in the field. The Act authorized any provincial governor to reconcentrate in the to wns all residents of outlying barrios if “ladrones” or “outlaws” operated in these areas, the reby hoping to dry the rivers in which the guerrilla fish swam. Another prize catch for the U. S. for ces was General Macario Sakay. Sakay grew up in Tondo, where he had gotten to know Bonifacio. Joining the Katipunan in 1894, Sakay acted in popular Tagalog verse dramas, which were staged in different neighborhoods in Manila, thus providing the perfect cover for the young Katipunero to move about. Countering U. S. efforts to brand Filipino fighters as brigands, General Sakay, based in the mountains of the southern Tagalog region, declared himself president of the Philippines in 1903 and decreed that “anybody who contributes or gives aid and comfort to the government of the United States of America will be considered a traitor to this native land.” Continuing operations by U. S. troops for ced him to move and eventually he agreed to yield. Through an in termediary, Sakay’s conditions for his surrender—among them, general amnesty and permission to carry firearms—were accepted by the authorities. He and his followers came down from the mountains to Cavite on July 20, 1906—four years after the war was of ficially declared over—where they were in vited to a banquet at the governor’s residence. There, he and his followers were seized and disarmed, accused of crimes under the Brigandage Act and quickly brought to trial. Not surprisingly, he was found guilty, and he and an aide, Colonel Lucio de Vega, were in carcerated at Bilibid Prison in Manila, and hanged on Sept. 13, 1907. Before his death, the revolutionary general declared to the small crowd of witnesses (mostly prison guards and employees), “I want to tell you that we are not bandits and robbers, as the Americans have accused us, but members of the revolutionary force that defended our mother country the Philippines! Farewell! Long live the Republic and may our in dependence be born in the future! Farewell!

Farewell! Long live the Republic and may our in dependence be born in the future! Farewell! Long live the Philippines!” In the Visayas, a notable case was that of the self-proclaimed Pope of Negros Island, who was a thorn in the side of the U. S. military. Papa Isio, as he was called, was a charismatic peasant who led a band of remontados, the Pulajanes (the Scarlet Ones), and had joined for ces with the local elite in opposing the Spanish in the 1898 Revolution. Once war erupted between the Aguinaldo government and the United States, however, the local principalia signaled the U. S. that the island would gladly be a protectorate—a deal that Papa Isio and his followers rejected. The Pulajanes resisted both U. S. occupation and landlord collaboration, burning the haciendas of pro-American hacenderos. Motivated by economic desperation, the ragtag army fought U. S. troops bravely but in 1907, Isio, realizing the futility of armed struggle, gave himself up and was duly sentenced to death. The religious trappings of Papa Isio and his Pulajanes reflected a desire lodged deep in the psyche of the people, for a more active role in determining both the spiritual and material for ces that would guide their lives. Hence, his refusal to go along with the principalia leadership. This discordance between a populist stance and an elitist accommodation in fact marked both the revolution against Spain and the war with the Americans, albeit episodically, e. g., Bonifacio versus Aguinaldo, Mabini versus the Malolos Congress. Even if in directly, both strains sprung from the 1872 martyrdom of Gomez, Burgos and Zamora and the drive to Filipinize Catholic parishes—an aim that had acted as a spur to revolution. Not surprisingly, native priests sympathized with the revolution, even though the mostly Spanish Church had condemned it. The Emergence of an Independent Church Filipino priests had no quarrel with Catholicism itself. How could they, when they were believers in a country that, after more than three centuries, was solidly Catholic. Their quarrel was with the racialization of their ranks; a schism was in evitable. A secular priest from the Ilocos region, Fr. Gregorio Aglipay, thirty- eight years old and the only man of the cloth at the Malolos Congress, served as Military Vicar for Aguinaldo’s for ces. He supported the goals of the revolution and asked Filipino priests to do the same. He reasoned that with colonial ties to Spain severed, the patronato real was no longer in effect. It was time for Filipino priests to take control of the church in the country. Aglipay’s archbishop, Bernardino Nozaleda—clearly acting more as a loyal Spaniard than a Catholic priest—excommunicated him in January of 1899 even though Aglipay had made clear his in tent to remain loyal to the Vatican. On October 23, 1899, Aglipay, with the implicit endorsement of Mabini, who wished to see the establishment of a Filipinized church, still heeding the Vatican but working closely with, rather than against, the Philippine government, or ganized an ecclesiastical assembly in the province of Tarlac, in Central Luzon. The result was a provisional constitution for a nationalist Catholic church wherein for eign bishops could work in the island only with the approval of Filipino priests—clearly aimed at the Spanish ecclesiastical authorities used to calling the shots in the colony. Subsequent events, especially the war with the United States (in which Aglipay fought as a general) led to the founding of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (the Philippine Independent Church) in 1902, with Aglipay as its supreme head. Almost two decades later, the church counted a million and a half members, known as Aglipayans. Instrumental in the for mation of the new church was Isabelo de los Reyes, who was from Vigan in the Ilocos region. A distant relative of Rizal, de los Reyes was an activist who had been jailed by both the Spanish and the United States colonial administrations. At the age of twenty-four, by then a practicing journalist, in 1889 he published El Ilocano, the first such publication devoted entirely to a Philippine language other than Tagalog. He went on to become a distinguished folklorist who envisioned a nation that encompassed both the un- Hispanicized in digenous and Christianized groups—a nation that transcended ethnicity. Married thrice, the man was as in defatigable in his campaign for in dependence as he was in siring of fspring: he had twenty-eight children. The same year that the PIC was for med he or ganized the Union Obrera Democratica (UOD), the first labor union in the Philippines. The newly established church embodied one of the revolution’s goals: the displacement of the friar or ders by Filipino clergy. However, the PIC came into conflict with the U. S. regime over abandoned Roman Catholic churches it had taken over. The authorities sided with the Catholic Church by confirming its ownership of the churches. The separate question of what to do with the friars’ huge landed estates—approximately 400,000 acres—was resolved when the Philippine Commission in 1903 was authorized to purchase these.

The colony would serve as a huge economic stimulus package: its subjects would be a captive market for consumer goods turned out by an in dustrialized United States, with a capacity for production that demanded new markets. A countervailing force was the Anti-Imperialist League, founded in Boston on June 15, 1898. Its guiding principle was that no government was legitimate which did not have the free consent of the governed. The League spearheaded the anti-war movement, its public visibility owing mainly to its high-profile members, in cluding Mark Twain, the in dustrialist Andrew Carnegie, the president of Harvard University Charles Eliot, and Samuel Gompers, labor union leader and founder of the American Federation of Labor. In its platform the League stated: We earnestly condemn the policy of the present national administration in the Philippines. It seeks to extinguish the spirit of 1776 in those islands. We deplore the sacrifice of our soldiers and sailors, whose bravery deserves admiration even in an unjust war. We denounce the slaughter of the Filipinos as a needless horror…. We demand the immediate cessation of the war against liberty, begun by Spain and continued by us. We urge that Congress be promptly convened to announce to the Filipinos our purpose to concede to them the in dependence for which they have so long fought and which of right is the irs…. as greatly as we regret that the blood of Filipinos is on American hands, we more deeply resent the betrayal of American in stitutions at home. Between 1899 and 1902, the League distributed documents written by Filipinos. Among these were Emilio Aguinaldo’s “The True Version of the Philippine Revolution”; statements to U. S. Congress by Felipé Agoncillo, who had been unceremoniously shunned at the 1898 Treaty of Paris; and even a comparison of policies enumerated by Theodore Roosevelt and Apolinario Mabini. Later, after the war was declared of ficially over, the League would publish articles from Manila that were pro-in dependence. In addition, some League members wrote for new Filipino publications in the U. S., in cluding the first, the Filipino Students Magazine, founded in 1905. But opposition was not solely based on altruism. Many League members were in fact imperialists but believed the U. S. could expand with out the usual strong-arm tactics of the older empires. Andrew Carnegie, for in stance, felt the weight of U. S. capitalism would preempt such antiquated methods just by economic domination. There were those who opposed annexation for fear that Anglo-Saxon blood would be contaminated. Certain sectors of labor perceived immigrants as for ming a pool of cheap labor that would drive down wages, while agricultural enterprises feared the importation of duty-free agricultural products and the unfair competition this would generate. A middle way was espoused by the Philippine Progress League, also known as the Philippine Independence League. Less militant and hardly as popular as the AIL, the PPL proposed making the Philippines another Cuba—allowing it self-government but as a U. S. dependency. Though the pros and cons of U. S. conduct abroad was vigorously debated, it did nothing to stop the war. Might did make right, and the islands came under the dominion of the Stars and Stripes. As anticipated by the pro-annexation for ces, the Philippines became an important market for U. S. goods and in 1900 provided the base enabling the Mc Kinley administration to send U. S. troops to China to help put down the Boxer rebellion, an uprising of Chinese nationalists desirous of closing China to for eign capital and manufacture. Educating Big Brother Stoking the U. S. public’s patriotic fervor for this “civilizing” war were purported film documentaries that were in fact reenactments—obvious to to day’s film audiences but likely not to filmgoers then, since cinema was still in its early stages. Thomas Alva Edison’s studio made six newsreels about scenes from the war, in its West Orange lot in New Jersey. African-Americans stood in for Filipino soldiers, since Filipinos were routinely thought of as blacks. Inevitably, the reenactments ended with the white U. S. soldiers triumphant. These reels, amongst the earliest in stances of film as propaganda, thus helped reinforce pro- war sentiments, with its jingoistic emphasis on racial superiority, among the public. An effective tool in cultivating public sentiment favoring colonial-era philosophies that mixed so-called enlightened rule with the benefits of new markets and technology was the St. Louis World’s Fair. Opened in April and lasting to December of 1904, the fair was meant to commemorate the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. Sprawled across 1,200 acres and with more than 1,500 buildings, it was the largest of its kind in the world. Intended as a showcase of progress under U. S. rule, as well as to promote its global expansion both of trade and territory, the fair was a huge hit. And no other display was as popular as the Philippine Exhibit, which occupied 47 acres and constituted the fair’s largest. Approximately 1,100 Filipinos, of different ethnic groups, from Igorots to Visayans, from Mangyans to Moros, were brought over, presumably to educate the public but in reality served as freakish entertainment.

More than 400 Philippine Scouts and of ficers were on hand, to watch over their fellow Filipinos as well as to embody the new social or der—the triumph of light over darkness—that American colonial rule supposedly had brought to the islands. A disturbing aspect of the Philippine section was the consumption by Igorots of dogs. Traditionally this was done only on ritual occasions, but in St. Louis the Igorots were required to consume them daily, rendering meaningless a ritual act and adding another stereotype to the impressive roster already lodged in the Yankee mind. Other ethnicities were on display, too, from Native Americans— the latter were positioned just across the Philippine Exhibit—to Indians and Africans. The ethnocentric, racist display in St. Louis came seventeen years after a similar but smaller exhibition in Madrid, the Philippine Exposition of 1887. The centerpiece of that was an assemblage of island dwellings and about thirty Indios, a mix of Muslims and non-Christian tribespeople. The exhibition had been or ganized in part by the Manila-based Dominican Brother Pedro Payo, who in tended the display of Filipinos as proof positive that the colony was still largely “uncivilized” and demanded tutoring, particularly the religious kind. The reaction of the Madrid ilustrados anticipated that of the thoughtful observer in 1904: that the colonizer (in this case the Spanish) wished to strengthen rather than diminish the perception that the Filipinos were a backward and savage lot, thus justifying continuing dominion over them. Educating the Little Brown Brother Mass social and political movements in the islands during the American colonial period were subject to strict surveillance and militarization, impeding their growth and effectiveness. Both local politicians and U. S. colonial administrators, in their debates about self-rule, consciously and unconsciously kept the notion of in dependence from the U. S. alive in the public mind. The overt Filipinization of the colonial administration, though American control was very much in place, proved to be a powerful in centive to those who had always been ambivalent about armed resistance. President William Mc Kinley’s policy of Benevolent Assimilation was built on the premise that Filipinos would gradually be in corporated into the Pax and Via Americana through peaceful in doctrination in the principles of self-government and a cultural frame of mind distinctly Westernized and at tuned to the same cultural models as the United States. The idea was to encourage the “little brown brothers,” as Filipinos were blithely and patronizingly referred to, to emulate and identify with their bigger white brothers, thus transforming hostility into acceptance and, it was hoped, admiration. Mass education in English was undertaken early on, even when military rule was still in place, for both General Otis and General Mac Arthur viewed educating their colonial charges as an effective means of pacification. In 1901, the Second Philippine Commission, chaired by William H. Taft, performing legislative functions and supervising the establishment of local government, directed that free primary education in English be provided to the public and that Filipino teachers be trained to take over the duties borne by military men and U. S. civilian teachers, known as the Thomasites, after the USS Thomas, the for mer warship that had brought them over on August 21, 1901. That in itial group consisted of 509 young men and women, an evangelizing army eager to in doctrinate the school-boys and -girls of the islands in American ways and thus help heal the wounds of war by refashioning brown folk into the image of the colonizer. For that reason English would be the medium of in struction. A common language rendered identification much easier; it wouldn’t be too long before Filipino kids started to dream of snow, yearn for apples, and idolize fair- skinned Hollywood stars. On the practical side, English in struction would also ensure a steady supply of English-proficient civil and military personnel. The eagerness of the Thomasites to teach English to Filipinos stood in stark contrast to the Spanish who for the most part disdained to impart their language to the Indios. Education was the perfect tool for colonial administrators, as it embodied the tutelary basis of colonialism. Fred Atkinson, the first General Superintendent of Education in the Philippines, echoed that rationale when he talked about the U. S. mission in the islands: “The Filipino people … are children, and childlike, do not know what is best for them…. In the ideal spirit of preparing them for the work of governing the mselves finally, their American guardianship has begun.” In 1903, the colonial government set up a program for qualified Filipinos to be sent to the United States and there earn their university degrees. The idea was to produce trained people who would return and take over the tasks of civil administration. Called pensionados (literally, pensioners but here meaning those sent to boarding school), by 1912, over 200 men and women had received their higher-education degrees. The pensionados were usually drawn from middle- to upper-middle-class families, thus reinforcing class ties between the local elites and their U. S. patrons. With landlords, wealthy entrepreneurs, and the bourgeoisie favoring accommodation to U. S. rule, the only sectors of society that consistently opposed such rule were the working class and the peasantry. Gaining the least they despaired the most. On a parallel track, Taft in augurated a policy of “the Philippines for the Filipinos.” Fostering a kinship between the new colonizer and the Filipinos would, Taft believed, not only make Filipinos consumers of American products but also tamp down the fires of in surgent nationalism. Autonomy or even in dependence could then be sought, within rules set down by the United States. As long as the United States was in control, it could afford to put a kindlier face on military and civil repression"

Autonomy or even in dependence could then be sought, within rules set down by the United States. As long as the United States was in control, it could afford to put a kindlier face on military and civil repression. Such assimilationist tactics combined with free- trade policies would all but guarantee the Philippines would eventually become economically dependent on the United States while acting as a source of raw materials and expatriated profits—a tutelary endeavor that benefited the tutor more than the tutee. The year after Taft took of fice, in 1902, the Organic Act of the Philippine Islands was passed by U. S. Congress. The act set up a legal framework with a marked emphasis on a colonial economy that would facilitate the operation of U. S. businesses and in vestment enterprises. It also mandated the creation of the Philippine Assembly, subordinate to the Philippine Commission, and set up posts for two resident commissioners to the United States. There would be a clear separation of church and state—as had been called for in the Malolos Constitution. The advantage to the Roman Catholic Church was that this precluded government in tervention in appointments and the creation of parishes. The downside was that public aid ceased, and priests no longer had rights and privileges when it came to public affairs. T HE C AMPAIGN FOR I NDEPENDENCE Despite the virtues of democracy and freedom being trumpeted, the Sedition Law of 1901 prohibited the public manifestation of nationalistic feelings. Whether “or ally or by writing or printing,” the advocacy of in dependence was banned. Part of the reason was that the Philippine-American War was still raging outside of so-called “pacified” areas. In a famous case, the authorities arrested the playwright Aurelio Tolentino (a pioneer member of the Katipunan), accusing him of sedition and libel. His nationalist drama, Kahapon, Ngayon, at Bukas ( Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow ), had been staged in 1903 at a Manila the ater. In one scene, a character took down the American flag and trampled it, much to the anger of Americans in the audience. The the ater was subsequently shut down. Found guilty, Tolentino was imprisoned briefly. The playwright was unrepentant: until his death in 1915, he continued to write plays and poems that portrayed Uncle Sam as a villainous character. By late 1907—five years after the of ficial “Mission Accomplished” of 1902 —Governor General James Smith had in for med President Theodore Roosevelt that a complete peace now existed, even though there were still clashes between Muslims and American for ces in Mindanao. (That island was to remain under military rule until 1914, when Manila created the Department of Mindanao and Sulu as the local administrative body.) Elections had been held earlier on July 30, 1907, for the Philippine Assembly. Competing political parties could now openly and legally advocate for in dependence. Two young politicians came to dominate the Assembly and the local political scene until the outbreak of World War II: Sergio Osmeña from Cebu and Manuel L. Quezon, from Tayabas (now Quezon) Province. A Spanish mestizo, Quezon was a lieutenant in Aguinaldo’s army and had given up once the Supremo had issued his call to lay down arms. A Chinese mestizo, Osmeña was a journalist who supported the nationalist struggle. Both were appointed governors of their respective provinces, and their administrative capabilities and in particular their successful handling of local rebellions drew the at tention of the colonial establishment. Two parties campaigned for ascendance: the Nacionalistas, whose platform centered on immediate in dependence; and the Federalistas — one of whose founders was Pardo de Tavera—whose in itial goal was limited to statehood but later shifted to gradual in dependence. The voter base excluded the majority of Filipinos, being limited to those literate either in Spanish or English and with property valued at P 500, a substantial sum in those days. Out of a population of more than 7 million, only 104,966 were registered to vote, and only 98,251— less than 2 percent of the population—went to the polls. In effect, it was the elite voting the elite in. Standard bearers for the Nacionalistas were Quezon and Osmeña, both of whom won easily, with the latter getting the nod for Speaker of the Assembly. The Assembly was for mally in augurated on October 16, 1907, and came to be dominated by Nacionalistas. Constituting the lower branch of the legislative body of the colonial government—above it were the Commission and the governor general—the Philippine Assembly spearheaded the drive for in dependence. That too was the main task set by Quezon, as one of two Resident Commissioners to the United States Congress from 1909 to 1916. With the encouragement of Quezon, in 1913 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Francis Burton Harrison governor general of the islands. Harrison continued Taft’s “Philippines for Filipinos” under a policy known as “Filipinization.” Filipinos became the majority in the Philippine Commission, the reby ensuring full control of the legislative branch of the government. Harrison also appointed Filipinos to the judiciary and to important posts in the bureaucracy. Certain departments remained, however, under direct U. S. control, in cluding education, the military, prisons, for estry, health, and the Metropolitan Water District. Harrison also or dered that the administration of Muslim Mindanao and the northern Luzon highlands of the Cordilleras be transferred from the U. S. Army to Filipino colonial of ficials, in corporating (in the ory, at any rate), these regions into the mainstream.

Quezon also lobbied for the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, otherwise known as the Jones Bill. This abolished the Philippine Commission and established a bicameral legislature. The Senate or Upper House would have twenty-two nationally elected members and two appointees to represent the non- Christian minorities. The lower house, for merly the Philippine Assembly, would have eighty elected members and nine appointees. Quezon resigned from the Assembly to run for the Senate, won easily, and was elected Senate President. Osmeña retained his speakership of the lower house. The Jones Bill also affirmed the U. S. goal of in dependence for the colony but set no date. Quezon’s support for this bill, and his belief that in dependence be with held until a majority of the population was literate, undermined the Anti- Imperialist League’s faith in him as a staunch anti-imperialist. That seemed to be the final straw for the League, which in any case had seen its membership dwindle. In 1921, the League folded its tents quietly. Governor Harrison reorganized the executive branch, now with six executive departments making up the cabinet. At the same time, the government acquired a controlling in terest in a number of businesses, such as the Manila Railroad, and set up the Philippine National Bank. In 1919, the first Independence Mission to the United States was for med, headed by Senator Quezon. In Washington, Quezon and company found President Warren G. Harding, a Republican who had succeeded Woodrow Wilson, not so welcoming, or receptive to the idea of in dependence anytime soon. Harding dispatched a fact-finding mission, made up of General Leonard Wood (the same general in charge of U. S. troops responsible for the 1906 massacre at Bud Dajo) and for mer Governor General Cameron Forbes (a grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson), to determine the readiness of the colony for self-government. The two concluded that in spite of advances, the colony was not quite ready for in dependence. Subsequently, President Harding appointed Wood as Burton Harrison’s replacement. In contrast to the affability of Harrison and his policy of Filipinization, Wood (1921-27) proved to be autocratic, probably due to his military training and temperament—diametrically opposed to the democratic spirit. He had the rather odd practice of having on hand an American witness whenever discussing weighty issues with Filipino leaders. As can be imagined, such an obvious sign of mistrust didn’t sit very well with them. Filipino politicians filed complaints against him with Harding’s successor, President Calvin Coolidge, but to no avail. Wood, a Republican, believed firmly in the role of private capital in the development of the national economy. To stimulate the growth of agribusiness, he favored the relaxation of restrictions on for eign ownership of land. Furthermore, he proposed the privatization of government-owned enterprises. The liberalization of controls was opposed by the Filipino legislators, headed by Quezon and Osmeña, who saw in these proposals a Trojan horse, by which the entry of capital-rich for eign in vestors and their subsequent control of the economy would be facilitated. Quezon, irritated by what he perceived to be Wood’s in transigence, uttered the most memorable comment of his political career: “I would prefer a government run like hell by Filipinos than one run like heaven by Americans.” At an impasse with Filipino leaders, Wood returned to the U. S. for a brain operation in 1927, but the operation was a failure and Wood died. Henry Stimson replaced him and managed to restore more cordial relations with in fluential Filipino leaders. The Depression Due to the financial meltdown that led to the Great Depression of 1929, economic in terests propelled U. S. private in dustry (agriculture, primarily) to push for Philippine in dependence. The change in status for the colony, it was hoped, would lead to the termination of duty-free exports from the Philippines. Independence would also result in stricter immigration controls vis à vis Filipino workers, now able to enter the U. S. freely and who were seen as unfairly competing on the labor market for jobs, depriving U. S. citizens of economic opportunities. Cheap Filipino labor had in fact been coming in since 1906, when fifteen young Filipinos boarded a ship for Hawaii, in itiating an exodus of Filipinos who would in the beginning provide a steady supply of labor for the farms and agricultural enterprises in Hawaii, and later for the West Coast. Filipino immigrant communities for med mostly bachelor societies—women were discouraged from emigrating, primarily to for estall the for mation of families and the putting down of roots—and would essentially remain so until the end of World War II. These pioneers and the men who followed in their footsteps came to be called the manong, or “elder brother.” By 1926, approximately 150,000 Filipinos had emigrated to work in the United States, with a spike in the exodus fueled by the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned further immigration of Japanese to Hawaii. By 1930, during the Great Depression, 75,000 manong were eking out a living in Hawaii while 60,000 worked the farms, or chards, and canneries on the West Coast, in cluding Alaska. For most of those going to the mainland, California was the favored destination.

Anti-miscegenation laws in the West Coast banned marriages between white women and Negroes, Mongolians, or mulattoes—with Filipinos being classified as Mongolians. When the courts in 1931 ruled that Filipinos were not Mongolians, California legislators craftily added the phrase “or member of the Malay race” to maintain the racial ban. Being seen in public in the company of a white woman a Filipino male (or for that matter, any Asian male) was liable to be harassed and even physically assaulted by those who took of fense at such racial mixing. Anti-Filipino prejudice reflected the larger anti-Asian sentiment as expressed, for in stance, in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Labor camps were of ten at tacked by white vigilantes, with serious in juries and some deaths resulting. The most eloquent chronicler of the travails of Filipino immigrant life before World War II was the fiction writer and poet Carlos Bulosan who, like the vast majority of nationals leaving for the United States, came from peasant stock. Largely self-educated, Bulosan, an Ilocano, penned the now classic, largely autobiographical novel America Is in the Heart, an in tense and of ten feverish account of a young Filipino labor or ganizer’s political and social awakening to the harsh realities of living in a society where racism was a constant, corrosive factor, exacerbated by the Great Depression. Bulosan himself was a labor or ganizer and activist and had been in volved in efforts to unionize farm workers that helped pave the way for the birth of the United Farm Workers, headed by César Chávez, a Mexican, with the vice president being Philip Vera Cruz, a Filipino. Bulosan’s activism landed him on the FBI’s blacklist. Plagued by ill health and broke, he died of consumption in Seattle in 1956, at the age of 43. More than half a century after Bulosan’s demise, at the end of 2009, an estimated 4 million Filipinos lived in the United States, the second-largest Asian-American group after the Chinese. These U. S.-based Filipinos have a median household annual in come of close to $66,000 and are ranked second to U. S.-based Indians, who have the highest in come of all U. S. households at more than $68,000. The Philippine diaspora to tals approximately 11 million, spread throughout the globe, from North America to the Middle East to the Scandinavian countries, with occupations ranging from doctors, nurses, and computer engineers to domestic workers and merchant marines.

Nicknamed the Os Rox Mission, it lobbied for the passage of the Hare-Hawes- Cutting Bill, which set out the specifics of in dependence—absent from the Jones Bill. In Manila, however, the Philippine Legislature opposed it, with the opposition headed chiefly by Manuel Quezon. He cited a provision that would allow the United States to retain military bases in the country as in imical to true in dependence. In reality, he viewed approval of the bill as politically disadvantageous to his ascension, Quezon himself not having been its chief architect. With support from sugar planters, who didn’t want in dependence at all, and revolutionary figures such as Aguinaldo and Ricarte, who wanted immediate in dependence, Quezon convinced the legislature to defeat the bill. (Ricarte was still a revered figure, who, rather than pledge allegiance to the United States, chose exile in Yokohama, Japan, where he made a living running a coffeehouse and teaching Spanish on the side.) Quezon then proceeded to Washington and helped push for the 1934 Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, which was virtually identical to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill. The difference, of course, was that this time it was his name associated with the bill. The act provided for a ten-year transition period before in dependence would be granted—and during that transition period the colony would be accorded commonwealth status. As provided by the act, a constitutional convention was for med, headed by Claro M. Recto, a Quezon protégé. The body drafted a constitution that was then submitted to the U. S. for approval. Franklin Delano Roosevelt gave his imprimatur in March of 1935 and by May 14, it was ratified by the Philippine electorate. The form of government was based on that of the United States, with a bicameral congress and three separate branches of goverment: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The act also classified Filipinos as for eigners for the purpose of immigration, setting a quota of fifty for entry to the U. S. Not surprisingly, the arrangement benefited the United States more than it did the Philippines. Free trade was to continue from 1935 to 1940, with certain restrictions on Philippine exports to the U. S., but with no such restrictions on U. S. exports to the Philippines. It was easy to see why: in 1934, the colony was the ninth largest market for U. S. goods, and the first for such exports as cigarettes, galvanized iron and steel sheets, paints, canned milk, and soap. In 1935, American in vestments in the archipelago were worth $200 million. The United States was ensuring that its economic advantages would not be lost even when the Philippines gained its in dependence. Thus, the 1935 Constitution protected the in terests of U. S. citizens and corporations, according these the same property rights as Filipinos. Moreover, in dependence was to be hedged with so many restrictions that essentially rendered the country a U. S. protectorate—as had been the case with Cuba. The trade preferences would have been disastrous for the country, and vested in terests on both sides of the Pacific did little to change these"

S. protectorate—as had been the case with Cuba. The trade preferences would have been disastrous for the country, and vested in terests on both sides of the Pacific did little to change these. While remedial legislation was being considered, true economic development remained a mirage. Domestically, labor and agrarian unrest continued to be a major source of concern to local governments and colonial rule. The lack of serious in dustrialization meant limited work opportunities, compounded by the fact that most arable land was concentrated in the hands of a few. Employment was available but mostly in low-paying jobs in agriculture. By 1938, out of a workforce of 4 million, more than three-fourths, made up of day laborers and sharecroppers, worked on farms and plantations. Clearly, any unrest among the ranks of agricultural to ilers would seriously affect the economic and political stability of society. The landed estates of the friars, which could have diminished the seriousness of land issues through sales to low-in come farmers, were in stead sold, as noted earlier, mainly to landlords and agribusiness. As in Spanish times, quasi-mystical peasant sects arose in response, of ten headed by in dividuals with messianic goals, but these rarely constituted a threat to public or der. Unlike under Spanish colonial rule, however, owing to a heightened sense of nationalist unity, this time there arose labor unions such as the Union Obrera Democrata. With its roots in labor activism of the past two decades, and in Partido Obrero de Filipinas, a pro-labor party founded in 1924, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) or Philippine Communist Party, was for mally or ganized on November 17, 1930, by Crisanto Evangelista, a labor militant. Active in peasant and labor or ganizations, and a firm believer in aggressive politics, the PKP quickly found itself hounded by the government. The Philippine Supreme Court declared the party illegal on October 26, 1932, for cing its key members to lead a clandestine life. Nevertheless it helped unify diverse peasant movements, especially in Central Luzon, a unity helped along when the PKP and the Socialist Party of the Philippines, founded in 1932 by Pedro Abad Santos, merged in 1938. With the outbreak of World War, II it went underground, along with other legal parties and in dividual Filipinos. But perhaps the movement with the most impact in the turbulent, Depression- plagued decade prior to World War II was the Sakdal (Indictment) movement, founded and led by Benigno Ramos. Ramos had been a protégé of Quezon when the latter was Senate President, but they had a falling out in 1930 when Quezon would not support a student protest against well-publicized anti-Filipino remarks by an American schoolteacher. Ramos subsequently established the Tagalog- language Sakdal, a weekly that regularly printed broadsides against Quezon, Osmeña, and their fellow politicians; American colonial administrators; and other pillars of the establishment. The publication grew to be enormously popular, its readership providing the base for the Sakdalista Party, established in 1933 and not surprisingly headed by Ramos. In the 1934 elections, Ramos and the Sakdalista candidates of fered the mselves as an alternative to the mainstream parties. The party platform called for immediate in dependence by December 1935, the curtailment of American control of the economy, overhaul of an educational system that was seen as too colonial, rejection of U. S. military bases in the country, and a redistribution of land. Harassed regularly by the government, the party nevertheless won three seats for the House of Representatives, a governorship, and several municipal of fices. The Sakdal leaders lost no time embarking on a campaign for the people to boycott the for thcoming plebiscite on the proposed Commonwealth Constitution. The government deemed such a campaign seditious, arrested a number of Sakdalistas, and cancelled permits for public rallies. These provocations resulted in violent uprisings in two days in May 1935, by close to sixty thousand peasants in about twenty to wns in the Tagalog provinces. The Philippine Constabulary units put down the rebellion violently, with fifty-seven peasant casualties, as the protesters were poorly armed and disorganized. Through such aggressive establishment tactics and with Benigno Ramos in Japan meeting with militaristic elements in Tokyo, the in fluence of the Sakdalistas quickly evaporated. Ramos remained in Japan until 1938; by then, the party he had founded was history— but not its profound resentments. The Commonwealth The Philippine Commonwealth was in augurated on November 15, 1935, following the timetable set down by the Tydings-Mc Duffie Act, with Quezon and Osmeña elected as its president and vice president, respectively.

Mac Arthur was reassigned to the colony—with out Louise as they had already separated and then divorced in 1929—as department commander from 1928 to 1930. He was recalled to Washington in August 1930, having been appointed chief of staff by President Herbert Hoover. On his return, he arranged for his Filipina mestiza mistress, Isabel Rosario Cooper, otherwise know as Dimples, to be lodged discreetly at an apartment in Georgetown. It was not uncommon for U. S. military men posted to the colony to have romantic liaisons with the local women; while winked at, such relationships were of ficially frowned upon. But there was one person whose disapproval Mac Arthur feared more than anything else: his mother, who was living with him at his of ficial quarters. He broke off with Dimples after four years, once two reporters, whom he was suing for libel, got wind of Dimples’s existence and threatened to reveal the relationship if Mac Arthur didn’t drop the court case. * And so he did. Under the National Defense Act, Mac Arthur was charged with building up an army of 300,000 troops, though in his typical grandiose manner, he declared he would have 400,00 by 1946. At the moment, he had only 10,000 in the islands. The next year, 1936, as a gesture to nationalists, the Quezon government set up the Institute of National Language, whose primary goal was to adopt and develop a national to ngue based on one of the principal native languages. By 1937, Tagalog, the language of the capital region (and of Quezon), was chosen as the basis of the national language, to be called “Pilipino”—much to the dismay of Cebuanos, who claimed to have more speakers than the Tagalogs and who were acutely aware that in spite of Cebu being the first Spanish settlement in the country, here they were, still overlooked almost four hundred years on. That same year, women were granted the right to vote. In the 1938 elections for the legislature, Quezon and Osmeña’s Nacionalistas dominated, with the opposition winning only five out of 98 seats. In 1940, the terms for the presidency and vice-presidency were changed from one six-year term with no reelection to one term of four years, with one reelection allowed— an amendment clearly meant to benefit the in cumbents. Later that year, to no one’s surprise, Quezon and Osmeña were reelected. Free Rather than Fair Trade Free trade enabled big business in terests in the colony to prosper; understandably, the American business community in Manila had misgivings about the colony getting in dependence from the United States. In little more than three decades since the start of colonial rule, the growth of imports from the United States was tremendous, in creasing ninety one times while in comparison exports to the U. S. grew thirty-two times. Eighty percent of Philippine export products were meant for the U. S. market. And 65 percent of goods brought in were from the United States. An over-reliance on the U. S. market thus made Filipino exporters uneasy about the prospects of in dependence. More importantly, it sidelined the need for in dustrialization. In public, Filipino politicians declared that free trade would hurt the economic in terests of the Filipinos, that such a policy favored vested economic in terests, opening the country’s commerce, in dustry, and agriculture to domination by American enterprises. In private, the opposition was much more muted, and after in tense lobbying, most politicians acquiesced to free-trade policies, in or der to protect their careers. At the same time, the easy access to American products worked against the emergence and development of local in dustry while cultivating in the Filipino consumer a marked preference for such products. Indeed, “Stateside” came to be a term that connoted a preference for U. S.-made products. Hence the establishment of a commonwealth that would ostensibly lead to in dependence was hedged with enough restrictions so as to ease the worries of powerful U. S. economic in terests. Independence would be granted but Philippine products would be at a disadvantage. At the same time, the Commonwealth Constitution protected U. S. business in terests so that the colony would still be a rich source of profits—as well as a base, still, for extending U. S. reach in Asia and the Middle East. In essence, the country was slowly but surely being transformed into a neo-colony, in dependent for mally but still largely tied to the apron strings of America. Land continued to be a burning issue in the countryside, with land policy mostly conservative. Although the colonial government declared its desire to broaden the base of in dependent ownership, American in terests clearly lay in not disturbing—and in deed strengthening—the system of landownership that had developed under Spain. And the ruling elite saw no reason to disrupt what had been a hugely profitable arrangement for so long. The same obstacles that had prevented a fair and equitable redistribution of land in the Spanish colonial era were still operative: poverty and ignorance, the resulting failure of many in dividual tillers to acquire the necessary land titles, and aggressive landlord resistance.

W ORLD W AR II AND THE G REATER E AST A SIA C O -P ROSPERITY S PHERE The 1930 s were a time of political turmoil in Japan (as they were in Germany and Spain). With very few natural resources, an expanding population, and an in creasing in dustrial output, the Japanese desperately needed for eign markets and access to raw materials. Its sizable commercial in terests in Manchuria were under threat from Chinese nationalists. Domestically pro-fascist elements came to dominate the military and political spheres. Plans were then made for a southward expansion, a policy referred to or iginally as Nan’yo that later became the more sinister-sounding “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” Due to construction of a highway leading up to Baguio City, the hill station the Americans had decided to build in the Cordilleras in northern Luzon, Japanese laborers were brought in, so that by 1903, the Japanese community in the islands numbered more than 1,000. By the 1920 s, the Japanese began to arrive in greater numbers; by the 1930 s they were a commercial presence in the archipelago. (Such presence in cluded a number of Japanese brothels in Manila and Davao, with Japanese prostitutes catering mainly to non-Filipino customers.) Trade between the colony and Japan was worth $17 million in 1931. Japanese entrepreneurs were especially active in the hemp, lumber, and fishing in dustries. In Davao, on the island of Mindanao, a sizable Japanese community had sprung up. At 18,000 strong, the Davao Japanese, a majority of whom came from Okinawa, controlled approximately 60,000 hectares—two-thirds of commercial agricultural land in the province. Employing 12,000 laborers, the Japanese had become the mainstay of economic development in Mindanao— aided by high-level, Japanese-paid lobbyists in the Quezon administration—and had helped make Davao the largest exporter of hemp in the world. Japanese entrepreneurs were active as well in the mining in dustry, establishing at least four mines. By 1934, Japanese merchants controlled 27 percent of the retail trade, 50 percent of the textile in dustry; 80 percent of the iron ore Philippine mines were producing was shipped to Japan. All these fueled suspicions that Japan was girding for war... While there was a growing awareness in the commonwealth of the threat posed by Japanese fascism, much of the Spanish community in the islands sympathized, if not openly supported, Generalissimo Francisco Franco and the fascist Falangists, who had emerged victorious at the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War in 1938. One exception was the or der of Capuchin monks, who were mostly from the Basque region, known for its fierce anti-Franco sentiments. The Casino Español, a bastion of Spanish conservatism in Manila, took down the Republican flag and raised that of Franco’s. The Catholic Church hierarchy as well as the leading Spanish businessmen and landowners, who were also close to and identified with the U. S. colonial rulers, approved heartily of Franco’s anti- Communist, anti-Republican campaign. They would be buoyed up later on by Washington’s recognition of the Franco regime. With a militaristic and expansionist government in place, Japan in vaded China’s Manchuria Province in 1937. With the on set of war in Europe and Hitler’s takeover of France, the Japanese Imperial Army pushed into French Indochina and used that as a base from which to launch further in cursions into China. In retaliation, the United States in October of 1940 halted the export of steel to Japan—an act the Japanese government deemed unfriendly. On July 26, 1941, Washington froze Japanese assets in the United States, and in August President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared his government’s opposition to in voluntary regime change and demanded that Japan with draw its for ces from Indochina and China. Later that year, trade negotiations were resumed between the two countries in a last-ditch effort to prevent further deterioration in relations that could lead to war. But by the end of November, the talks had proved useless. Preparations in the Philippines for an impending war were woefully in adequate. Quezon admitted to in sufficient food stocks, fuel, and air raid shelters. Mac Arthur seemed to have buried his head in the sand, confident as late as November 1941 that if the Japanese at tacked, it would be at the earliest in the spring of 1942. Mac Arthur was off by a season. World War II commenced for the United States and the rest of Asia when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Manila). Bombing of Manila followed nine hours later. By 3 a. m., Mac Arthur knew of the surprise at tack on Pearl Harbor but in explicably took no action. As a result, slightly past noon, Japanese warplanes found most of the U. S. planes on the ground. At least half of Mac Arthur’s air fleet was destroyed, the tragic result of nine hours of in decision. Both raids provided the dramatic opening salvo in Japan’s campaign to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and thus unite Asian countries under the Rising Sun. It was painfully evident that Mac Arthur had failed to build up a prepared army. The Japanese blitzkrieg was mostly uncontested, with Japanese troops landing in northern and southern Luzon, as well as in Davao. To spare Manila harm, Mac Arthur declared it an open city on December 26. By this time, he and other common wealth of ficials were on Corregidor Island, in cluding Quezon, Osmeña, and their families, while in Bataan, on Luzon, U. S. and Filipino troops regrouped. By early 1942, Mc Arthur, Quezon, Osmena et al. had slipped away to Australia, the nce to Washington, where a government-in-exile was quickly for med by the summer of 1942. Before Mac Arthur and Quezon went on their separate journeys out of the islands, the Philippine government, under the direction of Quezon, paid Mac Arthur $500,000 for his services to the commonwealth. Mac Arthur was free to accept any sum of money from the Philippine government as his employer"

      "ground_truth_context": ". As a result, slightly past noon, Japanese warplanes found most of the U. S. planes on the ground. At least half of Mac Arthur’s air fleet was destroyed, the tragic result of nine hours of in decision. Both raids provided the dramatic opening salvo in Japan’s campaign to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and thus unite Asian countries under the Rising Sun. It was painfully evident that Mac Arthur had failed to build up a prepared army. The Japanese blitzkrieg was mostly uncontested, with Japanese troops landing in northern and southern Luzon, as well as in Davao. To spare Manila harm, Mac Arthur declared it an open city on December 26. By this time, he and other common wealth of ficials were on Corregidor Island, in cluding Quezon, Osmeña, and their families, while in Bataan, on Luzon, U. S. and Filipino troops regrouped. By early 1942, Mc Arthur, Quezon, Osmena et al. had slipped away to Australia, the nce to Washington, where a government-in-exile was quickly for med by the summer of 1942. Before Mac Arthur and Quezon went on their separate journeys out of the islands, the Philippine government, under the direction of Quezon, paid Mac Arthur $500,000 for his services to the commonwealth. Mac Arthur was free to accept any sum of money from the Philippine government as his employer. However, once he had been reactivated in July of 1941 as an of ficer in the U. S. military, he was bound by army regulations that prohibited its members from accepting such cash gifts. This violation of army ethical rules was never made public, nor did President Roosevelt raise any objections Less than a month after Japanese planes began their in vasion, their ground for ces rolled into Manila on January 2, 1942, and proceeded to set up a mechanism for administrative rule that would on one hand seem to give Filipinos their in dependence and on the other ensure that the country would be part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As with the Spanish and the Americans, the Japanese declared that everything they were doing was for the benefit of the natives—which worried the natives no end. In the United States, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive or der that awarded Filipinos full veterans benefits if they enlisted in the U. S. Armed Forces. In California alone, 16,000 signed up; about 9,000 for med the First and Second Filipino Infantry Regiments. Overall, approximately 250,000 Filipinos fought alongside U. S. troops in the Pacific War. However, FDR and his military advisers, in cluding General Dwight Eisenhower, decided to focus on the European/Atlantic the ater before at tending to the war in the Pacific. Eisenhower in particular argued that sufficient for ces to recapture the Philippines could not be assembled with out hurting the war effort in Europe and the Atlantic. Consequently, in spite of a gallant, against-all-odds defense, on April 9, 1942, the beleaguered Filipino and U. S. soldiers in Bataan surrendered to the Japanese. Many men under arms, however, were able to escape to nearby Corregidor. Those who surrendered were for ced to march from Mariveles, Bataan, to San Fernando, Pampanga, and the nce to prison camps in Capas, Tarlac, in Central Luzon. The march was one of the grimmer episodes of the Pacific War and has been described aptly as the “Death March,” for the prisoners trudged in the to rrid summer heat—April and May are the cruelest months of the Philippine summer —with no food or drink. Stragglers were more of ten than not bayoneted or shot on the spot. Of the estimated 85,000-90,000 surrendered soldiers, approximately 25,000 perished before reaching San Fernando. From San Fernando, the prisoners were herded into trains that took them to Capas. In barracks meant for 20,000 occupants, 60,000 were crammed. Of those 60,000, by war’s end, about 45,000 had died due to illness, starvation, and exhaustion. Meanwhile the 11,000 troops on Corregidor, under the leadership of Lt. General Jonathan Wainwright, battled valiantly, but on May 6, 1942, he and his men surrendered to the Japanese, and with that, the Japanese takeover of the archipelago was complete. A puppet government was in stalled, with the for mation first of the Philippine Executive Commission, made up of politically well-placed Filipinos, among them Chief Justice of the Supreme Court José P. Laurel, later to become the nominal president of the country. Jorge Vargas, Quezon’s executive secretary and appointed mayor of Manila just before Quezon’s departure, was named head of the commission. Pragmatic above all else, a significant portion of the elite— fourteen out of twenty-four senators and thirty-five out of ninety-eight representatives—collaborated with the Japanese command, to ensure retention of their political and economic power. Collaboration, of course, was not limited to politicians. Quite a number of for tunes were made on the black market by unscrupulous businessmen supplying the Japanese with whatever materials were needed. Focusing on the Japanese promise of in dependence, as declared by Premier Hideki Tojo, enabled elite collaborators to cite this as justification for cooperating with this new in vader. Vargas, for in stance, expressed his “confidence and trust in the true and benevolent in tentions of the Japanese Imperial Forces,” while Congressman Benigno Aquino Sr. declared that Filipinos were Asians, “not Europeans or Anglo-Saxons.” And in a letter to the Japanese high command, a virtual political Who’s Who stated their in tent “to obey to the best of our ability and within the means at our disposal the or ders issued by the Imperial Japanese Forces for the … well-being of our people.” In reality, the promise of self-rule and a cultural renaissance was broken right from the start. All in stitutions that governed or in fluenced public life and perceptions were controlled by the military. This meant a media—newspapers, radio, even printing presses—that served the propaganda needs of the Japanese. The same process was repeated for education, government of fices, and churches. Just as the United States had done with English, the puppet government or dered the teaching of Japanese, or Nippongo. The Americans were portrayed as purveyors of decadence who had placed an undue emphasis on in dividual rights. According to General Hayashi Yoshide, director of the Japanese Military Administration (JMA), the United States had led the country down the path of “deceit and misguidance.” The lesson was clear: Filipinos needed to rehabilitate the mselves. A major role for the Philippines, as with other Asian countries taken over by the Japanese military, was to provide much needed resources for Japan’s war effort, whether in the building of weapons or in feeding its troops, which at its height, numbered more than 250,000 in the islands.

The diverting of crops, especially rice, to the soldiers meant great hardships for the masses. The miseries they suffered, and the many acts of brutality in flicted on them by soldiers in His Majesty’s Imperial Army, undercut the stated aims of Filipinizing the Philippines, strengthening rather than weakening pro-American sentiments. Since real power lay in the hands of the Japanese military, martial law was in effect. To stress that the Japanese were serious about liberating the Philippines from colonial rule and to wean Filipinos from pro-U. S. leanings, in dependence was to be granted earlier than 1946, the date promised by the United States. A hastily assembled Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence drafted a new constitution that was speedily ratified in September of 1943, the ink barely dry on the document. Delegates to a National Assembly were elected, as decreed by the new constitution, and in turn the delegates elected Laurel as the president. With the Allied of fensive in full swing, and U. S. for ces retaking strategic islands such as Saipan, bringing them within striking range of the Philippines and Japan, the tide started to turn against the Japanese. Nevertheless, on October 14, 1943, in front of crowds assembled by the Kapisanan sa Paglilinkod sa Bagong Pilipinas (KALIBAPI) or Association for Serving the New Philippines —in reality, a nationwide surveillance network—the new Republic of the Philippines was in augurated. To appeal to nationalists, the Japanese had brought Artemio Ricarte back to Manila from exile in Yokohama, where he and his wife made a living running a coffeehouse. Ricarte, already in his late seventies and a for mer general in Aguinaldo’s army known as “El Vibora,” or “The Viper,” had steadfastly refused to pledge allegiance to the United States. Supportive of the Japanese, he was a living symbol of the Filipino struggle for in dependence. He was on hand to assist in the raising of the Japanese flag on that fateful day, alongside the Philippine flag as an allegedly in dependent Philippine state was declared. Ricarte’s time had passed, however, and he no longer had the following he had had three decades earlier. Fleeing the American army to wards the end of the war, he died of dysentery in the Cordilleras. Mimicking a regular government, administrative machinery was set in place, along with a judiciary. Filipino diplomats were posted abroad wherever the Japanese reigned supreme. On the local level, the Japanese in stituted a system of neighborhood associations that served as distribution points for commodities and a source of labor and spectators at of ficial public events. More important, these associations constituted a widespread surveillance network, or ganized by the Kalibapi, which had displaced political parties, depicted as mere mouthpieces for American propaganda. The or ganization also in cluded a sub-branch for younger members. Launched on December 30, 1942, the death anniversary of José Rizal and a nod to nationalism, Kalibapi was headed by Benigno S. Aquino, father of Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., later to become the most famous political opponent of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970 s. Along with abusive and of ten violent Japanese soldiers, the Kalibapi rendered Japanese rule despicable to or dinary Filipinos. Where before they might have viewed the United States in a similar light given the horrors of the 1899 Philippine-American War, now they came in creasingly to long for the return of the Americans. Complementing the Kalibapi’s efforts was a more in sidious or ganization, the Makabayang Katipunan ng Mga Pilipino (Ma Ka Pili) or Patriotic Society of Filipinos, which was for med by Benigno Ramos, founder of the Sakdal movement, and a long-time sympathizer of the Japanese. The Makapili were armed and collaborated with the occupiers by pointing out those who were working with the underground or who otherwise displayed anti- Japanese sentiments. Often, Makapili members—hooded in public, to protect their identities—used their position to simply settle old scores. Resistance to the Japanese was widespread. Guerrilla bands and underground in telligence units, most headed by USAFFE of ficers, were everywhere, an ubiquitous threat to the fragile stability of Japanese rule. For the most part, the resistance hewed to U. S. plans for retaking the islands. One group, though, was steadfast in its opposition both to Japanese and to U. S. rule: the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon (Hukbalahap, or Huks), or the Anti-Japanese People’s Army. Organized in March of 1942, the Huks constituted the military arm of the Partidong Komunista ng Pilipinas and at its peak counted 10,000 members. The Communist Huk leadership couched their appeal to the peasants and farmers in terms of long-needed socio-economic reforms rather than hard-core ideological lines. These left-wing resistance fighters were most active in Central Luzon, where they set up the Barrio United Defense Corps, or BUDC, to act as local government units. The BUDC was critical to the economic survival of a community, making sure, for in stance, that the harvesting of rice was done quickly and the grain distributed before the landowner and the Japanese got their hands on it. While the Huks were nationalists, for tactical reasons, they didn’t oppose the USAFFE- led units since they had a common enemy. However, not a few of the pro- American groups were hostile to wards the Huks and, as the war drew to a close, would at tack them when the occasion presented itself.

On October 20, 1944, Leyte Island was retaken by U. S. for ces and the nce the reconquest of the rest of the islands was undertaken. Accompanied by Sergio Osmeña (now the acting president, Quezon having died in August of that year in upstate New York) and Carlos P. Romulo, the signatory for the Philippines to the United Nations charter on its founding in 1946, the good general declared from Tacloban City, Leyte’s capital, “People of the Philippines, I have returned.” Mac Arthur’s dramatic announcement was made even more so by the largest naval battle of World War II and one of the largest in history: the Battle of Leyte Gulf, actually four separate engagements between U. S. and Japanese warships, from October 23, 1944 to October 26. Two hundred seventy-six warships fought it out, with the U. S. enjoying numerical superiority: 209 on the U. S. side and 67 on the Japanese. Japan lost four aircraft carriers, three battleships, ten cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Such losses crippled the Japanese navy, no longer an effective deterrent to U. S. at tack on the homeland. The battle also witnessed the first use of the kamikaze (Japanese for “divine wind”), with planes converted into suicide weapons. Before the United States had secured to tal control of the air, kamikazes had sunk sixteen U. S. ships and damaged another eighty. Prior to the beach landing on Leyte, U. S. bombers had already struck in a south-to-north pattern, hitting Davao, the Visayas, and Manila. In early January of 1945, U. S. for ces stormed ashore on the west coast of northern Luzon, and subsequently, in southern Luzon. By the first week of February U. S. armored columns were entering Manila from the north. The battle to oust the Japanese from the historic city was fierce and apocalyptic—the fiercest urban battleground in the Pacific the ater, akin to the battle for Stalingrad. Innumerable accounts tell of Japanese soldiers committing at rocities during their retreat, while for their part U. S. artillery in discriminately pounded Intramuros, the historic matrix of Manila, to rubble. The city south of the Pasig River was essentially obliterated. The month-long fighting in Manila, from February 3 to March 3, 1945, was hand-to-hand and street-to-street, with 1,010 U. S. soldiers killed, and more than 5,000 wounded. Japanese casualties were 12,000. Of the civilian population, approximately 100,000 perished. Not taking into account the U. S. at omic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki cities later that August, the devastation of Manila ranked second only to Warsaw. On July 5, 1945, the archipelago was finally wrested from Japanese occupation. The commanding general of the Japanese Imperial Army in the islands, General Tomoyuki Yamashita—known as the “Tiger of Malaya,” for his capture of Malaya and Singapore from more than 100,000 troops under British command —was charged with war crimes, particularly with the at rocities in flicted by the Japanese army on civilians in the bloodbath that was the Battle of Manila. The general’s defense was that he was no longer in Manila when the U. S. began its efforts to reclaim the historic city. He had, with most of his troops, in fact retreated to the mountainous north, where he planned to of fer fierce resistance and thus delay significantly the in evitable advance on Japan, once the Philippines had been secured by the United States. Left in charge of Manila’s defense was Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi who, contrary to Yamashita’s or ders, decided to defend the city to the death. And it was, with disastrous results. Mac Arthur or dered a trial, had a court set up, and determined the rules under which it was to operate. After a three-week trial, Yamashita was found guilty and sentenced to die by hanging. The conviction was appealed by his defense team first, to the Philippine Supreme Court, and then to the U. S. Supreme Court, the main argument being that Yamashita couldn’t possibly have had a fair trial under the conditions set up by Mac Arthur, the commander of enemy for ces. In a 7-2 decision, the Court affirmed the verdict, with the two dissenters calling the execution “legalized lynching.” The sentence was carried out near Manila on February 23, 1946, five months after the Japanese had of ficially surrendered to the Allied for ces on September 2, 1945, on the battleship USS Missouri, anchored at Tokyo Bay."

[The United States should] continue to assume responsibility for the external defense of the Islands and be prepared to commit United States for ces, if necessary, to prevent Communist control of the Philippines.” —U. S. National Security Report, November 10, 1950 T HE I MMEDIATE A FTERMATH OF THE W AR T HE BLOODY CAMPAIGN TO WREST THE P HILIPPINES AWAY FROM the Japanese left the country in ruins, with the archipelago facing the seemingly in surmountable task of rebuilding. Manila was a shell of its pre-war grandeur, its heart, Intramuros, gutted. In an in itial estimate of the damages caused by war, the Philippine Bureau of Census and Statistics put these at close to $3 billion. Later the Philippines would file claims on the Japanese government for $4 billion. Claims from all the countries damaged by the Pacific War to taled $54 billion, an enormous amount that Japan would find all but impossible to pay. The Allied reparations committee, however, could not agree on the amount Japan could pay. In the in terim, the U. S. government authorized Mac Arthur, virtual emperor of Japan during the U. S. occupation, to compel the Japanese to make payments. Most of these in terim payments were in the form of in dustrial equipment. Additionally, Japanese assets in the different countries could be seized by their respective governments. However, in 1949, the U. S. unilaterally dropped its demands for payments, but the Philippines and other war-damaged countries objected. In light of ideological battle lines being drawn between the Soviet Union and the U. S., Japan was now seen as a vital cornerstone in Asia against the Soviet Union. Its economic recovery, unhampered by reparations, was crucial. In 1952, Japan signed a peace treaty with forty-nine nations, in cluding the United States. The treaty provided that Japan would negotiate separately with not just the Philippines but other war-damaged countries such as Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand. Four years later, Japan and the Philippines agreed to a reparations program wherein Japan would provide $500 million in free goods over a ten- year period; $30 million in technical services; $20 million in payments to war widows and or phans; and $250 million in long-term loans over a period of twenty years, to end in 1977. From the Japanese perspective, the reparations process would help reopen markets heretofore closed to them, and thus gain access to much-needed raw materials. While Osmeña was nominally the president of the commonwealth, Douglas Mac Arthur, as commander of the U. S. for ces, called the shots. He had at his disposal men, money, and materials, and he used them strategically to once again in sure firm U. S. control before Philippine in dependence would be declared on July 4, 1946. To do that, and to get a government up and running as soon as possible, he and his staff overlooked potential charges of collaboration against those of the political elite who had worked with the Japanese. Mac Arthur was especially keen on Manuel Roxas, his aide before the war and whom he much preferred to the fastidious and more in dependent-minded Osmeña, who had succeeded Quezon as president of the commonwealth when the latter died of chronic tuberculosis at Lake Saranac, New York, in August of 1944. Roxas’s star had risen fast in the pre-war political firmament: a politician from Capiz Province in the Visayas, he occupied the speakership of the Philippine Assembly in 1922 at the age of thirty. He worked with Osmeña on the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill, and later became secretary of finance under Quezon, becoming his trusted personal adviser. He was elected senator in 1941 and the outbreak of World War II saw him as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). He was captured by the Japanese in Mindanao in 1942, and he subsequently served in the puppet government set up by the Japanese, as the chair of the Economic Planning Board. Towards the end of the war, he escaped or was released by the Japanese High Command headed by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had, along with the cabinet, fled to the mountain resort city of Baguio in the north. Mac Arthur pushed for early presidential elections. But Roxas couldn’t very well run as the standard bearer of the Nacionalistas, since Osmeña, the party leader, was running for the presidency as well. Roxas thus broke away and founded the Liberal Party in January of 1946, making it the second-oldest political party in the country. The Nacionalistas Party had been around since 1907 when it was founded, and it dominated the political scene until the outbreak of World War II. Arguments were made that a two-party system was imperative for a democracy to flourish. Nonetheless it was the pursuit of personal ambition that motivated Roxas, thus setting a precedent regularly followed by those whose own ambitions were stymied by their party. Each party’s platforms were strikingly similar, and voters were asked to heed the call of one rather than the other not because of ideological differences, but because, pledged to the same ends, one party could achieve these more effectively than the other. In short, no major differences characterized the Nacionalistas from the Liberals and postwar party politics became almost exclusively personal politics. With the implicit view that governance was primarily for the benefit of those in power, the system encouraged personal and in dividual rather than party loyalty, with turncoats rewarded rather than punished.

With the implicit view that governance was primarily for the benefit of those in power, the system encouraged personal and in dividual rather than party loyalty, with turncoats rewarded rather than punished. Short-term in terests in variably prevailed over long-term ones. The left threw its support behind Osmeña, viewing Roxas with deep suspicion due to his wartime collaboration with the Japanese as a high of ficial in the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic.

Collaboration between Filipinos and the Japanese proved to be a more complicated issue than or iginally thought. Osmeña emphasized that the whole matter had to be examined judiciously, with out a rush to judgment that would view all those who worked with and for the Japanese at different levels and capacities in the same treasonous light. Civil servants for example had to keep on working, to in sure the everyday workings of government, which was not necessarily true of politicians. Rebuilding meant not only physical rehabilitation and the resuscitation of a moribund economy, but settling the issue of collaboration. Given that a significant number of the ruling elite had worked with the Japanese, many of whom were known, if not close, to General Mac Arthur, this issue was political dynamite. With the government in Washington in itially desirous that those accused be tried for collaboration, a People’s Court was in stituted precisely for this, but it was doomed from the start. For one thing, only fifteen judges were on hand to try 5,603 cases. It was a virtually impossible task. Moreover, twenty-five government prosecutors were permitted only six months to argue all the cases. For another, Mac Arthur had preemptively exonerated Manuel Roxas, a pre-war friend. While the matter of collaboration was still being discussed, the commonwealth government held elections in April of 1946, with Roxas and Quirino vying against Osmeña and Eulogio Rodriguez, and winning. Sixteen senators were also elected, along with ninety-eight congressmen, the full slate of the House of Representatives. While Roxas’s Liberal Party dominated, seven senators were from the opposition as were thirty-eight of the ninety-eight congressmen. Three months later, on July 4, 1946, in dependence-day rituals were held at the Luneta, not far from the historic Manila Hotel and the U. S. Army and Navy Club, and fronting Manila Bay where in 1898 Spanish gunboats were easily defeated. The United States relinquished its titular and tutelary hold on the country choosing the same date of its own in dependence to do so. The Stars and Stripes was lowered, and the Philippine flag, with its golden-rayed sun, raised in its place. The population of a still bleeding nation stood at 18 million. With Roxas and Quirino as its president and vice president respectively, the Republic of the Philippines was finally in dependent of the United States, its colonial master the past half-century. But was it truly in dependent? Having its own flag fly over the nation did not automatically mean the United States had relinquished control over these Southeast Asian islands, only that the means of control had become less overt. Rather than a clean, selfless hand-off— which was what had been promised—that day marked the transition of a colony to a neo-colony, similar to what befell Cuba at the end of the Spanish-American War. The status of the Philippines was closer to what the unlamented Federalistas (the country’s earliest political party, established in 1900) desired. The Federalistas had quickly acknowledged American sovereignty even as the Philippine-American War was raging and campaigned for an autonomous government along the lines of a protectorate. After a certain amount of time had passed, the party had planned to campaign for statehood rather than in dependence. Half a century later, the country’s status had come full circle. By winning the presidency and vice-presidency of the Commonwealth in April of 1946, Roxas and his running mate, Elpidio Quirino, under the banner of the Liberal Party, effectively ended Osmeña’s political career. The tandem presided over the transference of sovereignty from the United States to the newly for med republic on July 4, 1946. Roxas and Quirino were thus the last president and vice president of the commonwealth, and the first president and vice president under the postcolonial dispensation. Roxas didn’t serve out the full four-year term, however, as he died of a heart at tack while giving a speech in 1948 at Clark Air Force Base. It was only fitting that the unabashedly pro-U. S. Roxas passed away on American ground. Earlier that year, as expected, he had granted amnesty to all collaborators. There had been 5,603 cases filed, but only 156 had resulted in convictions, with only one relatively prominent figure convicted. The aftermath of the war of fered unparalleled opportunities to remake Philippine society economically and socially. But Douglas Mac Arthur was too close to the pre-war Philippine elite to in itiate any far-reaching reforms. As ment ioned in the previous chapter, the half-million dollar gift from President Quezon just before Mac Arthur had left the islands in 1942 was emblematic of such ties. The pre-war status quo was what the conservatives wanted, and it was what they got. In contrast, as commander of Occupied Japan, from 1945 to 1951, Mac Arthur and his staff in troduced land reform, helped break up the zaibatsu (the monopolistic in dustrial combines), and drafted labor laws, among other elements of change. Mac Arthur could afford to be dispassionate in his role as military ruler, an American shogun in Japan, having no personal or professional ties with Japan’s ruling elite. However, he did exonerate Emperor Hirohito and the rest of the imperial family for any responsibility for the war. He also accorded immunity to the Japanese bacteriological research units in exchange for data based on gruesome human experiments. That the United States was less altruistic with the Philippines can be seen in the number of strings it at tached to the for mal cessation of colonial rule. The new republic, having suffered a horrific three-and-a-half years of war due to its status as a U. S. colony, was in no position to refuse. Among those strings were economic agreements that favored the U. S. and a 99-year bases lease that placed significant chunks of Philippine territory under U. S. suzerainty. In the in terim President Harry Truman had decided to leave the issue of collaboration up to the civil authorities in Manila, ostensibly to display trust in the Philippine government to do the right thing but it was in effect a policy of appeasement"

In the in terim President Harry Truman had decided to leave the issue of collaboration up to the civil authorities in Manila, ostensibly to display trust in the Philippine government to do the right thing but it was in effect a policy of appeasement. He did so on the recommendation of Mac Arthur, who knew that, despite popular sentiment calling for retribution against those who had worked with the Japanese occupiers, the political establishment would not condemn its own. Any sustained in vestigation into their wartime activities would embarrass and alienate the pre-war elite who were back in the saddle. At the start of 1948, Roxas declared an amnesty for all suspected collaborators, sidestepping the thorny dilemma and effectively curtailing the existence of the People’s Court. The amnesty appeased many of Roxas’s powerful supporters, landlords, and other wealthy and socially prominent in dividuals who were suspected of wartime collaboration. T HE C OLD W AR Why was the politically explosive issue of collaboration allowed to wither away? Quite simply, the Cold War and the perceived threat of Communism emerged as the two most crucial and related issues the United States believed it had to deal with. With ideological fault lines being drawn up globally between the Soviet Union and its allies on one hand and the United States and its allies on the other—between the Free World and the Iron Curtain, in the jargon of the day —Washington’s overriding anti-Communism translated into continued support of the traditional Philippine oligarchy, whose own anti-Communist feelings were beyond reproach if only because this was what was expected of them. Besides, the hardships of World War II and the brutality of Japanese occupation transformed the image of the Americans from colonial oppressors to liberators. Except for the Huks, with their roots in anti-imperialism, most guerrilla groups viewed the Japanese as the only enemy. Harboring doubts that the postwar dispensation would be any kinder to wards their socialist goals, the Huks held on to their arms, ready to use them once more if no substantial reforms were undertaken by the government. Washington was relying on the oligarchy to restore or der, fight Communism, and to assure stable leadership in in dependence, equating stability with democracy. Roxas may have been a collaborator but more importantly this economic expert was anti-Communist and would align the Philippines with the United States. It thus became in creasingly difficult to criticize the establishment with out being thought of as a commie sympathizer. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the need for the ruling establishment’s unconditional support for U. S. Cold War policies meant U. S. authorities conveniently overlooked in stances of corruption. In one notorious case, war surplus property that had been stockpiled for the planned in vasion of Japan and valued at $137 million was to be sold off by a government commission, dominated by Roxas’s Liberal Party, over a period of three years, from 1946 to 1949. At the end of ficial sales tallied only $37 million; the question of where the balance of $100 million went was never satisfactorily answered. According to the American Chamber of Commerce Journal, this “constituted the biggest windfall in Philippine history.” There had been precedents, of course, during the Japanese Occupation, with the black market enabling many an unscrupulous businessman and/or politician to realize vast profits. And so a pattern of corruption was set that permeated the different levels of government bureaucracy, where appropriations for public services and programs, especially in rural areas, were in evitably depleted due to kickbacks and bribes—a pattern that continues to plague the government to this day. Now the enemy as defined by the Cold War was Communism. Washington looked in alarm at the postwar emergence of the Soviet Union as a superpower. At the same time, two developments in mainland Asia provoked further anxiety: the defeat of the Chinese Nationalists headed by Chiang Kai-shek and the establishment in 1949 of a Chinese Communist regime under Mao Tse-tung; and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The Korean War—which is, even in the twenty-first century, unfinished— began in June of 1950, when the army of the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea under Kim Il-sung crossed the 38 th parallel into the Republic of Korea. The war was the culmination of escalating conflicts between the two halves of a country that had been divided right after World War II once it had been freed of Japanese colonial rule, which had begun in 1910. Truman announced that U. S. for ces would be sent to Korea and used this opportunity to or der that aid to France’s colonial war in Indochina be stepped up, that the U. S.

Rather than stopping at the border, Mac Arthur’s for ces undertook in cursions into North Korea. China, feeling that its own security was under threat, responded militarily, sending in its own troops to fight alongside the North Koreans. It was a war of bloody stalemates. Because Mac Arthur had dared publicly rebuke President Truman’s war policies, he was fired. The general had wanted to escalate the war by in vading China and using atom bombs to create a nuclear fallout zone as a barrier. Such tactics would have widened the scope of the war and brought the Soviet Union into the fray—an outcome Truman wished to avoid. An armistice was finally signed on July 27, 1953—an armistice that has never led to a cessation of hostilities, merely their suspension. The Korean War and the French troubles with Ho Chi Minh seemed to exemplify the “domino the ory,” first expounded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in an April 1954 news conference on Indochina: “Finally you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the ‘falling domino’ principle…. You knock over the first ones and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have the beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound in fluence.” U. S. Bases Agreement A crucial element of U. S. Cold War strategy in Asia was the retention of bases in its for mer colony. While General Dwight David Eisenhower had advocated for the with drawal of all U. S. for ces from the Philippines—he believed that positive relations between the two countries overrode the bases’ importance—his was a decidedly minority view. While of ficial rhetoric extolled the “special relationship” between the two countries, with shared goals of promoting the democratic way of life, U. S. policy was decidedly less sentimental, assessing the value of the island nation primarily in relation to Cold War politics. Perhaps no one was more hard-nosed in this regard than the in fluential veteran diplomat and political scientist George Kennan. He was one of the principal architects of U. S. for eign policy during the early stages of the Cold War, arguing for a policy of containment when it came to the Soviet Union and its allies, whom he regarded as expansionist. Kennan was straightforward enough to dispense with platitudes when defining what the of ficial U. S. at titude to wards the Philippines should be. He stated: “We should cease to talk about vague and—for the Far East—unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.” Kennan suggested a hands-off policy when it came to the country’s in ternal affairs, as long as it continued to serve U. S. security needs in Southeast Asia. In a post-World War II planet, the United States was eager to build a network of bases overseas, to maintain U. S. hegemony and serve principally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union and to a lesser extent against newly in dependent for mer colonies that did not necessarily accept the U. S. in terpretation of what a world or der should be. These nations, usually referred to as the Third World, came to be regarded as satellites of one superpower or the other, rarely as in dependent ships of state. Asia, Africa, and Latin America of ten became sites of proxy wars, that is, wars rooted in local causes but in which the superpowers got in volved as a way of advancing their own in terests with out their own boots on the ground. Another term for these sorts of wars was Low Intensity Conflict (LIC)—low in tensity, that is, for the superpower though not for the actual combatants. Thus, the Philippines’ transformation to a neo-colony, with the United States still very much a dominant player in both its in ternal and external affairs. The fact that there were in 1949 in stalled a Communist regime in China, an anti- Communist government in Taiwan, and neutral and possibly leftist governments in both India and Indonesia only made the case for continued U. S. military bases in the region more compelling—from Washington’s perspective. Adding to U. S. anxiety about Communism in the region was a guerrilla war between the Commonwealth for ces in Malaya and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party made up mostly of ethnic Chinese. Like the Huks, the MNLA was an outgrowth of the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army. The conflict, begun in 1948, ended in 1960, with the capitulation of the MNLA. While there was no question that the newly in stalled Roxas administration was in lockstep with the United States, still, talks on the status of U.

On March 14, 1947, the two countries signed the Military Bases Agreement (MBA). The lease on all United States bases in the Philippines was extended to ninety-nine years, subject to extension the reafter. The agreement gave the U. S. control over twenty-three bases, sixteen in active use and seven others held in reserve, to be activated should the need arise. Facilities ranged from Sangley Naval Base in Cavite to Camp John Hay Rest and Recreation Center in Baguio City, from Subic Bay Naval Base (SBNB) in Olongapo, Zambales Province, to Clark Air Force Base (CAFB) in Angeles City, Pampanga Province. Subic and Clark were the largest U. S. bases outside the United States. Clark covered 14.3 square miles, with access to a reservation of 230 square miles, which in cluded the Crow Valley aerial warfare range. What began as the army base Ft. Stotsenburg in 1903 was now the largest American base overseas, bigger than the entire island of Grenada. Outside of Japan and Korea, Clark Air Base was the sole major operational U. S. Air Force in stallation in the far West Pacific, able to handle all aircraft, in cluding the largest military transports. Navy planners considered it a superb logistic-support base, essential to maintaining U. S. combat readiness. Subic Bay, eyed as early as 1572 by Miguel de Legazpi’s grandson, Juan de Salcedo, as an excellent deep-water port, had been developed as an arsenal by the Spanish in 1885. The U. S. Navy began to use it in 1901, and in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated it and about 100,000 acres as a military reservation. The largest naval in stallation outside the U. S., Subic of fered the Seventh Fleet a unique combination of ship, aircraft, and support facilities, with three major wharves, that could berth even the largest aircraft carriers. Additionally, Subic had the largest ship-repair facility in the Western Pacific, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Just as important, labor costs in the Philippines were the lowest available to the U. S. Navy. At the outset, both bases in cluded cities within their jurisdiction: Angeles for Clark, and Olongapo for Subic, though the two cities later on regained their autonomy. The bases agreement prohibited the Philippines from granting base rights to any other country and placed no restriction on the uses to which the U. S. could put the bases, nor the types of weapons that it could deploy or store there. Additionally, the MBA allowed the United States to recruit Filipinos into the U. S. Armed Forces. For close to five decades, the United States was sovereign within the bases, able to use them with fewer restrictions than anywhere else it had bases. A principal function for them of course was as springboards for U. S. in tervention in Asia. Projecting American might—and later, protecting its in terests—in Asia had always been an in tegral part of U. S. design. Prior to World War II, U. S. military units had been dispatched on three occasions from the colony: in 1900, to China, to help crush the Boxer Rebellion; during the Russian civil war in 1918 to 1920, to Siberia; and in 1927, to Shanghai, to help protect the Western expatriate community known as the International Settlement. Corollary to the MBA was the Military Assistance Agreement (MAA) of March 21, 1947. The MAA stipulated that a U. S. military advisory group, known as the Joint U. S. Military Advisory Group, or JUSMAG, be at tached to the Philippine Armed Forces. The agreement also provided for the training of selected Philippine military personnel in the U. S. As with Cuba’s Platt Amendment, the Philippines agreed not to accept military aid or advisers from elsewhere unless Washington consented. With the U. S. bases and military assistance to uted in part as necessary for the defense of the archipelago, the question arose, who exactly were the Philippines’ external enemies? Not being part of continental Asia, the country was secure from land-border in filtration. Furthermore, the country had had no historic or traditional enemies, except those who warred with Spain and later the United States, their for mer colonizers. The only credible threat to the stability of the country and the government would be from within, from its own population, and it was in the domestic arena where U. S. military assistance could be and was of ten utilized. Through such measures, the United States in sured that it would continue to play a dominant role in Philippine political life well beyond July 4, 1946. While such a strategy was anchored in the realpolitik of the Cold War it had its roots in the imperialism that underscored U. S. occupation at the start of the twentieth century.

Though semi-feudal conditions had long been part of the rural social fabric, with cyclical debt plaguing peasant families, still, the fact that landowners lived in their haciendas meant that paternalism (the old model for benevolent assimilation) allowed tenant farmers a basic security that supplemented their own meager resources. It softened the exploitative system, keeping in check but not quite eradicating discontent. That changed when the in cidence of absentee landlordism grew. In conformity with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the U. S. government had agreed to buy the huge landed estates of the Spanish friars. And it did, in 1903, with funds raised through the sale of Philippine government bonds. In turn, these estates, to taling close to 400,000 acres, were to be sold mainly to the landless. In reality, most of the landless peasants could ill afford to buy the proffered parcels of land. Those who did had no in stitutional support (government or private) to make the transition from tenancy to landowners. In the end, a majority were for ced to sell their small plots to wealthy landowners, to caciques and middle-class elements that had grown during the American occupation. Many if not most of the new landowners chose to continue living in to wns and cities, delegating the task of managing their lands to their managers, an arrangement that of ten led to abuse and more importantly to the breakdown of traditional landlord-tenant relations. Inevitably, the gap between these two social classes grew wider. Moreover, to the tenant farmers and sharecroppers, the political freedoms and sense of emancipation that American colonial rule promised to bring were nowhere in evidence. Coupled with two new bills that threatened to further weaken an already weakened economy—the Philippine Rehabilitation Act (PRA) and the Philippine Trade Act (PTA), to be discussed shortly—the Huks and the PKP felt they had no other option but to take up arms once again, as they had during the war against the Japanese. In this regard, Mac Arthur could have helped defuse the explosive social situation had he pushed for meaningful land reform, as he and Occupation authorities under his command were to do later on in Japan. But the general was too close to the oligarchy to in stitute any deep-seated changes. He had served in the archipelago at the behest of Quezon and had enjoyed rapport with, and the support of, society’s elite. From 1935, when he accepted Quezon’s of fer to build the Philippine army, until the outbreak of the war in 1941, the general and his wife lived in a magnificent penthouse with seven air-conditioned rooms at the luxurious Manila Hotel, fronting Manila Bay and near both the U. S. Embassy and the Army and Navy Club—a neat, roseate triangulation of a colonial world where most natives rarely in truded and then only to serve. The five-star accommodations were considered part of his compensation as a government employee; not only was he accorded the title Field Marshall by Quezon, he was also designated honorary General Manager of the hotel. Clearly, enjoying demigod status, Mac Arthur was not about to bite the hand that had fed him so well while in the Philippines. To in sure the passage of laws meant to preserve the U. S.-favored role in the Philippines, Roxas and the Liberal Party needed to undermine if not sideline the opposition in both chambers of Congress. The Nacionalista Party, having been weakened by Roxas’s defection, had joined for ces with the Democratic Alliance, an anti-collaboration party and among whose leaders were Communists. While the elections went to the Liberals, six Alliance candidates were elected to the House of Representatives. In the Senate three were known to oppose the proposed bills. Before the elected Congress in 1946 were the Philippine Rehabilitation Act (PRA) and the Philippine Trade Act (PTA). The PRA set limits on compensation. The estimated cost of restoration was P 8 billion, or $4 billion. Of this, the PRA would provide a to tal of $1.24 billion, broken down into $620 million to compensate for war-related damages; $100 million worth of army surplus and construction equipment; $120 million for in frastructure and public buildings; and $400 million for in dividuals and businesses that could document losses due to the war. There would also be $200 million for the Philippine Army but with the proviso that benefits for the 200,000 Filipinos who had fought with the U. S. for ces against the Japanese be with drawn—benefits that had been promised by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941. The Rescission Act of 1946, signed into law by President Harry Truman, stipulated that Filipino veterans who had served the U. S. military, either in their capacity as regulars in the Philippine commonwealth army or as guerrillas in units recognized by the U. S. military, should not be deemed to have been in active military, naval, or air service for the purposes of any law of the United States conferring rights, privileges, or benefits upon any person by reason of such service. Of all the countries allied with the United States during the war, only Filipino veterans were denied these benefits. (In 2009, this in justice was partly rectified when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a lump sum of $15,000 for veterans who were U. S. citizens, and $9,000 for non-U. S. citizens.

S. in vestors the same rights that Filipino citizens had to develop the country’s resources and to operate public utility companies. Such a provision ran counter to the Con stitutional requirement that sixty percent of corporations for med to develop these natural resources had to be owned by Filipinos. This meant that in reserved areas U. S. citizens could have ownership up to 100 percent, whereas other for eign nationals were limited to 40 percent—effectively discouraging for eign in vestment that was not American. The 1935 Constitution needed to be amended, a process that had to be approved by a majority vote in the legislature. It was made clear to the Roxas administration that this arrangement was a condition for rehabilitation aid. In turn, to make sure that the bills were passed, the Roxas administration through the Liberal Party-dominated Congress refused to seat seven representatives from Central Luzon, and three senators, all of whom had spoken out against parity. The Roxas government drummed up false charges against these legislators, claiming that they had won their respective electoral contests fraudulently and through violence, sidestepping the Electoral Tribunal created precisely to handle these kinds of cases. Even with the purge, however, the amendment to the Constitution barely passed, by a plurality of one vote. One of those denied his seat, pending the outcome of in vestigation into the charges (eventually dismissed), was Senator Ramon Diokno, who had been one of Quezon’s chief campaign strategists. He had this to say: This continuance of American control, however, could not have been achieved with out the solicitous assistance of the Filipinos that now rule our country. The Roxas government, which is headed by collaborators, obviously felt that it could not survive unless it accepted the Trade Act in or der to open the way for American financial and military aid. It needed money not only for material rehabilitation, but for the maintenance of an expensive governmental system…. The Roxas government chose to sacrifice Philippine in dependence for the sake of the advantage to be gained from American political and military support. This decision was not surprising, in asmuch as these were the same Filipinos that had worked readily with the Japanese, and that would have been removed from political and economic in fluence if President Roosevelt’s directive against collaborators had been carried out. Manuel Roxas himself violated his oath as General in the United States Army by advising puppet-president José Laurel to declare war against the United States and its Allies during the Japanese occupation. Luis Taruc, the Huk commander-in-chief of the Hukbalahap, was one of the congressmen unseated. From a peasant family in Pampanga, Taruc dropped out of college and, in fluenced by the in creasing radicalism of the peasantry, joined the PKP at the age of twenty-two. He distinguished himself during the war as a guerrilla fighter against the Japanese. The response of the Huks to this latest drawback was rebellion, met by a crackdown by the Roxas regime. The Huks were able to reorganize easily, and win support. The movement was concentrated mainly in Central Luzon, though it had pockets of support in the Southern Tagalog regions and on Panay Island in the Visayas. The Huks, for ged in the crucible of the war and buoyed by the successful 1949 Chinese Communist victory, emerged as a serious threat to Manila. They had proven to be a for midable foe of the Japanese, engaging them in 1,200 conflicts and killing approximately 25,000 enemy soldiers and those Filipinos believed to have collaborated with them. By war’s end, armed Huks numbered 20,000, with 50,000 in reserve. The thought of a pro-Soviet, pro-China Malacañang in duced sleepless nights in Washington, moving it to in terfere. During the war, the Huks had raised the political consciousness of the peasants even as they positioned the mselves in Central Luzon. By 1944, the Huks controlled significant areas of Central Luzon, anticipating a possible modus vivendi with the American-controlled Common wealth government once the war was over. But the U. S. Army’s Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC), in tandem with the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU), had other ideas, replacing the Huks with pro-American in dividuals, of ten drawn from USAFFE-led guerrilla groups and from the more conservative, upper class echelons of the local society, even if many of the latter had served the Japanese.

For a while, Roxas at tempted a pacification campaign, sending out mixed signals, but in the end, demanding that the Huks surrender all their arms. In a last-ditch effort, the Huk and PKP or ganizations responded with a memo to the president urging that all steps be taken to forge a peaceful resolution, asking, among other things, that private armies—landlord-sponsored and financed, and of ten the flashpoint of physical confrontations—be disbanded, all charges against the Huks for in itiatives taken during the war be dismissed, that the Democratic Alliance congressmen be allowed their seats in Congress, and that civil liberties be restored. The government’s response was to in crease militarization of Central Luzon. Secret or ders were issued for the arrest of Huk top leaders. Warnings went out to them, but failed to reach one in fluential peasant leader, Juan Feleo, who was abducted by men in Military Police uniforms and subsequently murdered. The Huks responded by reconstituting their armed squadrons and renaming the mselves the Hukbong Magpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), or People’s Liberation Army. They engaged both the Military Police and private armies when barrios were raided. Veterans of the war against the Japanese and with a tested or ganizational structure, the Huks usually got the better of government for ces. The Huks renewed the peasantry’s struggle over social issues such as land reform, health care, and decent wages. Initially hesitant to support the Huks—it believed the revolution would begin in the cities—the PKP saw in this agrarian uprising a golden opportunity to seize state power. Thus the revocation of the parity amendment and the with drawal of American military bases were added to the Huk agenda. Both the Huks and the PKP leadership saw how fruitless parliamentary struggle had been. With a restive, disillusioned peasant population of close to two million in Central Luzon, the Huks numbered twelve to fifteen thousand armed fighters. These developments were worrisome not just to Manila but to Washington. Under the 1947 Military Assistance Pact, and through the Joint U. S. Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG), an anti-Huk counterinsurgency campaign was put into place. Roxas died suddenly on April 15, 1948, and Elpidio Quirino took over the presidency. The Odd Couple Quirino granted amnesty to the Huks, but faulty implementation led to its failure. The in surgency resumed. Pressured by the U. S. military and the ambassador, Quirino appointed a young congressman, Ramón Magsaysay, to the post of Secretary of National Defense. Against the backdrop of the Cold War, fearful that the Philippines—a country that the U. S. had to uted as its showcase of democracy in Asia—might turn Communist, as had China in 1949, the U. S. government through the CIA took an in creasingly active role in the counterinsurgency tactics of the AFP. In August Truman had recommended an in crease in aid to the Philippines as well as to Southeast Asia, to combat Communist in fluence and aggression, specifically during the Korean War. Thus, aid in 1951 was four times that of the previous year. Instrumental in setting up the military programs, in cluding psychological war operations, was Air Force Colonel Edward Lansdale, a for mer advertising executive and now CIA covert operations specialist—and the model for Alden Pyle, the young American diplomat in Graham Greene’s The Quiet American, as well as Colonel Hillandale in William Lederer and Eugene Burdick’s The Ugly American. Shortly after Magsaysay’s appointment, Lansdale arrived in Manila and promptly or chestrated the anti-Huk campaign, living out of a suitcase at the defense headquarters, and calling the defense chief “brother”—his younger one, clearly. Under Lansdale’s tutelage, Magsaysay revitalized the Armed Forces of the Philippines, weeding out corrupt and abusive personnel and in stilling a sense of professionalism in the ranks. The tasks he and his soldiers faced were for midable. The Huks were popular not simply because they were the mselves farmers and peasants but because they had taken steps to remedy social in equities. They provided rudimentary but strict and consistent governance, where none had existed. To the disaffected rural poor, the government in distant Manila seemed to care for them only during elections, when for a brief moment the common tao was king and queen. To counter this and no doubt drawing from his advertising expertise, Lansdale put into practice a “hearts-and-minds” strategy, wherein government programs for the welfare of the peasantry were put into place, court cases speeded up, and army units undertook such projects as digging for artesian wells and extending medical care. Too, Magsaysay of ten accompanied the troops on their missions, whether in combat or to visit a remote barrio. He and Lansdale made sure these for ays were covered by the media, so that every photograph of the Secretary of Defense presiding over the surrender of Huks was a particularly effective bullet in the propaganda war, transforming Magsaysay into the common man’s hero. In addition, part of the counterinsurgency success was the government of fer of land in Mindanao for the landless Huk fighter. From 1954 to 1963, the government resettled 20,500 families of the Huks—a resettlement program that decades later would contribute to the conflict between the in digenous Muslim and non- Muslim tribes on one hand, and, on the other, descendants of the or iginal Christian settlers over land rights. One effective psychological warfare and counterinsurgency tactic Lansdale pioneered was to employ traditional beliefs in aswang, or vampires, to scare the Huks and their peasant sympathizers"

One effective psychological warfare and counterinsurgency tactic Lansdale pioneered was to employ traditional beliefs in aswang, or vampires, to scare the Huks and their peasant sympathizers. Army patrols would ambush a Huk and, through two puncture marks in his neck, drain the corpse of blood, leaving it on a trail. Fellow Huks or villagers discovering the body would then steer clear of the area, fearing the presence of aswang. New York Times correspondent Raymond Bonner, in his book on the Marcos regime, Waltzing with a Dictator, describes how “Lansdale concocted his ‘eye of God’ scheme, which he had borrowed from the ancient Egyptian practice of painting watchful eyes on the to mbs of pharaohs to scare away would-be plunderers. Lansdale made a sketch of these eyes, and at night members of his team would slip into villages and paint them on a wall facing the house of a suspected Huk.” Other psychological- war tactics in cluded flying airplanes above the clouds over Huk-controlled areas, with broadcasts in native languages to make the villagers believe they were hearing directly from the spirit world; and spreading rumors about the presence of aswang in the area. The combination of psychological warfare, hearts-and-minds programs, and old-fashioned military operations proved to be highly effective, setting the prototype for future counterinsurgency wars, most notably in Vietnam, but also in Latin America. U. S. in volvement in Vietnam in all likelihood would have been radically different with out this earlier in tervention in the Philippines. The success in breaking the back of the Huk in surgency, though, was as much Magsaysay’s doing as the CIA’s. He had become the humane face of the anti- Huk program, a veteran guerrilla fighter who in his in teractions with the rural folk lent a sympathetic ear to their too-common tales of high rents and landlord abuse, making free legal services available to them. According to a for mer Huk fighter, Alfredo B. Saulo, Magsaysay was aided tremendously when “Tarcisio Rizal, alias Arthur, a grandson of the national hero and disenchanted Huk commander, approached Magsaysay and gave him vital in for mation on the whereabouts of the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] hierarchy in Manila.” The in for mation led to the arrest of many of the top leaders of the in surgency, dealing the Huks a severe blow from which they never recovered. Many of the guerrillas simply resumed their lives, and a significant number accepted the government’s of fer of land in Mindanao and Palawan. With the backing of Washington, Magsaysay decided to seek the presidency. Lansdale and his CIA colleagues managed the campaign—from behind the scenes, of course. One of the CIA operatives helping in the campaign and occasionally writing Magsaysay’s speeches was David Sternberg, whose cover was as the correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor. Magsaysay defected from the Quirino-led Liberal Party to the Nacionalistas in 1952, along with Carlos P. Garcia, a congressman from the island of Bohol as his vice presidential mate. In the campaign against President Quirino, the Magsaysay camp relied on the catchy motto, “Magsaysay Is My Guy.” This could have very well referred to Lansdale’s control over the for mer Defense Secretary’s candidacy, in cluding the writing of his speeches by CIA operatives. Lansdale made sure that cash flowed in not only from Langley, Virginia, but from American expatriates in the Philippines. Magsaysay, too, had become their guy. Magsaysay won the presidency handily. He had put to good use his experience as Defense Secretary. Unlike the politicians of the old ilustrado or der, of which Quirino was a member, Magsaysay conducted a vigorous grass-roots campaign, visiting more barrios and sitios than other politicians. He dressed simply, ate with his hands when eating with the local folk, and tried to project the persona of a common tao. This was in stark contrast with Quirino, who favored white suits—appealing perhaps to the urban and moneyed classes but not to the countryside, where the vast majority of the population lived. During his term, the third president of the Republic struck a populist tone, declaring that “bare feet will always be welcome at the president’s palace.” At the same time, he was still very much Washington’s guy. He was in strumental in the for mation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Some of its aims are to foster economic growth, promote peace and stability in the region, and encourage cultural development. Partly as unofficial representative of the United States and partly out of self- in terest, the Philippines participated in the 1955 Bandung Conference of Afro- Asian states held in Bandung, Indonesia. The conference brought to gether nations newly in dependent from colonial shackles, desirous of seeking a third way or neutrality, and in many in stances, hostile to the U. S. but also wary of the Soviet Union. The conference aimed to cultivate economic and cultural ties between the at tending states, and to resist any colonial or neocolonial policies the superpowers and their allies might seek to impose on them. The Philippines was one of the few in at tendance that viewed the United States in a positive light. During the Magsaysay administration the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 was revised via the Laurel Langley Agreement of 1955. This new legislation eliminated some of the more odious language that demeaned Philippine sovereignty, though this was more style than substance. In force for the next two decades, the agreement still protected U. S. in vestments in the for mer colony but now extended the same degree of reciprocity to those Filipinos wishing to in vest in the United States. Considering the huge disparities in capital available respectively to U. S. citizens and to Filipinos, this was akin to what Anatole France once said about pre-Revolutionary France’s Legislation: “The law in its majestic equality for bids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges and to steal bread.” As a sop to the sugar barons who were an in fluential bloc in the Philippine Congress, the U. S. agreed to pay higher prices for their sugar than could be had on the in ternational market, thus providing a tremendous windfall for the sugar planters. Because of Lansdale and the CIA’s in fluence on Magsaysay—the president had appointed his ment or as military adviser—U. S. programs directed at other Southeast Asian countries could be run through a pliant Philippine government, which would provide legitimate cover. In the 1950 s the situation in French Indochina—Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—in particular, the Communist in surgency led by Ho Chi Minh, worried the United States. In 1954 Lansdale (now stationed in Saigon as an adviser to the South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem) set up the Freedom Company of the Philippines, through which Filipino personnel were sent to South Vietnam to help the regime. Magsaysay was the company’s honorary president. Under cover of a public service or ganization and having a contract with the host government, Filipinos (and the CIA) assisted Diem’s government, at one point training his Presidential Guard Battalion, and ran the huge Operation Brotherhood activity. The latter began as a humanitarian, largely Philippine, project in 1954, thought of by the Philippine Jaycees to alleviate the miserable conditions of refugees fleeing North Vietnam into South Vietnam. Operation Brotherhood functioned in Vietnam for two years, primarily through medical missions, then moved its operations to Laos at the end of 1956. Operation Brotherhood was yet another plausible cover to operate against the Communists and assist the Diem regime. It was only in Vietnam where Filipinos worked successfully. In the rest of Southeast Asia, they were perceived as being too pro-American, and their very presence in Vietnam seemed to confirm this. Confident in the friendship of Magsaysay, the U. S. didn’t shy away from the use of U. S. bases in the 1950 s, for covert operations against perceived anti-U. S., pro-Communist for ces not just within the Philippines—the anti-Huk campaign being the most well-known—but in Southeast Asia as well. Civil Air Transport, for in stance, was an airline owned by the CIA that flew out of Clark Air Base to ferry support to Indonesian right-wing army of ficers in their failed at tempt in the late 1950 s to unseat President Sukarno, a key architect of the nonaligned movement among Third World countries and one of the principal or ganizers of the Bandung Conference. Magsaysay’s presidency was cut short when, on March 17, 1957, he died in a plane crash, returning from Cebu City to Manila. An estimated two million mourners paid their respects to the dead president as his funeral procession wound its way through Manila. His death caused no small amount of confusion, as Magsaysay’s personal support and popularity had made various clandestine and not-so-clandestine activities possible, from the for mation of SEATO to covert programs in Vietnam and Indonesia, all justified by the on going project to convert the for mer colony into America’s much to uted showcase of democracy.

García, a Nacionalista who as vice president, had taken over the presidency; Manuel Manahan, for mer customs commissioner and a Magsaysay follower; José Yulo, from the Liberal Party; and Senator Claro M. Recto, the head of the Convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. The last was the U. S.’s bete noire. Recto was an outspoken nationalist who had served in the pre-war commonwealth government and had become in creasingly disillusioned by what he felt was unwarranted U. S. in volvement. He advocated a for eign policy that distanced itself from that of the United States. Thus, he felt it was in the best in terests of the country to deal with China even if it had gone Communist— heretical thinking as far as the United States was concerned that viewed Mao Tse-tung, an ally of the Soviet Union, as a major ideological enemy. The Korean War was a reminder that Mao’s Red Army was willing to mix it up with the U. S. and hold its own. But most galling to the United States government was Recto’s stand against the continued presence of U. S. military bases on Philippine territory. In 1956, Recto wrote that “by granting America extra-territorial rights in the bases, we surrendered to her the power, the jurisdiction, and the sovereignty of the Republic over portions of the national territory whose in tegrity is guaranteed by … the Constitution. So the Agreement, in stead of in suring our territorial in tegrity accomplished the very opposite.” U. S. strategy had always been to emphasize the bases as a contribution to Philippine defense. Recto’s stance skewered this position. In 1957 he emphasized that even American commentators highlighted the use of the bases in the Philippines as a diversion for enemy at tacks, especially a nuclear one, that would spare the lives of Americans in the United States. He cited one Hanson Baldwin, an expert on the U. S. military who wrote regularly for The New York Times, who believed, according to Recto, that “the role of U. S. overseas bases in the world—bases in the Philippines are among them—is to ‘act as magnets for enemy at tacks, thus dispersing and weakening his threat to our [United States] cities and fixed in stallations.’” Recto had only to point to Japan’s in vasion of the Philippines in 1941 as proof of this fatal at traction. Recto saw first-hand how Magsaysay’s feeling of in debtedness to Washington had in fluenced Philippine government policy. It was a classic example of utang na loob, a social quality, deemed a virtue, whereby a man who had benefited significantly from a patron’s in tervention was for ever in that patron’s debt. In Magsaysay’s case, he felt beholden to Lansdale and the U. S. for his success in quelling the Huk rebellion and in winning Malacañang. Too, it helped that Magsaysay himself was staunchly anti-Communist. Recto had broken completely with the popular president and for med the Nationalist Citizens Party. His in creasingly nationalist stance worried the CIA. Its operatives blanched at the possibility that a Recto victory would result in Manila dealing openly with Mao’s China. The NCP lacked funds, however, and a smooth electoral machinery. The two dominant parties, the LP and the NP, colluded to deny it election in spectors. The conservative Catholic hierarchy had no love for Recto either, as he had in 1955 championed the compulsory reading and teaching in colleges and universities of José Rizal’s anti-clerical novels. His Rizal bill, as it was known, passed, but exempted students who had religious objections from reading the novels. The proviso in effect enabled Catholic educational in stitutions (and they were, as in the Spanish colonial era, the dominant force in private education) to simply not in clude the books on the curriculum, even if there were students who may have wanted to study the life and works of the national hero. As to be expected, the CIA used its bag of dirty tricks against Recto, and had him labeled as a Communist dupe. According to J. Burckholder Smith, a CIA operative in Manila at the time, the agency spread the word that Recto was “a Chinese communist stooge, an agent in filtrated into the Philippine Senate (shades of Senator Joe Mc Carthy).” Smith further states that “he had been subjected to various dirty tricks. As I went through the files, I found something that absolutely astounded me. I saw a sealed envelope marked ‘Recto Campaign.’ I opened it and found it filled with condoms, marked ‘courtesy of Claro M. Recto—the People’s Friend.’ The condoms all had holes in them at the place they could least afford to have them. I tried to find out what purpose the condoms had been supposed to serve. The best I could do was to learn that they were distributed to show how Recto would let you down.” Unlike the condoms, the CIA didn’t fail. And so Claro M. Recto, garnering barely 400,000 ballots, lost the presidential election to García. What aided García as well was the fact that, in cluding Recto, three rivals had split the opposition vote. Relatively unknown, García had been a guerrilla during the war in Bohol, his home province, though he belonged to a unit in dependent of the USAFFE. Not particularly identified with U. S. in terests, unlike Roxas and Magsaysay, García had opposed the Bell Trade Act and the Military Bases Agreement. As chief executive of the land, this diminutive man proved more in dependent of U. S. thinking than the late, burly Magsaysay.

Most shockingly to those American hands and seasoned politicians who expected residents in Malacañang to be unswervingly loyal to the U. S., he drew up a Filipino First policy. As promulgated by the government National Economic Council, it was a policy “of the government to encourage Filipinos to engage in enterprises and in dustries vital to economic growth, stability, and security of the country,” giving special at tention to businesses that might in fact be controlled by non-Filipinos. The policy also laid down stringent rules on the allocation of for eign exchange, favoring Filipinos or corporations that were at least sixty percent controlled by Filipinos. As to be expected, U. S. and pro-U. S. sectors denounced the Filipino First policy. The U. S. Chamber of Commerce, through its publication, described the program as “nothing less than in sane,” with “measureless loss and waste, retrogression, and demoralization.” A February 27, 1959, issue of the U. S. News and World Report depicted it as “extreme nationalism,” going on to say that what the program in tended to do was in separable “from what the Communists say and want.” Even more disturbing to the pro-U. S. sectors was the coalition between García’s NP and his for mer rival for the presidency, Recto and his NCP, gearing up for the 1959 senatorial elections. A mass or ganization had also sprung up, the National Progress Movement, which aimed to generate support for a nationalist- or iented government, to wards which the retention of García was deemed necessary. The NPM ascribed to the sizeable alien communities (Chinese and American) in Philippine society the root causes of “graft corruption in the government and ultimately, in the entire society,” for these aliens sought to buy off government authorities and thus extend their in fluence. The NPM came down particularly hard on Filipinos working to advance for eign in terests, describing them as “parasites who feed with out contributing to their own national community, its culture and the civilization it may yet at tain.” The García and Recto coalition as well as the NPM in effect turned a critical eye on the neocolonial legacies of U. S. rule. Filipinization echoed the earlier policies of the colonial-era William Howard Taft, ironically enough, but this time carried to its logical conclusion: adoption of nationalist programs as envisioned by the Filipino First policy; elimination of the parity amendment to the Constitution; an in dependent for eign policy; and in dustrialization. The 1959 elections saw the defeat of for mer Magsaysay men and pro-U. S. adherents, and the victories of more in dependent legislators, in cluding the for mer Solicitor General Lorenzo Tañada. Emboldened by the 1959 electoral results, President García declared in a major speech in 1960 that the control of the economy by aliens “makes a mockery of our in dependence and robs it of substance and meaning.” It was necessary, the refore, “that Filipinos acquire a major and dominant participation in the national economy of the Philippines.” At the same time, he stressed that his government’s economic policies were not anti-American, that they were “simply an honest-to-goodness effort of the Filipino people to be masters in their own economic household for exactly the same reason that Americans would be masters of the U. S. national economy … In this country there is still room for for eign capital, especially in fields where Filipino capital is deficient or timid.” And what were the results of the Filipino First policy? For one thing, the policy enabled Filipinos to secure 51 percent of for eign exchange allocations by the end of 1959. It liberalized government credit to new Filipino businesses, resulting in fresh in fusions of capital into the in dustrial sector. In December 1959 only 55 percent of new in vestments were Filipino; by 1961 the figure had jumped to 88 percent. In the in dustrial sector, a significant development came with the creation of the Filipino Oil Refining Company in 1959, challenging the dominance of U. S. and other for eign oil companies. There was the Iligan Integrated Steel Mill, Inc., a $1 billion venture, the first stage of a full-fledged Philippine steel in dustry, which began loan negotiations with the World Bank, the U. S. Export-Import Bank, and other lending in stitutions. Iligan represented a partnership of government and private Filipino capital and exemplified the García’s administration’s in dustrialization policies. In 1960, the Manila Electric Company, or Meralco, a U. S. owned company founded in 1903, was acquired by a financial group headed by the López family for $66 million. All these developments seemed to augur well for full-scale in dustrialization. For the 1961 elections a García-Recto ticket loomed as a real possibility— and a perceived threat to pro-U. S. in terests. Claro M. Recto died in Rome, however, of a heart at tack on October 2, 1960, leaving the nationalist movement bereft of its leading in tellectual and political voice. Not surprisingly, the opposition to García swung behind his vice president Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party. Macapagal, along with the Grand Alliance ticket, whose slate had been defeated in 1959, campaigned on issues such as corruption; the necessity of maintaining an anti-Communist stance (which the nationalist Filipino First was thought to have hurt); development of free and private enterprise; and minimal government in terference in the private sector, or the adoption of essentially neo-liberal laissez-faire economic policies. The issue of strict controls over for eign exchange allocations proved damaging to García, for it was one the Macapagal camp exploited, charging the government with using controls as a means of patronage"

      "Emboldened by the 1959 electoral results, President García declared in a major speech in 1960 that the control of the economy by aliens “makes a mockery of our in dependence and robs it of substance and meaning.” It was necessary, the refore, “that Filipinos acquire a major and dominant participation in the national economy of the Philippines.” At the same time, he stressed that his government’s economic policies were not anti-American, that they were “simply an honest-to-goodness effort of the Filipino"

      "ground_truth_context": ". In 1960, the Manila Electric Company, or Meralco, a U. S. owned company founded in 1903, was acquired by a financial group headed by the López family for $66 million. All these developments seemed to augur well for full-scale in dustrialization. For the 1961 elections a García-Recto ticket loomed as a real possibility— and a perceived threat to pro-U. S. in terests. Claro M. Recto died in Rome, however, of a heart at tack on October 2, 1960, leaving the nationalist movement bereft of its leading in tellectual and political voice. Not surprisingly, the opposition to García swung behind his vice president Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party. Macapagal, along with the Grand Alliance ticket, whose slate had been defeated in 1959, campaigned on issues such as corruption; the necessity of maintaining an anti-Communist stance (which the nationalist Filipino First was thought to have hurt); development of free and private enterprise; and minimal government in terference in the private sector, or the adoption of essentially neo-liberal laissez-faire economic policies. The issue of strict controls over for eign exchange allocations proved damaging to García, for it was one the Macapagal camp exploited, charging the government with using controls as a means of patronage. With Recto no longer on the scene to in sist on a strictly nationalist or ientation, the García campaign declared that it would gradually ease controls—a concession to free marketers. Macapagal’s campaign team also utilized their candidate’s impoverished background as a selling point. He was the “poor boy from Lubao,” a small town from Pampanga, the Central Luzon province. He managed to at tend law school, and to pped the bar exams in 1936. He went on to serve as legal assistant to Quezon. After the war, having served two terms in the House of Representatives, in 1957 he ran as the vice presidential candidate of José Yulo on a ticket that opposed García. Yulo lost to García, but Macapagal won. (In the Philippine electoral system, the vice president is voted in in dependently of the president.) In contrast García, who had acquired a reputation for poetry as a young man, came from the gentry of Bohol, where his father had served as mayor of their town for four terms. Macapagal and his running mate Emmanuel Pelaez won the 1961 elections by a substantial margin. President Macapagal immediately signaled his administration’s commitment to free enterprise. One of his first acts was to implement decontrol of for eign-exchange allocations and of imports. The government had previously with varying degrees of success at tempted to minimize the squandering of dollar reserves by requiring the purchase of a license with which to purchase dollars and thus ship in imports. An in evitable result was a black market in the sale and purchase of such licenses, enabling many, in and out of government, to illicitly amass considerable wealth through the disparity in the of ficial and unofficial exchange rates. With easy money to be made, not much energy was channeled to wards setting up new in dustries. Corruption thus became a potent issue with which Macapagal hammered García during their electoral contest. On the advice of his cabinet, Macapagal adopted neo-liberal economic policies, and decided to let the peso float, which had until then been pegged at a two-to-one ratio to the dollar. With the new policy, the peso’s value dropped to P 3.90 to the dollar. Liberalizing trade meant easing or eliminating protectionist measures, resulting in a sharp in crease in the shipment of U. S. goods to the country and a corresponding decline in the sales of their counterpart Philippine products. While the devaluation of the peso meant that prices for U. S. products —which were prized, “Stateside” being a mark of approval—in creased, it also meant that those domestic in dustries that had imported equipment and contracted for eign loans now saw their operating costs and more significantly their capital obligations practically double. In addition, the facilitating of credit to local in dustry, which the García administration allowed, was curbed. As a result, squeezed on both ends, as many as 1,500 Filipino in dustries that had sprung up because of García’s Filipino First policies were driven out of business during Macapagal’s tenure, or were absorbed by larger companies, many of these having substantial U. S. in vestments. The devaluation of the peso in evitably made in vestment in the Philippines more at tractive to for eign capital. Another unwanted consequence of decontrol, from the point of view of local in dustry, was the easier repatriation of profits of U. S. companies once restricted under exchange controls. With dollars flowing out, and imports flowing in, the country’s for eign reserves declined. To alleviate this, the government began to in crease its for eign debt. At the end of García’s term, the country’s for eign debt stood at a completely manageable $200 million. In 1962, in its first year in of fice, the Macapagal administration sought and got approved a $300 million loan from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the U. S. Treasury. Going into Ferdinand Marcos’s tenure, by 1972 the country’s external debt stood at $2 billion. Macapagal had set a pattern of borrowing that has been followed ever since, essentially adhering to the free-market policies of in ternational lending agencies that encouraged for eign in vestment by lifting controls, tightening credit, allowing the local currency to float, and reducing spending on social programs. President Macapagal at tempted to address the age-old issue of land reform, getting Congress to enact in 1963 the Agricultural Land Reform Code. It was an ambitious law that sought to abolish sharecropping tenancy, and carve out of large estates smaller family-size farms. The law promised to provide a wide variety of government technical and credit assistance to the beneficiaries of the reform. But a landlord-dominated Congress at tached so many conditions and exemptions that beyond reorganizing a number of agencies and redefining their functions so as to streamline their operations, this law achieved little in the way of meaningful change. In the first half of the 1960 s, coincident with the Macapagal administration, nationalism continued to build steam even as government policies reflected the old-or der accommodation with the United States. Macapagal was savvy enough to recognize this, and in recognition of the country’s revolutionary past, he declared Independence Day June 12—when Aguinaldo in 1898 had proclaimed the in dependence of the country—rather than the previously designated American-in spired July 4.

The latter date was then designated as Philippine- American Friendship Day. There were some grumbles from staunchly pro- American sectors but no serious complaints, as the change, while an important symbolic concession to nationalist sentiment, affected neither the economic nor political arena. One of the slogans the Macapagal administration to uted was for the citizenry to complete the “Unfinished Revolution”—a clear reference to the Bonifacio-led 1896 Katipunan Revolution. As the 1960 s wore on, there was a growing awareness as well as critique of how colonial legacies had shaped the cultural landscape, from education and pop culture to the way history had been written and the use of English as the dominant language of national discourse in education, politics, the arts, and the media. The rebelliousness of the decade would be expressed vigorously and dramatically in the latter half, during the tenure of the next president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. F ERDINAND M ARCOS: B EFORE M ARTIAL L AW Born on September 11, 1917, in Sarrat Town, Ilocos Norte Province, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos may never have had a political career had he not been able to beat a murder rap against him. The murder victim was Julio Nalundasan, a political rival of his father who had just won the congressional election for the district. He was shot to death one night in 1935, with a.22 caliber bullet. The young Marcos, known to be a member of the University of the Philippines pistol team, came under heavy suspicion. Three years later, in 1938, he was arrested, jailed, and subsequently convicted. By then, Marcos had graduated from the University of the Philippines law school. On appeal—which Marcos wrote in his cell—the Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision in 1940, the same year the future dictator to pped the bar. The chief justice was José P. Laurel who would in a little more than two years head the government under Japanese occupation. After the war, in which he claimed to have led a crack guerrilla unit that scored numerous successes against the Japanese, Marcos had a short stint as a practicing lawyer. He then ran for and won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1949. After two successive terms, he campaigned for the Senate as a Liberal Party candidate in 1959, and managed Macapagal’s run for the presidency of the country. By then he had been married to Imelda Romualdez, a statuesque for mer beauty pageant queen from Tacloban City, capital of the Visayan island of Leyte. Imelda had gone to Manila in 1953 at the age of twenty-four to stay with her wealthier city cousins and seek some kind of gainful employment. While visiting Congress in 1954—her uncle was then speaker of the house—she met Ferdinand Marcos in the cafeteria. After a whirlwind courtship that lasted all of ten days, the two were married at Manila Cathedral. Initially, Imelda had difficulty in the role of a well-known politician’s wife, with its unceasing demands for public appearances with her husband and so little time for herself and her family. At one point, the young and in experienced Imelda suffered a nervous breakdown and sought treatment in New York City. The treatment was apparently successful, perhaps too successful: she returned to Manila, having made up her mind to fully accept her role as a public figure and the varied and exhausting obligations that came with it. As she grew accustomed to being in the public gaze, and as her husband climbed all the way to the top, she developed sharp political in stincts that enabled her to become a powerful player in her own right. Imelda proved to be a tremendous asset to Ferdinand’s campaign for the presidency, for which, in a now time-honored though dubious practice, the ambitious senator switched from the Liberal Party—Macapagal, its head, was running for reelection—to the Nacionalistas. The youthful and glamorous Imelda made most other politicians’ wives look positively dowdy. Putting to use her beauty pageant experience, she was soon wowing crowds with her charm and earnest singing, of ten in duets with her husband. A huge feature of the hustings in Philippine politics is entertaining the crowds that gather to hear different candidates make their pitches. The palabas, as these spectacles are known, regularly feature movie and media celebrities, and a candidate who can add some showbiz to his or her or at or ical skills is almost sure to win more votes. The lady from Leyte proved to be a charmer of fstage as well. Needing a vice presidential candidate, Marcos had approached Fernando López, the sugar baron and media mogul and one of the richest men in the country. His bailiwick was the Visayas, where Imelda was from. Initially reluctant to be on the Marcos team, he was sweet-talked into it by Imelda. The Marcos-López combination proved to be a winner, and in December of 1965, both men were sworn into of fice. Hailed as the Jackie Kennedy of Asia by the Western press, Imelda held considerable cachet with the public, and this was flamboyantly demonstrated in 1966, when the Beatles flew to Manila for a two-concert stopover on July 3, 1966. The next day, July 4, they were scheduled to perform at the open-air Rizal Memorial Stadium. The Fab Four had been in vited to Malacañang to have an early lunch before the first concert with Imelda, along with three hundred schoolchildren. There was a mixup in communications, and the quartet slept through the appointed hour, blissfully unaware that they had disappointed not just the First Lady but a whole bevy of pre-teen Beatles’ fans. Word got around about the alleged snub. Departing the next day for New Delhi, the band and their entourage were manhandled as well as booed by outraged crowds"

The unfortunate in cident would prompt George Harrison to remark that if he were ever to return to Manila, it would be to drop an at omic bomb. While the country had a highly trained English-speaking professional workforce, there simply weren’t enough jobs to keep pace with the in flux of graduates that every year flooded the labor market. Coupled with a growing population, chronic bureaucratic in efficiency and endemic government corruption, the Marcos government faced for midable challenges in revitalizing an ailing economy. In his in augural address, Marcos acknowledged the challenges the country faced, stating, “We have ceased to value or der. Government is gripping the iron hand of venality, its treasury is barren, its resources are wasted, its civil service is slothful and in different, its armed for ces demoralized and its councils sterile.” In the manner of John F. Kennedy, to whom he liked to be compared, he exhorted his compatriots to work with him and rise to the occasion: “Not one hero alone do I ask from you, but many—nay, all.” Marcos proved to be a shrewder bargainer than his predecessors when it came to dealing with the United States. Adopting a nationalist tone while maintaining client-state status with the United States, he used in-country U. S. military bases as a bargaining chip to secure more dollars, which his administration deemed rent but which the United States labeled “aid.” United States in volvement in Vietnam was escalating, and Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base were key staging points for that in tervention, as they had been in other, earlier Asian conflicts. In 1966, after in tense negotiations, the Lyndon B. Johnson administration and the Philippine government agreed to reduce the bases lease from 99 years to 25 years, to end in 1991 and the reafter be renegotiated. The war in Vietnam was an economic shot-in-the-arm, at least in the short term, for the economy, particularly for the metropolitan areas in which Clark and Subic were located. Playing up his anti-Communist card, and trumpeting his devotion to democratic principles, Marcos was a master manipulator of U. S.- Philippine relations. Out of self-in terest, Washington ignored the in creasing levels of corruption, both personal and governmental, within the Marcos administration. The legitimacy of Marcos’s tenure, in deed, of the traditions of centralized political power in an oligarchy and the neocolonial relationship with the United States, was challenged by a dramatic in crease in student activism globally along with a resurgence of radical left-wing movements. In particular, 1968 proved to be a watershed year in this respect, an in dication of how far the energizing and liberating spirit of a counterculture had spread, one that used drugs regularly and for whom rock’n’roll was a religion. In Chicago, anti-war demonstrators at the Democratic Convention were brutalized by Mayor Richard Daley’s cops. In New York City, students occupied Columbia University’s administrative of fices. Students rioted in Paris and in Prague defied Soviet tanks that rolled in to crush the stirrings of a nascent democratization known as the “Prague Spring.” And on the birthday of Mao Tes-tung, December 26, 1968, a young University of the Philippines professor by the name of José Maria Sison founded the breakaway Communist Party of the Philippines in reaction to what he considered the outmoded Soviet-leaning PKP. (He and other student radicals from the University of the Philippines and Lyceum of the Philippines had been recruited in 1964 by a revived PKP.) Sison, born in Ilocos Sur, was a 1959 graduate of the University of the Philippines and started teaching there as a literature professor. Active in student politics, he founded the radical student group, Kabataan Makabayan (KM), or Nationalist Youth, in 1964. The group or ganized protests against the Vietnam War as U. S. in volvement in that Southeast Asian country was in creasing. Its members also regularly demonstrated against Ferdinand Marcos’s administration. The new CPP identified with Mao’s China rather than with the Soviet Union, Sison arguing that the Chinese model was closer to home. Not only were the Chinese fellow Asians, but the guerrilla strategy Mao advocated—that of surrounding the cities from the countryside—made tactical sense. Too, the Cultural Revolution, begun in 1966, in spired young left-wing ideologues with its aim of purging classist elements from society and renewing the commitment for the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship. Additionally, many Filipino student activists had visited the People’s Republic of China and had for ged relationships with the Chinese. In March of 1969, Bernabe Buscayno, a young Huk guerrilla in Tarlac Province, Central Luzon, and his outfit, unhappy with the Huk leadership, joined for ces with Sison to create the New People’s Army. The son of dirt-poor tenant farmers whose widowed father had given him and his siblings up for adoption, Buscayno had been radicalized at a young age, and helped or ganize farm laborers. It wasn’t a particularly auspicious beginning, as the twenty-five-year- old Buscayno, with the nom de guerre of Kumander Dante, and his band of about 35 fighters had between them only ten rifles. Nevertheless, the CPP/NPA grew, slowly at first and with painful and at times bloody birth pangs, but surely, through Luzon and the rest of the country—aided immeasurably in its growth by Ferdinand Marcos’s declaration of martial law three years later, in 1972.

Nine months after the CPP was founded, in September of 1969, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) was in augurated. It was Imelda’s personal project—the first of many grandiose projects she would undertake in her long political career and for which she was sardonically said to have an “edifice complex.” At the festive opening ceremonies, California Governor Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were Imelda’s honored guests, beginning a special relationship that would immeasurably benefit the Marcoses during the martial- law era. Critics derided the Center as a waste of money in an impoverished country. The CCP cost $8.5 million—a huge sum in those days—with $3.5 million coming from the U. S. government, which classified the money as war damage claims. Furthermore, Filipino in tellectuals and artists believed the Center was designed to showcase the West rather than fulfill any home-grown aspirations. Indeed, the first months of programming featured in ternationally known groups like the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the New York Chamber Soloists. There were dance companies from India and operatic troupes from China and Japan. No matter: with the CCP, Imelda made it clear she was at the very least determined to be a national cultural force, a czarina of the arts. In 1969, Ferdinand Marcos won reelection against Sergio Osmeña Jr., son of the for mer commonwealth president, thus becoming the first Filipino president to win a second term. However, his 2,000,000-vote margin of victory was glaringly and credibly suspicious. Marcos would probably have won in a by-the- rules contest, since Osmeña was a lackluster politician but in the hardball, no- quarter-given world of Philippine politics, the in cumbent was expected to use every resource at his command to guarantee victory, even if it meant overkill. By all accounts, up to that point, the elections were the most corrupt and expensive, rendering government coffers practically bare and resulting in in flation. The results provoked widespread outrage, none more so than among students and workers. By then, Marcos had embarked on a self-mythologizing path, and it was through one such endeavor that student activists were able to get a measure of revenge. Their in strument happened to be Dovie Beams, a barely known, C-List Hollywood actress who had been hired in 1968 to play the romantic lead on a biopic of Ferdinand Marcos, Maharlika. She wound up playing a real-life role as his mistress for two years—a role bigger than any she ever had on the silver screen. Tiring of her, Marcos broke off the relationship at the start of 1970. Imelda by this time had gotten wind of the affair and was furious at this betrayal. Beams, fearing for her life, placed herself under the protection of the U. S. Embassy. Unbeknownst to Marcos, she had tape recorded some of their amorous trysts, as the implications of her romantic entanglement became clear to her. She played some of the tapes at press conferences. Copies were surreptitiously made and leaked to the public. Student activists at the University of the Philippines got hold of a copy, one in which, according to a published account, the president is asking Beams to perform fellatio. The delighted students broadcast it in an endless loop over campus radio, much to the public embarrassment of the presidential family—and the ire of the First Lady. On November 11, 1970, Beams, escorted to the airport by a U. S. consul, boarded a flight back to the U. S. L’affaire Beams couldn’t have come at a worse time, as protests against the Marcos government had reached fever pitch during the First Quarter Storm, or FQS. The FQS was the most violent manifestation of unrest in postwar history up to that point, made up of rallies, protests, and marches held by a coalition of student groups—Sison’s Kabataan Makabayan was a major player—labor unions, and farmer or ganizations between January and March of 1970. The object of their ire was the Marcos government, seen as especially corrupt, and its collaboration with the United States in its war against the Vietnamese. The FQS began on January 26, 1970, on the streets outside of Congress, after Marcos’s state-of-the-nation speech. As he and the elegantly at tired Imelda exited, they were met by a screaming crowd of 20,000 students, workers, and peasants, mouthing obscenities and displaying papier-mâché crocodiles (symbols of rapacity), hurling rocks and bottles. Never had any of the nation’s previous presidents been so embarrassed. Things came to head on January 30, 1970. Protesters marched to Malacañang and the worst riots in the country’s history erupted when the demonstrators at tempted to storm Malacañang. Shouting slogans targeting U. S. imperialism and the subservient role of the Philippine state and bemoaning the lack of a true democracy, the demonstrators somehow commandeered a fire truck and rammed it into one of the palace gates. The protesters were dispersed violently by policemen and soldiers, in cluding the Presidential Security Guard. In the ensuing melee, a twenty-three-year-old university student was shot in the head.

An even more explosive—literally and figuratively—event took place the next year that made a nervous society even more nervous. On the humid night of August 21, 1971, the Liberal Party, in opposition to Marcos’s Nacionalistas, was holding a campaign rally for its senatorial candidates for elections scheduled for later that year. The outdoor gathering was at Plaza Miranda, Manila’s Hyde Park and a historic spot for rallies of all sorts. More than 10,000 supporters were on hand, many, no doubt, there just to enjoy the palabas. Two fragmentation grenades were lobbed onto the stage after 9 p. m., killing a five-year-old child, a photographer, and seven others. Ninety-five were in jured, in cluding three of the Liberal candidates and the candidate for the mayoralty of Manila, who lost one of his legs. The blame naturally fell on Marcos and his minions, though years later the CPP head José Maria Sison was thought to have or dered the bombings. Both Marcos and Sison denied the charges. The bombings created tremendous sympathy for the Liberal Party, so that six of the eight Senate seats up for grabs went to the LP, as did the mayoralty of Manila. By 1972, the Marcos administration repeatedly warned of the fast-spreading Communist threat from within, with Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile leading the chorus. In September, three days after another warning issued by Enrile, two early morning explosions damaged Meralco sub-stations, with little damage. The military blamed Communist plotters. The crowning moment in this Moro-Moro (a Spanish colonial-era drama where the ending is utterly predictable) was the fake assassination at tempt on Enrile himself. On the fateful day of September 21, 1972, Enrile had decided to ride in his security car, rather than his own, later escaping the fusillade of automatic-weapons fire directed at his car by ambushers. His good for tune was ascribed to God’s in tervention. The deity in this case, however, was a two-personned God: Marcos and Enrile himself. The at tempted assassination, according to the government, left it no choice but to declare martial law. The next day, September 22, Proclamation 1081 put into place martial law, signed by President Marcos but backdated to September 21, due to the president’s superstitious belief in the magical powers of 7 (by which 21 is divisible). Military units fanned out across the city to arrest political opponents, activists, and anyone suspected by the regime of subversion. The first politician picked up was Senator Benigno Aquino Jr."

My answer is yes; although sugar land is not covered by the land reform law, I shall sit down with my family to explore how the twin goals of maximum productivity and dispersal of ownership and benefits can be exemplified for the rest of the nation in Hacienda Luisita.” —Corazon C. Aquino on land reform while campaigning in Mindanao, January 16, 1986 M ARTIAL L AW: T HE N EW S OCIETY S ENATOR B ENIGNO A QUINO J R., OR N INOY, AS HE LIKED TO BE called by friends and followers, was President Marcos’s most charismatic opponent and likely to be the central figure for above-ground opposition to martial law. From the Central Luzon province of Tarlac, he was the son of the late Senator Benigno Aquino, who had served with José Laurel in the Japanese-controlled Philippine government during World War II. The younger Aquino was something of a wunderkind, having worked as a correspondent in the Korean War for the Manila Chronicle at the age of seventeen. At twenty-one, he took on a job as an adviser to then Defense Secretary Magsaysay and when the latter was elected president, acted as his emissary to Luis Taruc. After in tense negotiations, the Huk chief agreed to an unconditional surrender. Aquino rose through the political ranks impressively, being elected as mayor of his hometown at the age of twenty-two, the youngest ever in the country’s history, as well as being the youngest elected senator later on. He would undoubtedly have been the Liberal Party candidate for president in the 1973 presidential elections, running against Marcos’s Nacionalista Party standard bearer, had not the imposition of martial law and one man’s megalomaniacal ambitions derailed the nation’s normal political processes for a decade and a half. Ninoy was arrested and charged with conspiring against the government, and with illegal possession of firearms. In late 1977, a military tribunal sentenced him to death, a sentence that was immediately suspended as the regime had no desire to canonize its most celebrated prisoner. Aquino would be imprisoned for nearly eight years before being allowed in 1980 to fly with his wife Corazon and children to the U. S. for heart surgery, having suffered a heart at tack two months before. Another well-known opposition senator, Senator José Diokno, was arrested as well. Along with Aquino, Diokno had been one of the more persistent and vocal critics of the Marcos government. Older than Aquino, Diokno had served as justice secretary under President Macapagal and had made a number of powerful enemies in his in vestigations of corruption, for which he was relieved—a sure sign he was doing his job. Upon his release, Senator Diokno would go on to become a fearless champion of human rights during the repressive years of dictatorial rule. Both senators charged that the spate of bombings (mostly harmless, except for those at Plaza Miranda) and the in cessant harping on the in ternal Communist threat were government tactics meant to create the right circumstances under which martial law could be imposed. A week before the fake ambush on Defense Secretary Enrile, and the subsequent declaration of martial law, Aquino laid bare before the Senate “Oplan Saggitarius,” that he said had been leaked to him by his confidential sources. According to Aquino, “Saggitarius” had been prepared by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) at the behest of the president, by which a series of provocative in cidents would be stage-managed so the government could blame violent anti-government factions, and thus justify declaring a state of emergency. Marcos dismissed the accusation as politically motivated and promised that he would seek Senate counsel before such a drastic step were taken. No such counsel was sought when he did impose martial law. In a press release issued by the president’s of fice on that fateful date, Marcos stated that martial law’s immediate aim was to “eliminate the threat of a violent overthrow of our Republic.” He added that reform was imperative, and that he was determined to clean up “government of its corrupt and sterile elements,” as well as undertake “the liquidation of criminal syndicates and the systematic development of the economy.” Presumably martial law was meant to restore law and or der and shore up public trust and confidence in the government’s ability to ensure a productive, peaceful, and stable civil state. But in fact, the of fice of the Philippine president had enough constitutional authority to have the laws enforced strictly, in cluding disbanding the numerous private militias in the provinces that prominent politicians and powerful businessmen employed for security and the in timidation of rivals. Having their own hired guns also made it easier to mock the rule of law and get away with it. The availability of firearms in the immediate aftermath of World War II and the failure of political will in the central government all but encouraged the emergence of clan-based warlords. Martial law wasn’t necessary to achieve these goals, but clearly Marcos needed a legitimate reason to stay on in power—the constitution limited a president to two terms. Orchestrating an at mosphere of lawlessness enabled him to proclaim martial law. He gave the proposed makeover of the country the rather grandiose title of “The New Society,” a riff on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society,” and he created the Kilusan Bagong Lipunan, or New Society Movement. Marcos envisioned a reinvigorated nation-state that would navigate its way between the violent methods of both left- and right-wing extremists. The path chosen by the New Society would be what Marcos termed “constitutional authoritarianism”: by relying on the powers granted to him by the constitution (through the use of its state of emergency provision) the government would undercut the extremists and break up the country’s entrenched oligarchy controlling most of the country’s resources and wealth. Thus, the New Society would ensure a more equitable distribution of in come and eliminate a major cause of unrest among the population. This in turn would weaken the left’s critique of a ruling dispensation favoring the privileged few over the masses. Nevertheless, the underground left would keep hammering at the state and the refore, the threat of a Communist takeover had to be met firmly, through an in crease in the military’s strength; the suspension of civil liberties (that the New Society portrayed as being routinely abused by anti-government activists); a crackdown on groups that regularly challenged the establishment, such as labor unions, student activists, peasant or ganizations, and even journalists; and the confiscation of unregistered firearms along with the dissolution of private armies"

A curfew was imposed and military and police checkpoints set up in many parts of the country, especially in and around Metro Manila. In its drive to restore an at mosphere of peace and or der, the government claimed to have confiscated half a million firearms. At the outset, civil society grudgingly accepted limits on its liberties. Traffic rules were obeyed, garbage collected, street crime was down, and petty government bureaucrats, mirabile dictu, seemed more conscientious in the performance of their duties and not so eager to solicit bribes. To for mulate the the or etical and operative principles along which the New Society would be constructed, Marcos relied heavily on technocrats, more so than any previous administration. It was also a public relations ploy, as the jargon of the technocracy imparted to government policies a veneer of professionalism and legitimacy. Yet, in one respect, Marcos was exactly like most other dictators: he and his wife eagerly sought to portray the mselves as saviors of an embattled country. They had a predilection for casting the mselves in Philippine mythological terms: He was Malakas (Strength) and she was Maganda (Beauty), alluding to the Philippine creation myth, in which the first man and woman emerged simultaneously from a grove of bamboo as equal partners, fully for med and perfect. In one painting, Ferdinand, Imelda, and their children are portrayed as though they were a royal family. In addition, Ferdinand authored several ghostwritten books, among them Progress and Martial Law and The New Philippine Republic: A Third World Approach to Democracy. As early as 1965 he commissioned the film biography Iginuhit ng Tadhana ( Destined by Fate ), before commissioning Maharlika, which starred the ill-fated Dovie Beams. As dictator, he or dered a gigantic bust of himself to be set up on a mountainside, à la Mt. Rushmore, in northern Luzon’s Cordilleras, on land for cibly taken from an in digenous tribe. He also relied on an in creasingly compliant Constitutional Convention, which was convened in 1971 but whose proceedings were in terrupted by martial law. The Con-Con, as it was known, was meant to draft a new law of the land that would replace the colonial-era 1935 constitution. When it resumed its deliberations after the imposition of martial law, the convention—through being bullied and manipulated by Marcos partisans—was transformed into a rubber stamp for Marcos’s legislative agenda, a principal objective being to convert the current system of government into a parliamentary one, thus allowing him to stay in power beyond 1973, when his second and last term was to end. At his behest, his followers in the convention manipulated the drafting of the constitution so it extended martial law, authorized rule by decree, and the or etically allowed him to be both prime minister and president. The 1973 constitution was ratified through spurious citizens’ assemblies, dominated by Marcos loyalists, rather than through a national referendum. It was a constitution created, in short, to serve the needs of one man rather than the nation. Uncle Sam’s Blessing In the Philippine political world, how far one rises nationally is of ten linked to how well one cultivates, or is seen to cultivate, ties with Washington—a perception founded on colonial-era realities. It was automatically assumed that something as momentous as martial law had the support, albeit in direct, of the United States. True enough: hardly the type to raise a fuss over ethical conduct, embroiled as it was in the beginnings of the Watergate scandal that would ultimately force President Nixon to resign in 1974 in or der to avoid impeachment, the U. S. government continued to support Marcos. Besides, with the war in Vietnam proving to be disastrous for the United States, resulting in its with drawal in 1975, having a staunch anti-Communist ally, one that moreover hosted two of the largest U. S. bases in the world, assumed even more importance. Given that Henry Kissinger—Nixon’s national security adviser and later secretary of state and the refore the prime architect of Nixon’s for eign policy— was a firm believer in realpolitik, Marcos was pretty confident of U. S. support. For Marcos too was a master at playing the game of realpolitik, and he knew that as long as the United States’s economic and military in terests—its bases and in vestments in the archipelago—were left untouched, then it would be business as usual. Following a predictable script, Marcos could, and did, sound all the right nationalist notes and still act as a subaltern of the United States. The wily strongman even committed a contingent of Philippine troops to Vietnam, the Philippine Civic Action Group, or PHILCAG, early in his first term. Consisting of an engineering battalion and medical and rural development teams, the 1,350- strong outfit worked on non-combat missions, mainly civic projects. For all its rhetoric about democracy and the rule of law, the United States had almost always supported dictatorial regimes that were allied with U. S. strategic in terests. The 1970 s proved to be a golden decade for U. S.-backed strongman rule. The 1973 coup by General Augusto Pinochet that to ppled the democratically elected government of left-leaning Salvador Allende in Chile had the blessings of Washington. So did General Park Chung-hee in South Korea, Suharto in Indonesia, the military junta in Argentina, and the Shah in Iran.

With Kissinger and Nixon in control of American for eign policy, America’s support for dictators in creased, in direct proportion to diminishing concern for democracy. American businessmen in the Philippines were more effusive in their support of constitutional authoritarianism. The American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, headed by a William Mitchell, sent the president a congratulatory telegram on September 27, 1972, just five days after the state of emergency had been declared: “The American Chamber of Commerce wishes you every success in your endeavors to restore peace and or der, business confidence, economic growth and the well being of the Filipino people and nation. We assure you of our confidence and cooperation in achieving these objectives. We are communicating these feelings to our associates and affiliates in the United States.” A 1973 study conducted by the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U. S. and meant for its in vestors who were concerned with U. S. corporate responsibility abroad, made it clear why the American Chamber of Commerce was so effusive. In 1971, the year preceding the declaration of martial law, 47 U. S. corporations were among the top 200 Philippine corporations and accounted for close to 32 percent average in to tal sales, in come, assets, and equity, a percentage that in creased to approximately 40 percent when considering only the top thirty-five. Among the 47 were the multinationals Caltex, Exxon, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi Co, Ford, Union Carbide, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, and Del Monte Corporation. (The Del Monte pineapple plantation in Mindanao coincidentally occupies 20,000 hectares, or 44,000 acres, of prime agricultural land that has never been subject to land reform.) One immediate result of Marcos’s grab for power was the substantial in crease in military aid from the Pentagon. Under the U. S. Military Assistance Program, in place since 1947, aid in creased dramatically, from $80.8 million in the four years prior to martial law, to more than twice that—$166.3 million in the succeeding four years. Clearly not coincidental, this in crease signaled to the Marcos regime that the Pentagon was willing to help in countering the Communist threat that martial law was supposed to address. Too, the aid bolstered the case for keeping U. S. bases on Philippine soil. But the U. S. State Department’s own assessment of Marcos and martial law was decidedly more somber, with a report stating “that martial law was not necessary to deal with the country’s problems, which have in fact been considerably aggravated by Marcos’s corrupt political style; that based on his record of ruthless self-aggrandizement he cannot necessarily be counted on to implement significant reforms.” Marcos’s dictatorial rule exposed the darkness at the heart of U. S. for eign policy: as had been shown repeatedly in the past, in spite of the rhetoric, democracy was hardly the most important issue for the U. S. government when it came to its client states. Paramount were its economic and security in terests. Marcos played the role of nationalist very well, but he was still “America’s boy.” The United States embassy seemed to have no doubts about Marcos, as it did about his opponents. It went along with martial law, convinced that Marcos would protect American in terests. If martial law meant taking liberties with the people’s own liberties, so be it. Even as economic conditions and the state of human rights deteriorated over the course of twenty years of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos’s rule—and Imelda was as much a ruler as her husband the longer they remained in power, hence the reference to the partnership as a “conjugal dictatorship”—five successive U. S. presidents supported the Marcoses with little to no restraint exercised: Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan. Even when President Carter (1977-1980) emphasized human rights, it was more lip service than anything substantial when it came to the Philippines. U. S. aid flowed as before, and beyond some cosmetic changes, the Marcos regime knew it could continue on its repressive course. Under President Ronald Reagan (1981-88), who had as governor of California and with Nancy at his side at tended the in auguration of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1969, personal relations between the White House and Malacañang dramatically improved, to the dismay of critics of the Marcoses both domestically and abroad. Marcos’s brand of constitutional authoritarianism fit perfectly with the for eign policy principles enunciated by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s neoconservative for eign-policy adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, who was fiercely anti-communist and who believed in supporting repressive regimes as long these regimes went along with U. S. policies. Kirkpatrick’s views dismayed U. S. liberals who were shocked, shocked, that their government would endorse another government’s routine violations of its citizens’ most fundamental rights. Reagan’s support for the Marcoses was demonstrated most vividly when, on the occasion of his visit to Manila in 1981, Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush to asted Marcos by saying with a straight face, “We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process.” The or dinary Filipino would have been bewildered by such a compliment. Bush may have been referring in directly to Marcos’s having lifted martial law on January 17, 1981, but by then Marcos had the mechanisms in place to maintain all the control he needed. His powers were as broad as ever: Amendment Six to the 1973 Constitution in stitutionalized one-man rule over the nation. With at least 1,000 decrees issued, the dictator could shape the different facets of Philippine society, whether this was the economy or the military, however he saw fit"

With at least 1,000 decrees issued, the dictator could shape the different facets of Philippine society, whether this was the economy or the military, however he saw fit. And in the elections held in June of 1981, which marked a return to the presidential system (but this time a system that in cluded the post of prime minister), Marcos won with 86 percent of the vote. With mainstream opposition parties boycotting the elections and with the regime controlling the electoral machinery as well as the press, the elections simply furnished Marcos’s prolonged stay in of fice with a legal veneer. Imelda: Holding Up Half of Heaven In 1954, she started out as the naïve wife of a brilliant politician, but by the time of martial law, Imelda had, through conscious determination and psychiatric help in New York City, remade herself into a powerful national figure. With martial law she metamorphosed into more than just a ceremonial First Lady. She had emerged a steel but terfly, as many called her simultaneously in awe and derision. Thus, the commonplace reference to His and Hers governments was right on target. She was no longer the darling of the masses who beat up the Beatles for turning down her in vitation to lunch at Malacañang. That hostility was made manifest on December 7, 1972, less than three months after martial law had been declared, when an assailant tried to stab her at a public event. The First Lady sustained cuts to her arms but survived the at tempt. The would-be assassin, Carlito Dimahilig, of whom nothing seems to be known, was shot to death by her security detail. In his Presidential Decree 731, on June 7, 1975, Ferdinand Marcos made Imelda head of the commission that would exercise power in the event of his death or in capacitation. He also appointed her governor of the newly created Metropolitan Manila District, a merger of four cities—in cluding the country’s two largest, Manila and Quezon City—and seven to wns. In 1978, not surprisingly, she won a seat in the Batasan Pambansa, or National Assembly. And that same year, she was named Minister of Human Settlements, a mega- agency with practically unlimited resources, endowing her with even more power as a dispenser of pork. She also served as the regime’s roving ambassador, moving easily from Egypt and Bolivia to China and Cuba. Imelda traveled with a large entourage, consisting mainly of women who came to be known as the Blue Ladies, usually the wives of in fluential men in military, economic, and political circles, and who the mselves became in fluential and wealthy. She acquired a reputation for world- class shopping, for which the term “Imeldific” was coined. Tiffany, Saks Fifth Avenue, and other tony establishments not just in New York City but in other capitals like Paris and Rome loved her, for she thought nothing of dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on one visit. Her extravagant taste in cluded choice real estate as well, and in the 1980 s she snapped up choice Manhattan properties, in cluding the prestigious Crown Building in midtown ($51 million) and the Herald Shopping Center ($60 million), catty corner from Macy’s department store. Her choice of residence while visiting Manhattan was a suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Like Ferdinand, Imelda was consumed by the pathological desire to remake herself, which meant reinventing her past to conform to a grander self-image. No telling or more extravagant monument testifies to this obsession than the Santo Niño (Holy Infant) shrine in the city in which she grew up, Tacloban—the very same capital where, in 1944, General Douglas Mac Arthur first announced to Filipinos that he had, as promised, returned. Built at a reputed $23 million in 1980, the huge two-story affair—part antebellum Southern mansion and part Spanish grandee’s home with Moorish arches—sits on a lot once occupied by a rather more modest dwelling that was young Imelda’s residence. The statue of the Holy Infant Jesus is ensconced in a ground floor chapel, flanked in congruously by guest bedrooms, each with a different motif. On the grand stairway leading to the second floor is a huge portrait of a gossamer-like Imelda, rising from the misty waters, an unmistakable reference to Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Upstairs are cavernous master bedrooms, with a reception hall complete with two thrones at one end. On the occasion of Pope John Paul’s 1981 six-day visit to the Philippines, the only predominantly Roman Catholic nation in Asia, Imelda or dered that fences be erected and whitewashed, to hide the in numerable festering slums of Manila the Pope would otherwise see. She had also planned the construction of an extravagant basilica, at a cost of a reported $100 million, with a 48-foot statue of the Holy Infant. Drawing heavy criticism even from the conservative Catholic hierarchy, the plan was abandoned. The First Lady had wanted the pontiff to stay at the Coconut Palace, a massive residence situated on the grounds of the Cultural Center, which had gold-plated bathroom fixtures and was built largely with materials derived from the coconut tree. John Paul turned down the in vitation, opting to stay at the Papal Nuncio’s of ficial residence. With Imelda leading the charge and despite other pressing and chronic needs, such as low-cost housing, the government built luxury hotels in an effort to promote to urism; added to the Cultural Center complex a gigantic 10,000-seat Folk Arts Theater to stage the 1974 Miss Universe beauty pageant; and constructed the Heart Center, in a country where malnutrition, rather than heart disease, is the most pressing health concern"

But it was in the hasty construction of the Film Palace—again, on the Cultural Center grounds—and the resulting deaths, which scandalized the public already in ured to the First Lady’s mania for oversized, unnecessary projects. The Film Palace was to be the primary venue for what Imelda had hoped would be in 1982 an in ternationally known film festival, one that would compete with Cannes and Tokyo. To make it in time for the festival opening, construction proceeded twenty-four hours seven days a week. As a result, a top floor collapsed when its cement foundation gave way, having not fully dried. Though the government has never said how many workers died, many accounts put the number at 169. The government tried to hush up the accident, but the tragedy was simply too large to escape unnoticed. It cast a pall over the festival proceedings, as rumors spread that the building was being haunted by the restless spirits of the dead workers. Exorcism rites were thus performed, to placate them. T HE C OSTS OF THE N EW S OCIETY Human Rights The Marcos regime stifled opposition, whether violent or not. From student activists to community or ganizers, from human rights advocates to academics, the sweep at the outset of martial law was broad and in discriminate, with approximately 30,000 people arrested. Most were citizens who had peacefully expressed their democratic right of dissent. The regime also cracked down on radio and television stations and shut down the in dependent press. One of its first moves was to confiscate the giant media conglomerate ABS-CBN, owned by the López family, a pillar of the old oligarchy. Fernando López had been Ferdinand’s vice president during his first term but had since fallen out of favor. The Lópezes’ media empire was too irresistible a target for the Marcoses and the new oligarchs. The suspension of civil liberties and the broad powers granted the military and the Philippine Constabulary led to systematic abuse, especially on the part of the constabulary, reprising its role as the main enforcer of American colonial rule. Amnesty International issued a report that stated four years after the declaration of martial law, the regime held at least 6,000 political prisoners, with to rture a routine method of in terrogating political dissidents. Female detainees were of ten sexually molested or raped. The most famous political prisoner was, of course, Senator Aquino, kept in solitary confinement. In Latin America the term desaparecidos, or “disappeared,” came to refer to unexplained, sudden disappearances and subsequent deaths at the hands of the authorities. In the Philippines, the equivalent term for extrajudicial killings was “salvaging,” paradoxically referring to a meaning opposite that of being saved or rescued. In the grisly parlance of the Marcos years, a person who was “salvaged” was someone summarily executed, with out any judicial proceedings whatsoever, the security and military for ces acting as judge, jury, and executioner. The body would be dumped usually where it was sure to be found, sending an unmistakable signal of how the regime treated dissidents. From 1973 to 1985, a human rights group, Task Force Detainees Philippines (TFDP), documented a to tal of 2,255 cases of such killings, with 334 disappearances between 1977 and 1983, where no corpse was ever found. One of the most notorious cases of salvaging was that of Macliing Dulag, a Kalinga tribal chief from the mountainous Cordillera region in northern Luzon. Dulag led a vigorous opposition to a proposed World Bank-funded Chico river dam that would have flooded ancient and sacred ancestral lands. Dulag was gunned down at this house on April 24, 1980—a date now commemorated as Cordillera Day. His death was not in vain, as the project was cancelled. In the countryside, the government created armed militias known as the Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs), which worked closely with the constabulary and army units. The CHDFs turned in creasingly violent, as well as corrupt. Adding to this volatile mix were fanatically anti-communist paramilitary cults, backed by the local military commands. These terrorized rural hamlets where in surgents, or their sympathizers, were thought to be hiding. To be seen as a collaborator with the NPA was in their eyes tantamount to a death sentence. Ironically, such cults had their roots in in digenous resistance to Spanish rule in the previous century, reacting both to state oppression and religious tyranny. In their twentieth-century in carnation, they now acted as unofficial agents of the state. With names like Pulajanes and Tad-Tad—a name that translates chillingly as “chop-chop” and suggests this particular group’s favored modus operandi— the cults appealed to disenfranchised and unemployed men in rural areas, men with little or no future. With the change to the more human rights-or iented Carter administration, pro-democracy activists believed a window of opportunity had opened. It had, but, disappointingly, only by a crack.

While pro-democracy activists were hopeful these meetings would be publicized, they were in fact low-key sessions, and no press photographers were allowed, for fear of of fending Marcos. The conference with Cardinal Sin was particularly disappointing since Sin and the other top Catholic prelates were untouchable, but Sin would not take the occasion to oppose one-man rule. He characterized his stance as one of critical collaboration with the Marcos regime. Observers felt, however, that the good cardinal was in fact more of a collaborator than a critic. As the Far Eastern Economic Review put it, “With rare exceptions, Sin has pretty much toed the line of the regime.” “Some Are Smarter Than Others” The first years of martial law saw a surge in economic growth, with an average annual rate of 7 percent, due mainly to an in crease in government revenue, in ternational lending, and to urism. New public schools were built, and massive in frastructure projects were undertaken that did improve highways and bridges. In particular, the Pan-Philippine Highway and the San Juanico Bridge—the longest bridge in the archipelago and spanning the straits between the islands of Samar and Leyte, Imelda’s home province—were held up as examples of the New Society constructively engaged in modernizing the country. Nevertheless, while immense wealth was being created, very little of it trickled down to the masses. By the end of the 1970 s, economic in dicators belied the rosy picture projected by government technocrats. Average monthly wages declined by 20 percent, with a 30 percent decline in agriculture and 40 percent in commerce. Prices for basic commodities such as cooking oil, rice, sugar and salt tripled. In 1971, the in come of the lowest 40 percent of families was barely 12 percent of the to tal; in 1981, this declined to 9 percent. In contrast, the top 10 percent earned close to 40 percent of the to tal in 1971; this rose to 42 percent in 1981. Dictatorial rule did nothing to narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots; on the contrary, martial law only made it worse. The percentage of people living below the poverty line in creased to 50 percent of the population by the time the Marcoses fled the country. Hence, the proliferation of slums in Metro Manila and other major urban areas, as the jobless and the homeless flocked to the big cities seeking work. It wasn’t only members of the low-end of the wage spectrum that moved abroad, seeking greener pastures. Professionals, such as doctors, nurses, and engineers, did too. There was a demand for contract labor in the Middle East due to petro-dollar-financed construction projects, while in the United States, medical personnel from abroad were recruited avidly, the domestic ranks of doctors and nurses being depleted by the demands of the Vietnam War. Thus began what is more commonly known as the “brain drain.” Increasingly, as a kind of mirror image of Japanese men going on sex to urs of the Philippines—a trade that was implicitly encouraged by the Department of Tourism—young women sought work as dancers and entertainers in the dimly lit yakuza- controlled bars and clubs of such cities as Tokyo and Osaka. (Both types of exodus continue to this day.) One major cause for the continuing slide into poverty for a majority of Filipinos was crony capitalism, where government projects became a cash cow not only for the Marcoses but also for their friends and relatives. While the regime had to a large degree broken up the old oligarchy and disbanded their private militias, it simply replaced the for mer with one of its own making, with its members for ming their own private militias. It was in deed a New Society—a society of new oligarchs drawn from the Marcoses’ respective clans and circle of friends. In 1979, Ricardo Manapat, a philosophy professor at a leading Philippine university, wrote a pamphlet that examined crony capitalism under the Marcos regime. The title Manapat gave it, “Some Are Smarter Than Others,” was based on a remark Imelda made when asked about the sudden wealth of certain relatives: “Sometimes, you have smart relatives who can make it…. My dear, there are always people who are just a little faster, more brilliant, more aggressive.” One of the most egregious examples of crony capitalism was the deal to build a nuclear power plant on the Bataan Peninsula, northwest of Manila. The construction of the plant, began in 1976, was envisioned partly in response to the oil crisis of the decade. But it was hardly a project a poor country could afford; nevertheless the regime went ahead with its plans. The site of the power plant raised alarming prospects of a nuclear meltdown, being situated near three earthquake fault lines and a then dormant volcano Mt. Pinatubo that would in fact erupt fiercely in 1991. The facility was also at risk from possible tsunamis from the nearby South China Sea. General Electric would have won the contract to build two reactors, with its bid of $700 million. However, Westinghouse managed to convince Herminio Disini—kin to Imelda by marriage, friend and golfing partner of Ferdinand—to in tercede on its behalf. Disini was persuasive and the contract was awarded to Westinghouse in stead. By then, the cost had escalated to $1.2 billion, the most expensive nuclear plant project in the world at that time. Though completed, it never got to operate and was shut down in the immediate aftermath of the Marcoses’ for ced departure in 1986. The Filipino taxpayer was, as usual, left holding the bag. Crony capitalism also reared its head in agribusiness, with the two most profitable cash crops—sugar and coconuts—coming to be monopolized by Marcos confidants and business associates"

Crony capitalism also reared its head in agribusiness, with the two most profitable cash crops—sugar and coconuts—coming to be monopolized by Marcos confidants and business associates. The enormous profits generated by consolidated control bankrolled the regional domination—political, judicial, social, and military—by these new oligarchs. In sugar, Roberto Benedicto, a fraternity brother of Marcos when both were law students at the University of the Philippines, called the shots, while in the coconut in dustry, it was Defense Secretary Enrile and businessman Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco (first cousin to Senator Aquino’s wife, Corazon Cojuangco). Through a tax on coconut production known as the coconut levy, the enormous amounts of money generated were then deposited in a bank specifically set up for this purpose, the United Coconut Planters Bank, or UCPB. Theoretically the bank and its assets were meant to serve the vast majority of coconut farmers who had small landholdings. Instead, the UCPB at the behest of its crony-dominated board set about acquiring a near-monopoly on coconut mills, the reby controlling prices for the processing of the nuts, which it set at below-market rates, and thus generating huge profits. Cojuangco used his position as Marcos crony and president of the bank—which had by the start of the 1980 s over $1 billion in levies—to not only amass personal wealth in the hundreds of millions of dollars but also buy controlling shares in the country’s largest food-and-beverage corporation, San Miguel, makers of the world-famous San Miguel beer. For those who benefited from crony capitalism, the days under the Marcoses were happy ones. They had tons of cash, all the luxuries they wanted, and power, as well as access to the ultimate dispenser of power: Marcos. He was the godfather, and his cronies (as well as Imelda’s) were the capos, who made sure that the godfather (and the godmother) received their share. They could operate with special dispensation from the government and were relatively immune from competition. Nevertheless, except in a few cases, crony businesses were in efficient in the long run, for cing the administration to bail out these compadre- run companies, in creasing deficit spending and, of course, for eign debt. The losses that resulted from corporations that closed were borne not by the cronies but by the laid-off workers, who had no assets stowed away in various banks, and ultimately by the average taxpayer. Rice Production and Land Reform Land has always been central to the lives of the rural folk, who for most of the country’s history have constituted the majority of the populace. Previous at tempts to reform the system so there would be land for the landless tiller failed, despite the high-flown rhetoric and the dramatic photo opportunities occasioned by public of ficials presenting land titles to a few lucky recipients. Marcos promised to be different. Shortly after the proclamation of martial law, he declared in no uncertain terms, “If land reform fails, there is no New Society.” His program did fail. There was no real New Society. Rather than challenging the prevailing class system through the New Society or eliminating the entrenched oligarchy, Marcos simply changed the main cast of characters but not the play. His land reform program was bound to fail because no sustained at tempt was made to implement it. More to the point, it left two-thirds of the country’s agricultural lands untouched—huge estates dedicated to cash crops, such as sugar, coconuts, and pineapple. A mere 1,500 tenants—0.5 percent of the supposed beneficiaries—had, by 1979, gotten titles to 0.3 percent of the land reform area. Moreover, coverage did not in clude such sectors as landless rural workers and tenant farmers working crops other than rice or corn. Other loopholes existed that provided the savvy landowner with ways of evading land reform legally. Small landowners and tenants were reluctant to participate. The for mer feared that they would not be fairly compensated. The latter knew that even if they were given land, they still had to shoulder new financial burdens, for farm to ols, fertilizer, seeds, etc. Government credit that was supposedly available was more of ten than not in sufficient. And of course borrowing from loan sharks simply in creased the chances of defaulting on their debts. In the end, the rural poor gained nothing from the supposed reform. One facet of the Marcos regime’s agricultural program was its emphasis on the in creased production of rice through the so-called Green Revolution. Through work at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in nearby Los Baños—established in 1960 and funded by the Rockefeller and Ford foundations —hybrid, high-yield varieties of rice were cultivated. The idea was that in creased production would lead to larger market sales and thus help alleviate poverty in the countryside. Marcos heralded the Green Revolution as a way of developing export agriculture and the reby in creasing for eign exchange reserves.

As a consequence, many lost their lands they had or iginally mortgaged to secure loans. Total land area devoted to rice declined by the beginning of the 1980 s. By 1985, the country needed to import 538,000 tons of rice. Rather than help resolve the land reform dilemma, the Green Revolution seemed to have exacerbated it. Additionally, the in come derived from export agriculture, while seemingly boosting GNP, was mostly kept by those of the elite who were close to the Marcos administration. Traditional moneymakers like sugar and coconut were controlled by powerful cronies such as Eduardo Cojuangco and Juan Ponce Enrile in coconut, and Roberto Benedicto in sugar, so that very little of those profits were ever seen by the small farmers. Other cash crops such as bananas and pineapple and for estry products proved to be hugely profitable as well, with the latter leading to an in crease in deforestation. With the overriding emphasis on monoculture, huge plantations reduced the availability of land for other crops. Sadly, workers laboring over fruit rarely if ever tasted the fruit of their labors. T HE I NSURGENCIES G ROW The New People’s Army Rather than discouraging the rebellious to lay down their arms, martial law bolstered the numbers of those taking to the hills to join the New People’s Army. The NPA had succeeded the Hukbalahap, having been co-founded by the disaffected young Huk fighter Bernabe Buscayno and by José Maria Sison, the most prominent dissident member of the PKP, the Huks’ parent or ganization. Both the Huks and the NPA emerged from the same region, Central Luzon, and both focused in itially on land issues: from tenancy and sharecropping to profit- sharing and the aimed-for breakup of the huge estates for their redistribution to peasants. The larger context—of having a more active say in how they were to be governed, principally—linked the NPA to prior movements fueled by agrarian unrest, such as the Sakdalistas, and most significantly, to the older revolutionary tradition of the Bonifacio-led Kataastasan Kagalagalangan Katipunan, or KKK. This time, however, a well-defined ideology—Mao’s in terpretation of Marxist- Leninist thought—shaped the direction and in ternal policies of the CPP and, of course, the NPA. Marcos proved to be the NPA’s most effective recruiter, albeit unwittingly. The crackdown on civil liberties and media; the roundup of student activists, or ganizers, and left-leaning urban professionals; the use of to rture; and the senseless salvagings for ced a generation of young men and women to go underground, whether this was within the cities or to the hills. The in fusion of a radicalized, educated, sophisticated middle-class segment, with networks all over the country, into the ranks of the CPP-NPA in vigorated the in surgency, hastening its emergence as a nationwide movement. In 1973, the National Democratic Front (NDF) sprang into being, as a number of left-leaning groups, such as the Christians for National Liberation (CNL) and the Cordillera People’s Democratic Front, saw the need for a coalition that would bring to gether similarly minded or ganizations and provide a channel through which progressive ideas about change could be disseminated. Due to its size and strength, the CPP/NPA dominated the NDF, rendering the latter in the view of the establishment a surrogate for the Communists. Even with Buscayno’s capture in 1976, and Sison’s in 1977, the NPA continued to expand. By the mid 1980 s, on the eve of the Marcos regime’s collapse, the NPA had guerrilla fronts in 63 of 72 provinces, and by 1986, when the conjugal dictators fled, its armed strength was estimated by the Philippine military at 26,000 regular guerrillas, a larger force of part-time irregulars, and a mass base of 2 million. Far more than the Huks, the NPA constituted a serious threat to the stability of the government. The Huks had been concentrated in Central Luzon and focused primarily on land redistribution. In contrast, the NPA operated nationally and sought to address a broader array of issues, from economic in equality and government corruption to the snail’s pace of justice. Able to fight on many fronts, the NPA had the capacity at times to field company-strength units of 200 to 300 men and women (unlike the MNLF, the NPA in cluded women fighters, and wholeheartedly believed in Mao’s dictum that women hold up half of heaven). According to a 1985 report issued by the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the “NPA in conjunction with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) controls or is contesting control of settlements in habited by at least 10 million people. The military in itiative clearly rests with the NPA.” The report went on to state, “NPA units nationwide now routinely at tack Government for ces…. Many NPA at tacks on military outposts are in tended to acquire weapons. By the end of 1983 the NPA claimed to have obtained 20,000 weapons, in cluding machine guns and grenade launchers.” Often, the CPP/NPA was the only government in the countryside in what were called “liberated zones.” The NPA had units that worked with local communities to build schools, and help peasant farmers. It also dispensed justice rather swiftly, if not always impartially—in contrast to the many local grievances that languished in the courts. Ideology may have shaped the thinking of top CPP and NPA leaders, but it was rarely, if ever, a factor in what motivated the rank and file"

The bitter experiences of having suffered in justices too long at the hands of an in different, even callous, landlord-dominated system—the rape of a daughter, say, or the murder of a father—and the desire to see their children lead much better lives prompted them to take up arms or serve the guerrillas in some other way. Until the government in Manila dealt seriously with the underlying causes, there would always be willing recruits for the underground struggle. The Moro National Liberation Front If the in tent of martial law was to tamp down the fires of rebellion, it failed miserably not just with the leftist in surgency of the New People’s Army but with the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF. Founded in 1972 by Moro activists prior to the declaration of martial law from a relatively quiescent or ganization known as the Bangsa Moro Movement, the MNLF aimed to create a separate state (the Bangsa Moro) consisting of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and the island of Palawan. The MNLF was headed by University of the Philippines professor Nur Misuari, a member of the Taosug tribe of Jolo. The struggle for in dependence and now secession had of course deep historical roots, going all the way back to the struggle with the Spanish colonizers. During the American colonial era the Muslim elite were wary of being part of an in dependent, Christian Philippines, and they expressed the desire to be some sort of U. S. protectorate. This sentiment was ignored, and in 1946 an in dependent Philippine Republic emerged that was constituted of Luzon, the Visayas, and all of Mindanao. One catalyst for the rapid rise in armed militancy among Filipino Muslims was the Jabidah Massacre of 1968. Young, able-bodied Moros in southern Mindanao had been recruited by the military and brought to Corregidor Island for training. There the recruits found out the real reason for their recruitment: as part of a secret elite unit, they were meant to foment disturbances among ethnic Tausug and Sama in the island of Sabah. Once British control of the island ended in 1963, it had become part of Malaysia. The Macapagal administration protested, saying that Sabah had been historically and was still part of the Sultanate of Sulu, and thus a part of the Republic of the Philippines. Marcos continued the suit but secretly planned the small-scale guerrilla war to strengthen his case. The Moro recruits, not desiring to fight fellow Muslims who furthermore hailed from the same ethnic groups, expressed their in tent to quit and return to southern Mindanao. Instead, on March 18, they were taken to a remote location on the island in small groups and machine-gunned. (The number of Moros massacred ranged from the government’s low estimate of twenty-eight, to the Moro National Liberation Front’s 200.) A survivor managed to escape to the mainland and tell his story, which outraged the Muslim communities and provoked a diplomatic firestorm with Malaysia that recalled its ambassador. The Jabidah massacre further radicalized Moro activists, one of whom was Nur Misuari. Compared to their Christian compatriots, Moros were poorer, less educated, with their areas suffering from in adequate in frastructure. Concentrated in Basilan, Zamboanga, the Sulu archipelago, and southern Mindanao, along with animist tribes, Moros—only 5 percent of the population then—generally were treated as second-class citizens and routinely discriminated against. Their few political representatives acted as traditional warlords and of ten were allied with powerful Christian politicians. To top it all, the wholesale migration of Visayan and Luzon homesteaders to Mindanao—billed as “The Land of Promise”—had been encouraged early on by the United States and in the 1950 s by Ramón Magsaysay. Christian settlers moving in and claiming Muslim communal and ancestral lands ironically replicated the process of land seizure their own for ebears had suffered at the hands of the Spanish and the principalia. Predictably, such resettlement engendered land and power disputes that in evitably led to violence. The Muslims had legitimate long-standing grievances, as the government, whether the legislature, the judiciary, or the military, was controlled by Christians. And Christians had started to form the majority population in many traditional Muslim areas—a clear threat to the Muslim political establishment. Animosity between the two groups led to both Muslim and Christian politicians for ming private armies. Those of the Christians were known as the Ilagas (a Visayan word meaning “rats”) while their Moro counterparts were called the Black Shirts, and, in one case, the Barracudas. Fighting between the two groups reached its height in the 1970 s, when the MNLF and the Philippine state were at war. The declaration of martial law in 1972 not only in tensified their struggle for power but was the spark that ignited the deadly conflict all across southern Mindanao, one that conflated a religious war with a civil one, albeit not on a national scale. Not only did the decree further consolidate power in Manila, a bastion of Catholicism, it delegitimized any anti-establishment activity. Above all, the Marcos regime’s at tempt to confiscate firearms from the private sector was further in terpreted as a move to leave the Muslims defenseless against the use of Christian-directed military force.

The MNLF was led by educated young men like Misuari who had studied either at Philippine universities or in the Middle East. They viewed the mselves through the prism of their faith rather than as Maranao, Maguindanao, or Tausug. Committed to changing the traditional patterns of wealth and power, they dissociated the mselves from the old-guard Moro politicians, most of whom they regarded as allied with Marcos. The MNLF leadership established contacts with Malaysian leaders and with Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi. Once martial law was declared and the at tempt made to seize firearms from Muslims, the armed phase of what had been a peaceful movement began. Malaysia, wanting to pay back Marcos for his botched 1968 at tempt, provided training for a select group of MNLF commanders on Sabah itself, the territory contested by both the Philippines and Malaysia. And, along with Libya, Malaysia provided arms and supplies, with Libya doing so through Malaysia. From late 1972 to the first half of 1975, the MNLF held its own against the AFP and even scored victories in conventional battlefield encounters. In the meantime, Misuari had gone into exile in the Middle East, where he continued to lobby oil- and cash-rich Arab states for material support. Both the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) were sympathetic to the MNLF’s cause, which received widespread in ternational coverage, fueling nationalist pride among Mindanao’s Moros. According to government estimates, at its peak, the MNLF had from 50,000 to 60,000 fighters, though more realistic estimates placed the figure at closer to 30,000. The in surgency in Mindanao cost the public treasury immensely while tying down more than half of the military’s combat units. By late 1975, the MNLF began to experience setbacks in the field. Battle fatigue had set in, and there were significant numbers of rebel surrenderees. Sabah’s titular politician and a strong supporter of the MNLF, Tun Mustapha, fell from power. By then, Marcos’s tactics of cooptation—of fering money and positions to local Muslim leaders—had had some success. Many Muslim politicians began to portray the mselves as moderates—nationalist and pragmatic at the same time. Too, Imelda used her diplomatic charms on key Arab leaders, especially Qaddafi, who had threatened the Philippines with an oil embargo. In negotiations in Tripoli with four member states of the OIC—Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Senegal, and Libya—in late December of 1976, the Marcos regime negotiated a ceasefire with the MNLF. The ceasefire provided both sides room to breathe and regroup, while negotiations were undertaken to work out the details of what would later be known as the Tripoli Agreement. The Tripoli Agreement represented a compromise between the Philippine republic and the MNLF. The latter now sought autonomy rather than in dependence while the Marcos government had to cede power to a region that it had long sought to dominate. Instead of the or iginal twenty-one provinces the MNLF had wanted to in clude, it had to settle for thirteen, eight of which had Christian majorities. The agreement stipulated that within the autonomous areas Muslims had the right to form their own schools, establish courts based on shariah or Islamic law, and create administrative systems, in cluding a legislative assembly, executive council, and its own security for ces. However, at an unspecified date, the MNLF men-under-arms would be in tegrated with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. While it seemed to hard-liners within the Marcos administration that he had given too many concessions to the Moro rebels, in fact, Marcos reduced pressure from the OIC and effectively took Libya, the MNLF’s strongest supporter, out of the equation. Most significantly a key provision in the agreement left its implementation to the Marcos regime. Despite objections from Misuari and the MNLF, Marcos determined that a plebiscite was needed to approve the creation of an autonomous region. The results? Ten of the thirteen provinces opted for autonomy. The Marcos regime then divided the ten provinces into two regions, making it easier to rule these areas even if grouped as one autonomous entity. In the meantime, Misuari’s leadership was challenged by his deputy Hashim Salamat, who resigned and for med a breakaway group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF. Educated at Cairo University and connected with Muslim reformers in the Philippines, Salamat was a more or thodox Muslim than the secular-minded Misuari and other MNLF leaders. Complicating the situation further was the emergence of the obscure Bangsa Moro Liberation Organization (BMLO), which claimed to represent traditional Moro society. Its leaders were old-school politicians, one of whom, Macapanton Abbas, had once served with the Marcos regime as government liaison to Moro districts.

It meant there were times when he was not in charge. Aquino feared a bloody struggle of succession would tear the country apart when Marcos died. Despite warnings from friends and from in siders within the Marcos regime, and a rendezvous with Imelda in New York City where she tried to persuade him to stay put, he flew via a circuitous route and under an assumed name, Marcial Bonifacio (a play on martial law, and the name of the military camp he had been detained in), to Manila and arrived on August 21, 1983. His at tempt at anonymity failed, nor did the bulletproof vest he wore protect him from a shot to the back of the head, killing him in stantly as he was being escorted off the plane by a government security detail, part of the Aviation Security Command. Ironically, had Aquino been allowed to deliver a speech upon disembarking, part of what he would have read stated that “the willing sacrifice of the in nocent is the most powerful answer to in solent tyranny that has yet been conceived by God or man.” Earlier, before he flew to Manila, he had said prophetically, “The Filipino is worth dying for.” A lone gunman and small-time gangster by the name of Rolando Galman, with no history of radical association with either the Left or the Right, was blamed by the government for Aquino’s assassination; conveniently, Galman was himself shot dead right after Aquino fell lifeless on the airport tarmac.

Thousands of mourners lined up to see Ninoy’s “salvaged” body, displayed in an open casket, the bloodied face left untouched by the funeral parlor, upon in structions from his bereaved family who wanted to show the world the regime’s calculated brutality. At least two million people lined the streets to watch the funeral cortege—an impressive and historic display of public grief, as well as an eloquent protest against the Marcoses, though the government-controlled media paid scant at tention. Ninoy’s martyrdom energized Philippine society and heralded the beginning of the regime’s end. While opposition from the poor and the left had always been a constant, what was new was the now active participation of the middle and upper classes in opposing the Marcoses. There was among them the growing feeling that if a member of the privileged class could be gunned down in broad daylight, no one was safe. Instead of passively holding, the center—whether in business, politics, or religion—moved actively into the ranks of the opposition. Massive street demonstrations became a regular feature of the urban landscape in Metro Manila. Revealing the depth of disenchantment with the Marcoses, the staid and normally apolitical businessmen and -women and white-collar workers of Makati—the country’s Wall Street—enthusiastically showered the marchers on the broad boulevards below with confetti and shouted anti-government slogans. The in sistent question was, “Who killed Ninoy?” It didn’t require a stretch of the imagination to see the hand of the military, if not the Marcoses, behind the foul deed. Under in tense domestic and in ternational pressure for an impartial in vestigation, Marcos dismissed the first in quiry commission, headed by a known Marcos partisan, and appointed one headed by Judge Corazon Agrava, respected for her in dependence. The Agrava Commission quickly threw out the lone-gunman the ory and, in late 1984, concluded what the public in stinctively believed, that the military escort had shot Aquino, and then shot and killed Galman. The Agrava Commission also determined that high-ranking military of ficers led by General Fabian Ver, Marcos’s relative and chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, had planned Aquino’s murder. Ver was famous for his unswerving loyalty to the dictator. The standard joke in Manila about the devoted Ver was that if Marcos asked him to jump from a building, Ver’s only question would be, “Sir, from which floor?” Marcos reluctantly suspended Ver prior to the for thcoming trial. In its Epilogue, the Agrava Commission in dicted the regime as well when it stated: … the killing of the late for mer Senator Aquino has brought into sharper focus the ills pervading Philippine society. It was this concretization of the horror that has been haunting this country for decades, routinely manifested by the breakdown of peace and or der, economic in stability, graft and corruption, and an in creasing number of abusive elements in what are otherwise noble in stitutions in our country—the military and law enforcement agencies. But after a sham trial before a special court, General Ver and twenty-four other high-ranking of ficials, and one civilian, were acquitted. Ver was quickly reinstated as chief of staff. Military support was absolutely essential if the Marcos regime were to weather the storm. In the end, only low-ranking soldiers received prison sentences. The predictable outcome of course further in flamed the public and triggered even more demonstrations. With the credibility of Marcos’s rule in shambles, and capital flight in tensifying due to the threat of a precipitous descent into chaos, the economy was in a tailspin. It was the deepest crisis in the history of the dictatorship, one that would bring it to its knees ultimately. The crisis had other effects"

With the credibility of Marcos’s rule in shambles, and capital flight in tensifying due to the threat of a precipitous descent into chaos, the economy was in a tailspin. It was the deepest crisis in the history of the dictatorship, one that would bring it to its knees ultimately. The crisis had other effects. For one thing, it spurred the rise of reformist elements in the military, notably the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM, a group of colonels, graduates of the Philippine Military Academy, that wished to rid the AFP of corruption, reinstill a sense of professionalism in the ranks, enforce a merit system of promotion—Marcos was notorious for his nepotism—and work for peaceful and legal change. Marcos’s in transigence further enlarged the ranks of the NPA and deepened U. S. domestic opposition to the Reagan government’s support of the dictatorship. U. S. policies to wards the regime began to change. What had been uncritical support now came under in tense scrutiny. Congressman Stephen Solarz, in fluential chair of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who had at tended Ninoy Aquino’s funeral, urged the Reagan administration to distance itself from the Marcoses. Adding his voice to the growing chorus of dissatisfaction was Senator Richard Lugar, head of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Filipino anti-Marcos groups in the U. S., from all across the ideological spectrum, grew more stringent in their criticism both of the Marcos dictatorship and the Reagan government. In public, the White House held on tight to the regime, but at the same time the State Department and the Pentagon made it clear that reforms were needed in the AFP, and that the U. S. needed to approach the legal opposition to canvass for a suitable replacement for the ailing dictator, a liberal who would also protect U. S. in terests. Marcos resisted the pressure to reform the military, as the leaders he had in stalled for med his main and, in creasingly, sole support. Nevertheless, in a bold and desperate ploy, on November 3, 1985, Marcos announced on the U. S. network television program, “This Week with David Brinkley,” that he would hold early presidential elections in January of 1986. It was an experienced lawyer’s calculated gamble, to cloak the retention of power in legality, somewhat mollifying U. S. critics but holding the very real threat of an upset win by the opposition. Because of the short notice, Filipinos referred to this as the “snap” election, later postponed to February. T HE S NAP E LECTIONS Corazon Cojuangco Aquino would be David against Goliath. A month after the strongman’s announcement on U. S. television, and presented with 1.2 million signatures, the widow of the slain senator agreed reluctantly to run against the aging dictator and the ruling Kilusan Bagong Lipunan (KBL). Salvador Laurel, heretofore also a presidential candidate, was persuaded to be her running mate, thus presenting a unified opposition field under the banner of the political party for med by Ninoy Aquino in 1978, the Lakas ng Bayan, its acronym being Laban, a Tagalog word which means “Fight.” (Ninoy had while in detention for med the party to oppose Marcos’s KBL in the 1978 National Assembly’s regional elections. All its 21 candidates lost in elections completely dominated by the ruling party.) During the campaign, Marcos confidently projected a landslide victory for himself and his running mate, Arturo Tolentine, questioning how a convent- educated housewife (an image both campaigns utilized for diametrically opposed reasons) could possibly cope with the numerous and complicated economic and security problems facing the nation. He contrasted his skills with Aquino’s lack of political experience, to which Aquino riposted that in deed, she lacked experience, especially in stealing and cheating. Hoping to placate the voters, Marcos dangled several carrots before them, such as reduced housing and utility costs, an in crease in government salaries, more schools, and tax breaks. A comic element was in troduced when Imelda belittled the widow’s lack of fashion sense and her preference for simple yellow dresses. (Yellow had become the opposition color, due to the yellow ribbons Filipinos displayed when her husband Ninoy was assassinated.) Part of the underlying tension between the two women, apart from the suspicion that Imelda had a hand in the plot to kill her husband, was due to class. Educated in exclusive schools at home and abroad, Cory Cojuangco Aquino was born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth, being a member of the immensely wealthy Cojuangco clan that owned Hacienda Luisita. Imelda Romualdez, on the other hand, had grown up in genteel poverty in the sticks and had clawed her way to the top while at tempting to erase the facts of her childhood. The fact that the snap elections pitted an aging tyrant and wily master politician against a saintly political ingénue who happened to be the widow of Ninoy Aquino, a martyr for his country, presented a spectacle fraught with symbols in a country with a fetish for symbols. The elections were a morality play, and a moro-moro, where good and evil were clearly delineated. It was a good old-fashioned cinematic melodrama, an eminently hissable villain with a harridan for a wife plotting against a betrayed mother—Cory doing triple-duty as the mother herself, the grieving widow, and stand-in for the mother country long suffering from abuse heaped on her by a wayward son and daughter. In Philippine iconography there are no more sacrosanct figures than a mother and a martyr’s widow: beneath the jock veneer laid down by the Spanish and the Americans, Filipino society is strongly matriarchal—one reason the most revered Catholic figures are representations of mother and child: the Virgin Mary and the Holy Infant Jesus"

During the campaign, the Marcoses vilified her gender, unwittingly galvanizing the women voters and betraying an ignorance of the Filipino psyche they claimed to know so well. In or der to protect their aggrieved mother, the people had no choice but to rise up against a brutal regime. Part of the opposition strategy was to urge the public to boycott the goods and services of companies owned and operated by Marcos cronies. Still, the Marcoses and the KBL held all the aces, and no one expected the elections to be a walk in the park for Cory. But a major revelation that seriously undermined whatever credibility Marcos had left was the fact that the twenty- seven medals supposedly awarded to him for his World War II heroics were fake. He was reputedly the most-decorated combat veteran of that war, second only to Audie Murphy, who went on to become a Hollywood star. (Marcos was also rumored to have an anting-anting, or amulet, embedded in his back that rendered him and his guerrilla unit impervious to harm.) During his tenure as chair of the Philippine Senate Appropriations Committee, for in stance, Marcos received no fewer than ten medals in 1963. But research by war veteran Colonel Bonifacio Gillego and in vestigative pieces in The New York Times and The Washington Post, based on archival research done by the historian Alfred Mc Coy, debunked Marcos’s claims to a storied war-time career. The guerrilla unit that he supposedly led, Maharlika, was of little value. Predictably, Marcos labeled the revelations part of a “smear campaign.” He claimed that Maharlika had 8,300 members and had performed valiantly under his leadership. In reality most of the exploits were figments of his imagination, and the guerrilla unit had approximately one hundred members, with no major feats accomplished. As early as 1948, after a thorough in vestigation, the U. S. military dismissed Marcos’s claims that he and his outfit had helped hasten the end of the war and concluded that Marcos’s false war claims amounted to a criminal act. Additionally, the records showed that Marcos had been arrested during the war for financial fraud. He was held but a short while before being released, an in dication that the young politician-on-the-make was already well-connected. In anticipation of the fact that the Marcoses would pull out all the stops to cling to power, the National Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL, was revived. NAMFREL had its or igins in the early 1950 s, created with CIA funds for the campaign of Ramón Magsaysay. In limbo during the martial law years, it was resurrected in 1983 and headed by an anti-Marcos entrepreneur, José Concepción Jr. It would compete with the government’s Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and provide a quick count of the ballots, to preempt the shady practice of most Philippine elections, dagdag-bawas (“add and subtract”), wherein tabulation is rigged to favor one party (usually the one with the most resources) over the other. In fact, the administration did at tempt to manipulate the overall tallies at the main COMELEC tabulation center, prompting a walk- out by COMELEC operators to protest such blatant cheating. Most of NAMFREL’s funds for the 1986 election came from such U. S. sources as the Agency for International Development, the National Endowment for Democracy, as well as from the Japanese government and American businessmen living in the Philippines. NAMFREL also helped support the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, and Radio Veritas, the church-owned radio station that would play a key role in the February 1986 People Power uprising. The Left Is Left Behind The fast-moving developments caught the radical left unprepared. Before Marcos sprung the idea of a snap election on the nation, a coalition of various left-wing opposition groups had for med in early 1985, calling itself Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, the New Nationalist Alliance, or BAYAN, for short, an acronym that means “nation” in Tagalog. Taken to gether, its constituent or ganizations provided a base of two and half million people. While affirming the need to depose the Marcos regime, and after much in ternal debate, in January of 1986 BAYAN opted to boycott the elections, a decision it would later rue. It issued a statement that read in part: There is no sense believing, the refore, that the snap election shall lead to the ouster of Marcos from power. In truth, it shall only for tify the U. S.-backed Marcos dictatorship…. The snap election does not promise meaningful changes in Philippine society … unless the electoral campaign can be transformed into a militant forum for advancing the anti-dictatorship struggle, the snap election shall be entirely meaningless…. In view of the for egoing, the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan deems that the people are left with no other principled option but to boycott the snap election. Some of BAYAN’s leaders felt they were missing an unprecedented opportunity to move their agenda for ward, and took a leave of absence from the or ganization, campaigning for Aquino. Other left-wing groups not allied with BAYAN also supported the elections and Aquino, arguing that she had spoken out against the retention of the U. S. bases; had promised the release of political prisoners if elected as well as amnesty for all those charged with political of fenses by the regime; and would draft a new constitution to replace the Marcos-era one.

Aquino then proposed meeting with the ailing dictator to effect a smooth transition of power, a proposal speedily turned down. For his part, trying to project a more neutral tone, President Reagan encouraged Marcos to work with his opponents to transform the political system —as though dictatorial rule since 1972 could so easily be changed. The U. S. president seemed to be in denial, however, when at a press conference shortly after the Marcos camp had of ficially declared its man the winner, he expressed his concern “about the violence that was evident there and the possibility of fraud, although it could have been that all of that was occurring on both sides.” His loyalty to the Marcoses couldn’t have been clearer. At the same time it in furiated the Filipino voters. U. S. Congressman Stephen Solarz sarcastically noted that the Reagan response was “evidence that the White House has been transformed into an opium den … [T]hey’ve clearly lost to uch with reality.” To the Reagan administration Marcos was a known entity, America’s Boy, whom different U. S. administrations had supported for twenty years. It found it difficult to envision a transition that would actually in volve the mass participation of Filipinos taking to the streets to oust the dictatorship— democracy in its rawest form. And that is precisely what occurred between February 22 and February 25, when a military coup about to fall flat on its face succeeded when the aroused citizenry of Metro Manila rallied around the rebels and for ced the Marcoses to flee. Marcos’s security for ces had gotten wind of a coup being planned by the RAM leaders, who were close to Enrile and Fidel Ramos, head of the Philippine Constabulary (and a relative of Marcos to boot). The RAM group in turn learned of or ders being issued for their arrest on February 22, prompting them, with Enrile and Ramos, to move to two military camps, Aguinaldo and Crame, that same day, with their followers. Abandoning his largely in effective stance of so- called “critical collaboration” with the regime, two days before the elections, Cardinal Sin had declared that Catholics could practice civil disobedience if they believed the elections to be fraudulent. No one doubted that it was an endorsement of Aquino. And it was Sin who, through Radio Veritas, exhorted listeners to come out onto the streets surrounding the two camps where the anti- Marcos for ces had holed up, and which faced each other across the broad lanes of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, or EDSA, in Quezon City. People Power, as it came to be known, was nothing short of a fairy tale come true. Unfolding over a period of four days, from February 22 to 25, at least a million citizens from all walks of life for med a human shield around the camps, an unprecedented display of the unarmed and the unnamed facing down the armed and dangerous. Beggar, priest, nun, matron, businessman, student, market vendor stood in the path of pro-Marcos tanks and assault troops, of fering them flowers and food, and exorcising the helicopter gunships overhead with their rosaries, crucifixes, and cheers. It was awe-in spiring, a modern-day Cecil B. De Mille spectacle and a hippie dream come true: a bloodless revolution, a war of the roses sans thorns, and a miracle all rolled into one, which would in spire similar miracles in Berlin, Moscow, Tiananmen, and Prague. At one point, against her handlers’ advice, Cory Aquino proceeded to one of the camps and told the cheering throngs there that “for the first time in the history of the world, a civilian population has been called to defend the military.” That it would also herald, albeit unknowingly, the restoration of the ancien régime was at the moment scarcely evident. The urban populace, and the country—for similar outpourings occurred in other cities—had succeeded in for cing the Marcoses to seek refuge in Uncle Sam’s arms. On Tuesday, February 25, at 10:46 a. m., Corazon C. Aquino was sworn in as President of the Philippines at the Club Filipino in the upper-class enclave of Greenhills, the first woman to lead the nation. Addressing Filipinos as her “beloved brothers and sisters,” she declared: “It is fitting and proper that, if rights and liberties of our people were taken away at midnight fourteen years ago, the people should recover those lost rights and liberties in the full light of day…. It took the brutal murder of Ninoy to bring about a unity so strong and the phenomenon of people power. We became exiles in our own land—we Filipinos who are at home only in freedom—when Marcos destroyed the Republic fourteen years ago.” Not to be outdone, Marcos also proclaimed himself president on the same day, from a balcony in Malacañang, surrounded by his family and a coterie of faithful “loyalists,” as these die-hard Marcos followers came to be known. By then he had already been persuaded by U. S. Senator Paul Laxalt to resign. Laxalt, when asked by the dictator what he should do, had replied: “I think you should cut and cut cleanly. The time has come.” Offered asylum in the U. S., later that same day, he, Imelda, their family, and a few close friends were flown by helicopter to Clark Air Force Base, the nce transferred to a plane that took them to Honolulu. Among the conjugal dictators’ luggage were $200,000 in gold bullion, $1 million in pesos, and Pampers boxes crammed with jewelry that in cluded a gold crown and three tiaras of precious gems. Those heady February days not only signaled a new level of political consciousness—however temporary that may have been in hindsight—but resurrected and extended the collective stirrings of nationalism generated by the 1896 revolution against Spain—Asia’s first against a colonial power"

We became exiles in our own land—we Filipinos who are at home only in freedom—when Marcos destroyed the Republic fourteen years ago.” Not to be outdone, Marcos also proclaimed himself president on the same day, from a balcony in Malacañang, surrounded by his family and a coterie of faithful “loyalists,” as these die-hard Marcos followers came to be known. By then he had already been persuaded by U. S. Senator Paul Laxalt to resign. Laxalt, when asked by the dictator what he should do, had replied: “I think you should cut and cut cleanly. The time has come.” Offered asylum in the U. S., later that same day, he, Imelda, their family, and a few close friends were flown by helicopter to Clark Air Force Base, the nce transferred to a plane that took them to Honolulu. Among the conjugal dictators’ luggage were $200,000 in gold bullion, $1 million in pesos, and Pampers boxes crammed with jewelry that in cluded a gold crown and three tiaras of precious gems. Those heady February days not only signaled a new level of political consciousness—however temporary that may have been in hindsight—but resurrected and extended the collective stirrings of nationalism generated by the 1896 revolution against Spain—Asia’s first against a colonial power. Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos desired more than anything else to be seen as great historical figures but wound up being, sadly, merely hysterical and much-ridiculed characters. The Deluge The night of the 25 th, anti-Marcos crowds that had gathered by the gates of the palace burst through, overwhelming the loyalists who had stood guard. Long denied access to the palace, they ran through the corridors of power, partly in glee and partly in astonishment that they had even been able to penetrate the in ner sanctum. They could have easily plundered and like Visigoths ransacked Malacañang but, perhaps mindful of history, did relatively little damage, except for some paintings of the couple that were defaced, furniture damaged, and various knickknacks taken as souvenirs. That the president was seriously ill was evident in the mini-clinic that had been set up with sophisticated medical equipment, cabinets full of vitamins and medications, disposable diapers, and a dialysis machine. In the basement two hospital rooms had been set up, one of them clearly meant for surgery. Imelda’s quarters bore quantifiable evidence of her mania for expensive items—a never- ending at tempt to fill the needs of a deprived childhood. Her mirrored dressing room was filled with hundreds of costly silk dresses, baskets crammed with soaps from around the world, and row upon row of expensive French perfumes. Elsewhere were a half-dozen wide-screen television sets, stereo units, and a double freezer full of frozen steaks. In her bedroom stood a ten-foot high closet packed with her nightgowns. Underneath her twelve-foot-wide bed, according to the late journalist and National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin, were bundles “of gold-chain necklaces and a receipt for over two million dollars from the jewelers Van Cleef and Arpels…. Mrs. Marcos’s private bathroom was equipped with a 15-foot-square sunken bathtub, mirrored ceilings, gallon bottles of a custom-made French perfume called First Lady. And no fewer than five Italian bathrobes…. A tally would reveal that Imelda left behind three thousand panties, three thousand pairs of shoes, hundreds of black bras [one of which was bulletproof], and five fur coats, in cluding minks.” S HE R EIGNS B UT D OES N OT R ULE Corazon C. Aquino, or Cory to the public, was an unlikely president, with no experience of holding or even running for political of fice. She was, in short, not a trapo, an acronym for tra ditional po litician and a pun on the Tagalog word that means “rag.” Her non-trapo status was a major reason for her immense popularity at the outset of her term. A conservative Catholic and a member of one of the richest Chinese-mestizo clans of the country, the Cojuangcos, she had been educated in the United States, studying mathematics and obtaining a degree in French at the private College of Mount Saint Vincent in New York City. Her presidency began auspiciously enough, with a repudiation of the 1973 Constitution and the abolition of the legislature. By claiming legislative powers for her of fice, she had de facto established a revolutionary government. In effect, Aquino could rule by decree, just as Marcos had. Unlike the Marcos regime, however, President Aquino and her administration encouraged the creation of what the media referred to as “democratic space” by taking several measures, such as the restoration of the writ of habeas corpus; leaving the courts free to operate once more with out executive or any political in terference; the repeal of repressive Marcos-era labor laws; the establishment of a commission, headed by respected for mer senator and political prisoner José Diokno, to in vestigate those responsible for human rights abuses under the Marcos dictatorship; and the convening of a constitutional convention to replace the 1973 document with another constitution. The long-suppressed frustrations, aspirations, and exuberance of the public found release when more than twenty dailies sprung up, in cluding the revival of the two venerable English-language newspapers, The Manila Times and the Lopez-owned The Manila Chronicle. What had begun as an anti-Marcos tabloid, Mr. & Mrs., in corporated with the weekly Philippine Inquirer to become the Philippine Daily Inquirer two months before the to ppling of the Marcos regime. It soon became the largest-circulation English-language daily in the nation. To deal with local of ficials that had come to power during the Marcos era, the Aquino administration simply replaced them with temporary of fice-holders, known as Officers-in-Charge, or OICs. It was a sweeping act, perhaps too sweeping, resulting of ten in throwing out the baby with the bath. Critics pointed out that, while it was true there were many who had been mere mouthpieces of the Marcos KBL machine, not all were political hacks or in competent; many had won legitimately and enjoyed popular support.

For a while, democratic space resulted in a détente, albeit uneasy, between the military and both the Communist New People’s Army, and the secular Moro National Liberation Front. In recognition of their struggle against Marcos, political prisoners were released, the most prominent being the NPA head, Bernabe Buscayno, and the CPP founder, José Maria Sison, much to the dismay of hard-liners within Aquino’s Cabinet and the military. Sison, who had spent nine years in prison and had endured to rture, was a much-sought-after speaker by various civic and university groups, before leaving on a speaking tour of Europe. He decided to seek asylum in the Netherlands in 1987, after being warned by friends that returning to the islands would be detrimental to his health. Buscayno and several other members of the left or ganized a political party Partido ng Bayan (Pn B, Party of the Nation) to campaign for congressional seats in the 1987 elections. Forming a coalition with other cause-or iented groups that called itself Alliance for a New Politics, Pn B disdained the traditional palabas for its election rallies and appealed to the electorate on the strength of their progressive platform. Hampered by a shoestring budget, the Pn B slate of senatorial candidates, in cluding an ex-beauty queen turned guerrilla, fared poorly. And in a sign that democratic space was viewed as a charade by extremist right-wing groups, Buscayno survived an assassination at tempt, though two companions were killed and shrapnel permanently lodged in his back. Buscayno credited his in stincts as a guerrilla, which he said enabled him to in stinctively get down on the floor of the automobile he was in when shots rang out. Two other well-known Pn B candidates led less charmed lives and were assassinated: Lean Alejandro, a young, charismatic for mer student activist at the University of the Philippines and Rolando Olalia, an important left-wing labor leader and or ganizer. Nevertheless, the left viewed the post-Marcos democratic space as an opportunity to test new ideas and approaches. The NPA negotiated with the government for a sixty-day cease-fire while the CPP allowed for more vigorous in ternal debate, mindful of its costly blunder during the snap elections. Undertaking self-criticism of its boycott position, in its publication of May 1986, Ang Bayan, the leadership was contrite: “Where the people saw in the February 7 snap presidential election a chance to deliver a crippling blow on the Marcos regime … the Executive Committee of the Party Central Committee saw it merely as ‘a noisy and empty political battle’ among factions in the ruling classes. And when the aroused and militant people moved spontaneously but resolutely to oust the hated regime last February 22-25, the party and its for ces were not there to lead them.… A recent assessment conducted by the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the Central Committee characterized the boycott policy as a major political blunder.” The debates within provoked in ternecine struggles, as the leadership at tempted to define its policies and chart new directions in the post-Marcos era. The underground left’s image of solidarity was further undermined by revelations that in the waning years of the Marcos dictatorship, the NPA conducted bloody purges of its ranks in Mindanao. Seized by a vengeful paranoia, and with reports of government agents having in filtrated their ranks, NPA commands executed a number of their own, suspecting them to be, in their parlance, “deep penetration agents.” The movement was further shaken with arrests of top CPP figures in 1988, the result of much-improved military in telligence, aided undoubtedly by dissent within the CPP/NPA. Extending the same olive branch to the MNLF, the Aquino government allowed exiled MNLF leader Nur Misuari to return. The military and many impartial observers viewed this as a tactical mistake, for the MNLF was moribund and Misuari’s return revived it; the for mer university professor was hailed practically as a conquering hero when he went on tour of southern Mindanao, with a large and impressive heavily armed entourage. Casting aside the arrangement made during the Marcos era, another plebiscite was held in 1989, with the aim of creating an autonomous region for Filipino Muslims, as or iginally envisioned by the Tripoli Agreement. This time around, only Basilan, Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi out of thirteen provinces voted to be part of what was to be called the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), to be governed by Misuari. That Misuari accepted the holding of a plebiscite and the resulting geographical area that was much smaller reflected both the fact that the MNLF was not as potent as before and that the years in exile had made him more realistic in his and his or ganization’s aspirations. Recovering the Loot As early as 1969, the CIA determined that Marcos had already stolen several hundred million dollars, and, by 1972, other American of ficials had become aware that Marcos was raiding the national treasury. Nothing was said, however, to avoid embarrassing an ally. Estimates of how much the Marcoses had stolen from the government ranged from $5 billion to $10 billion. Due to the unwelcome spotlight placed on its secretive banking practices, the Swiss government promised to freeze all Marcos accounts even as the Aquino government, using documents seized that linked the Marcoses to numerous bank accounts and major expenditures, determined to recover at least $6 billion in assets it accused the Marcoses of unlawfully amassing.

To take charge of the recovery efforts, the Aquino administration set up the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). The PCGG itself however became mired in charges of corruption and of in dividual of ficers turning sequestered corporations into their private fiefdoms. The most publicized at tempt to recover the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses was the trial of Imelda in New York’s federal district court in May of 1990. (Ferdinand had died in 1989, so his widow had to undergo the humiliation of a public trial alone, a trial monitored closely by the PCGG.) She had been in dicted the year before, with the government charging her and Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi arms dealer alleged to have helped the Marcoses in their financial shenanigans. The four-count racketeering in dictment centered on the purchase of four choice Manhattan buildings with cash illicitly acquired—a crime under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, the scope of which in cludes pursuing criminal enterprises that operate outside the jurisdiction of the United States when part of the ill-gotten profits are then in vested or otherwise used within the U. S. The act was or iginally meant as a key legislative bill aimed at or ganized crime syndicates such as the Mafia. The trial lasted three months, the government prosecutors portraying the complexities of the case that in cluded 95 witnesses, 5,700 pages of testimony, and 300,000 documents of fered to the court as possible evidence. Prosecution witnesses painted a damaging portrait of money laundering of huge sums from the Philippines, cronyism, kickbacks from local and for eign businesses, as well as extravagant purchases that in cluded jewelry and artworks. In the end, however, the jury acquitted Imelda and Khashoggi on all counts—on July 3 rd, her 60 th birthday, no less—testament to Imelda’s lawyers’ persuasive use of the blame-the-dead-man defense, and to the prosecution’s in ability to present a coherent and convincing picture of sustained criminal activity. To celebrate her acquittal, Imelda, throughout the proceedings the very picture of the demure and retiring widow, proceeded immediately to St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, not far from the Crown Building, one of the four properties her family was believed to have owned. Surrounded by photographers and a coterie of loyalists, she made her way on padded knees to the altar and of fered thanks to the Almighty and, presumably, to Ferdinand for his in tervention from beyond the grave. Democratic Space versus Military Restlessness Marcos may have fled the country, but thousands of his supporters remained visible and voluble, taking advantage of the restoration of civil liberties to constantly criticize the Aquino administration. Barely two months after the February uprising, on April 12, twenty thousand Marcos supporters gathered on the streets of Manila and demanded his return. Though pro-Cory supporters had turned out as well, it was a peaceful if raucous demonstration, with the two sides kept apart by the police. The loyalists would stage such scenes sporadically during Aquino’s tenure, but they were never a serious threat to her government’s stability. The most pressing threat the Aquino government faced, with its unlikely coalition of centrists, left-wingers and right-wingers, was from the military, now rechristened New Armed Forces of the Philippines, a public- relations ploy meant to in dicate that men in uniform were now more at tuned to a democratic society. It was a new military, not in the sense of having a renewed dedication to professionalism and respect for civilian rule but in the fact that the AFP was now disturbingly aware of its ability to take an active role in governance. Marcos of ten rewarded of ficers by assigning them to head non- military government agencies. With military expenditures becoming the biggest item of the national budget, the top brass had acquired a taste for the material benefits brought about by corruption, thanks to Marcos’s coddling of the generals he needed to prop his regime up. The discipline and professionalism that Magsaysay had in stilled in the ranks when he was dealing with the Huk rebellion had all but disappeared. Politicized, the military had grown from a pre- martial strength of 50,000 to 250,000 at its peak during the Marcos era and was no longer content to confine itself to the barracks. Henceforth, it would be impossible to put the genie back into the bottle. The two leaders of the aborted 1986 coup against Marcos that led ultimately to People Power, Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel V. Ramos, held powerful posts in the Aquino Cabinet. Enrile was kept on as defense secretary while Ramos was appointed chief of staff of the AFP: Insiders in the Marcos regime, they were now in siders in the Aquino government. Neither Enrile nor Ramos had any love for the Communists or the Moro rebels or any group that professed similar ideals. Additionally, RAM of ficers were lobbying for more of a say in running the government, through both Enrile and Ramos and their demands on how President Aquino was to govern. The military hardliners felt passionately that with out their support Cory would not have at tained the presidency, and they of ten reminded her of her debt of gratitude, her utang na loob, to them.

A general amnesty was proclaimed for NPA guerrillas, and many did come down from the hills, giving up their arms and at tempting to take up the civilian life once more. On November 24, 1986, a sixty-day ceasefire was agreed to by the government and the CPP/NPA. The day prior, Enrile had been sacked by Aquino; the defense secretary had made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Aquino’s policies and openly voiced his sympathy with military malcontents. In early 1990, the government had him arrested on charges of rebellion and murder but the for mer defense secretary easily beat the charges. Enrile’s in ability to accept Aquino’s leadership proved symptomatic of the unusual restiveness afflicting the military. One military of ficer likened Aquino’s conciliatory efforts to “castration.” In all there were seven at tempts to to pple her government, all ending in failure, primarily due to Ramos’s fidelity to Aquino. Nothing showed the in fluence of the hardliners within the administration more than the way the first coup at tempt was dealt with. On July 6, 1986, civilian loyalists and about 300 soldiers, in cluding some generals, took over the historic Manila Hotel. Arturo Tolentino, who had been Marcos’s last vice president, stood on the hotel driveway and declared himself acting president. That it was a farce more than anything else was perhaps in dicated by a quip uttered by Manuel Collantes, Tolentino’s ersatz minister of for eign affairs: “For me, the revolution ended as soon as room service stopped.” Assured by Defense Secretary Enrile that “we are not out to humiliate, punish, or embarrass any of you,” the soldiers gave up and the loyalists, most of them from Manila’s rougher neighborhoods, left the premises. So as not to be seen as letting them off too lightly, Ramos or dered the military miscreants to do thirty push-ups—with him joining in. A telling in dicator that the military seemed to be operating beyond Aquino’s control was in January of 1987. Government security for ces fired into the ranks of farmers, student activists, and laborers, who were marching on Malacañang to demand genuine land reform. Thirteen protesters lost their lives and thirty-nine were wounded. The bloody in cident came to be known as the “Mendiola Massacre,” referring to the nearby bridge that had also been the contested site of the 1971 First Quarter Storm. In protest, the head of the Commission on Human Rights, ex-Senator José Diokno, and his deputy resigned the day after. The killings further undermined popular support for Cory—and ate away at the space her government had been granted by the underground left. The cease-fire with the NPA ended the month after the massacre, in early February 1987, when the CPP ruled out any extension. In turn, adopting a harder line and bowing to pressure from the army, Aquino called for a “to tal war” and declared that only victory, not compromise, would end the in surgency. Six more coup at tempts followed. One, staged on August 28, 1987, was led by Colonel Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan, a handsome and charismatic leader of RAM and a veteran of the counterinsurgency wars in Mindanao. The coup failed, and Honasan was arrested. But because of the widespread sympathy he had in the military, as well as with a large segment of the public that viewed him as a romantic freedom fighter, he escaped easily and continued to plague the Aquino government. Indeed, his hand, and that of RAM, could be seen in the most serious coup at tempt yet, on December 1, 1989, when 3,000 troops, spearheaded by elite units such as the Scout Rangers and the Marines, targeted Makati, the prime financial district of the country, and the site of exclusive gated communities and high-rise luxury hotels. The rebels for ced the closing of the airport (now named the Ninoy Aquino International Airport), commandeered two TV stations, and occupied military outposts through the metropolitan area. Aquino’s government survived after President George H. W. Bush or dered U. S. jets to fly over the city and signaled to the rebels that the United States would shoot down any rebel aircraft. The nearly successful week-long grab for power resulted in 190 dead and close to 600 wounded. It cost the economy an estimated $1.2 billion and dampened for eign-in vestor confidence that had been rising steadily since 1986. With Aquino in power and perceived to be sympathetic after all to U. S. concerns, Washington stuck to the same goals it had had for nearly a century: the preservation of U. S. military and economic in terests for which it was willing to oppose any popular movement that might undermine those in terests. It continued to encourage Aquino to deal with the in surgency through military means, reduce or eliminate the leftists in her government, allow for the retention of the bases, and further encourage free enterprise. One more sign that the Aquino government was reverting to Marcos-era policy when it came to the seemingly in tractable in surgency was its approval of the military-created, Orwellian-sounding Citizen Armed Force Geographical Units (CAFGUs). It was simply the CHDF of the Marcos regime being given a new name, with essentially the same responsibility: to augment regular army units in counterinsurgency work in areas where the NPA was believed to be operating. Fidel Ramos, now the defense secretary, oversaw their creation. Not surprisingly, the CAFGUs proved to be as problematic as the CHDFs had been, with complaints about their abusive behavior being filed with disturbing regularity with the Commission on Human Rights. The Aquino government’s in creasing emphasis on military solutions to the in surgency and away from economic and social reform meant a resumption of the army’s dirty war, whose victims were mainly civilians"

S. military and economic in terests for which it was willing to oppose any popular movement that might undermine those in terests. It continued to encourage Aquino to deal with the in surgency through military means, reduce or eliminate the leftists in her government, allow for the retention of the bases, and further encourage free enterprise. One more sign that the Aquino government was reverting to Marcos-era policy when it came to the seemingly in tractable in surgency was its approval of the military-created, Orwellian-sounding Citizen Armed Force Geographical Units (CAFGUs). It was simply the CHDF of the Marcos regime being given a new name, with essentially the same responsibility: to augment regular army units in counterinsurgency work in areas where the NPA was believed to be operating. Fidel Ramos, now the defense secretary, oversaw their creation. Not surprisingly, the CAFGUs proved to be as problematic as the CHDFs had been, with complaints about their abusive behavior being filed with disturbing regularity with the Commission on Human Rights. The Aquino government’s in creasing emphasis on military solutions to the in surgency and away from economic and social reform meant a resumption of the army’s dirty war, whose victims were mainly civilians. According to the human rights group, Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), by 1988, the army was responsible for 54.7 percent of human rights violations, and that in Aquino’s first 1,000 days, 11,911 persons were arrested for political reasons, mainly in slum areas and rural communities, by the police or the military; 1,676 in dividuals were subjected to to rture; and 705 people were salvaged. In 1987, according to Amnesty International, more than 100 left-wing political activists, trade unionists, and peasant or ganizers were assassinated either by the military, paramilitary units, or vigilante groups supported by the military. Old Lamps for the New In May of 1986, President Aquino decreed the establishment of a constitutional convention, the third in a little more than half a century, to replace the martial- law-era 1973 Constitution. Those appointed to draft the new constitution were mainly from the upper class, in cluding for mer legislators, judges, and politicians. One convenor was the in ternationally known film director Lino Brocka, who was from a working class family and known for his landmark social-realist melodramas that had bedeviled Imelda Marcos, whose vision of cinema was largely defined by works such as The Sound of Music, one of her favorite films. She believed Filipino cinema should be a repository of the “good, the beautiful, and the true” and that it should make people elsewhere want to be Filipinos. In this light, social realist films were a no-no. But precisely due to repressive policies, the 1970 s and early 1980 s were a golden age for Filipino films, when a whole slew of filmmakers—in cluding Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, Marilou Diaz, Eddie Romero, Mike de Leon, Peque Gallaga, and Tikoy Aguiluz—created works that challenged government control and were in sightful critiques of contemporary Philippine society. Brocka resigned before the final version of the constitution was drafted, charging that the convention seemed in tent on restoring the old guard, one that had been displaced by the Marcoses, rather than in corporating much-needed reforms. He felt that the working-class and the peasantry were hardly represented, if at all. To him, it was the Malolos Congress once again, dominated by society’s elite. And in deed, the proposed constitution—ratified in February of 1987— adhered closely in many respects to the 1935 model, with the switch back to a presidential system (but this time, with only a single six-year term) and a bicameral legislature. Voters could once again elect a president and a vice president from different parties. A human rights commission was created, a bill of rights in corporated, and checks placed on authoritarian rule. There were however at least three significant differences. The first had the Constitution providing for party-list representation, a concession to those who, like Brocka, had criticized the convention for excluding the less for tunate from its framers. The party-list feature allows for legislative representation for under- represented segments of society, such as the urban poor, women, labor, peasants, and in digenous communities. Voters in each Congressional district can cast two votes: one for a district representative who will represent the constituents, and the other for a party-list or ganization, which has a national platform rather than a local one. If a party-list group obtains at least 2 percent of the to tal votes cast nation-wide, it then lands a seat in Congress, with a maximum of three seats. This system first went into effect with the 1998 national elections, when thirteen party-list or ganizations won seats. The new constitution also mandated making the country nuclear-free, as long as this was “consistent with national in terest.” But the most significant difference relative to Philippines-U. S. relationship now elevated any agreement between the United States and the Philippines regarding the fate of U. S. bases to treaty status, which meant it was subject to ratification by the Philippine Senate. During her presidential campaign, Aquino had been in favor of terminating the bases’ lease. It was one way of establishing her nationalist credentials and distinguishing herself from Marcos. Once she had ascended to the presidency, however, and faced with constant pressure from the U. S., hard-liners within her cabinet, and the military, she changed her tune, saying merely that she wanted keep her options open. An in terim bases agreement was drawn up in late 1988 after seven months of negotiations, with Secretary of State George Shultz and Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus signing for their respective governments. The United States agreed to pay $481 million for the bases over two years. At the end of this in terim agreement, the Senate would then decide the fate of the bases. And on September 16, 1991, with nationalist solons, particularly those with the Liberal Party, carrying the day, the Senate rejected the treaty. It was a momentous occasion, a cause for celebration among all those who believed that the presence of U. S. soldiers on Philippine soil, begun in 1898, demeaned the country’s sovereignty.

The practical effect would only be on Subic Bay Naval Base, for earlier that year, Mt. Pinatubo had erupted spectacularly, after six hundred years of dormancy, effectively shutting down Clark Air Force Base. The Economy The Marcos government’s programs, which relied heavily on in ternational lending agencies, had in creased the country’s external debt to $28.5 billion, giving the country the dubious distinction of being among the ten most in debted countries in the world. Overspending on the elections, crony capitalism, bureaucratic corruption, and the flight of capital that in tensified after Senator Aquino was assassinated left the state coffers drained. In the last five years of the Marcos regime, per capita in come fell by close to 20 percent, and the prices of basic commodities had risen in an in flationary spiral that threatened to go out of control. As a result, poverty levels rose, with close to 60 percent of the rural population living below the poverty line. In Metropolitan Manila alone, 1.5 million families were similarly afflicted. With an average population growth rate of nearly 3 percent, poverty levels were sure to in crease even more, straining barely adequate government resources and services. This rendered the dilemma facing the Aquino government—how to service its external debt—an acute one. As elsewhere in other Third World countries facing enormous debt, some segments of Philippine society argued that the debts in curred under the Marcos regime should be repudiated, as these benefited his cronies more than the country, and financed projects that should never have been undertaken. Aquino’s minister of economic planning, Solita Monsod, made a strong case for this, within the larger context of achieving social justice and reducing the yawning in equities between the haves and the have-nots. Cardinal Sin argued as well for selective debt repudiation; to do otherwise would be “morally wrong,” given the penury of the people and the country. A case in point was the Bataan Nuclear Plan, which had been mothballed. Daily in terest payments alone amounted to $300,000. But the neoliberals within her cabinet, primarily Jaime Ongpin, her in fluential and respected finance minister, and Central Bank Governor Jobo Fernandez in sisted that the nation meet all its external obligations. Default was not an option, they argued, if the country wished to remain a credible part of the global financial market. This meant payments of $3.5 billion a year, or 10 percent of the GDP. At the end of the day, Ongpin, Fernandez, and their allies convinced the Aquino administration to borrow even further, thus allowing in ternational lending agencies such as the International Monetary fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank to help shape the government’s economic policies. The strategy in essence was that through in creased borrowing the economy would be stimulated, which would in turn in crease revenues that would then drive down the debt. It was also a precondition to approval of the $10 billion Multilateral Aid Initiative (MAI), primarily backed by the United States, as well as Japan and other creditor nations. It was a precondition similar to the strings-at tached aid that the U. S. extended to the spectacularly ruined country right after World War II. Combining payments on both for eign and domestic debt during Aquino’s tenure ate up almost 50 percent of government revenues—leaving little for in frastructure, poverty alleviation and other social programs, and education. Poverty levels did decline somewhat, from close to 50 percent down to 46.5 percent, but this was nowhere close to significant. Beginning with the Marcos years, when the export of labor overseas was actively promoted, remittances from the expanding Filipino diaspora helped soften the blows of a stagnant economy. During Aquino’s six-year term, remittances averaged $4 billion a year. That figure has risen in the first decade of the twenty-first century to close to $16 billion. The Failure of Land Reform A major cause of the in surgency has always been the in equitable distribution of agricultural land. More than a quarter of arable land was owned by less than four percent of land-owning families. The desired end was simple—to break up huge, landed estates—but the means to that end were not. Making land transfers work meant fair compensation for the owners and setting up a whole government network of financing and farm-production distribution. Where was the money to come from? More importantly, would the landed families, long a part of the historical ruling elites, agree? While the 1987 constitution recognized the need for “an agrarian reform program,” the specific provision was less than compelling: To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental or equity considerations, and subject to payment of just compensation. In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the rights of small landowners. The State shall further provide in centives for voluntary land sharing. Instead of using her emergency powers to in terpret the constitution and apply far-reaching changes with regards to land reform, Aquino deferred to the newly elected Congress. By allowing its members to set the “priorities and reasonable retention limits,” she essentially left it to a landlord-dominated body to legislate against its own in terests. It wouldn’t and didn’t"

By allowing its members to set the “priorities and reasonable retention limits,” she essentially left it to a landlord-dominated body to legislate against its own in terests. It wouldn’t and didn’t. The clearest and most eloquent in stance of the failure of Aquino’s land reform program lay in the fact that Hacienda Luisita, her family’s huge 6,000-plus hectare hacienda, where the family’s racehorses received better care than the tenant laborers, remained in tact. She had promised in her campaign that the hacienda would be affected. There was a nominal at tempt to in corporate the hacienda so that it became the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated, with 33 percent of the stock to be turned over to the tenant farmers, but over a period of thirty years. The Cojuangco family would retain the rest of the stock. In the end, Cory was unable, or unwilling, to act against the in terests of her clan. By the time her Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program had metamorphosed into the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, it had lost much of its bite. Instead of more than 27 million acres being subject, only 9.4 million acres would be affected. There was a corresponding decline from 3 million farmer-beneficiaries to fewer than 2 million. And most significantly, no sugar and coconut lands were to be subject to land reform, essentially leaving most of the major agribusiness plantations untouched. Land-owning lawmakers, and lawmakers beholden to wealthy landowners in their districts, heaved a sigh of relief in private even as they publicly praised the law as a landmark. Such emasculation made it possible for Congresswoman Hortensia Starke, a wealthy, prominent sugar planter from Negros Occidental and outspoken opponent of land reform, to walk dramatically through the Congress session hall in July of 1988, clad in an expensive ball gown and twirling a parasol—a clear “I don’t give a damn” in the face of the popular clamor for land. What She Hath Wrought The problems facing Corazon C. Aquino when she took of fice were seemingly in numerable, in tractable, and multilayered. Viewed as a manager and administrator, she seemed helpless, nowhere more so than in the energy sector. With no coherent and sustained policy, regular blackouts plagued residential and in dustrial areas, driving up the cost of doing business in the country and discouraging potential in vestors. Infrastructure was left to deteriorate. And the economy, after rebounding in the first two years of her term, started to decline. Poverty levels thus remained substantially high. A major factor in the continuing high levels of poverty was her administration’s commitment to paying in full the country’s for eign debt, essentially continuing Marcos’s policy of automatically appropriating from the national budget the full amount to service the debt due each year. As a result, from 1986 to 1993, according to economist Walden Bello in a 2009 article for the Philippine Daily Inquirer examining her economic legacy shortly after her death that year, “some 8 to 10 percent of the Philippines GDP left the country in debt-service payments adding up to a to tal of nearly $30 billion—an appalling sum, especially considering that the Philippines’ external debt was only $21.5 billion.” In contrast, Bello pointed to Argentina’s President Norberto Kirchner who, in 2002, confronted with bankruptcy caused in the main by debt repayments, decided to repay only 25 cents out of every dollar owed. In spite of in itial resistance from the creditors, they eventually agreed, and Argentina, able to reduce capital outflow, “grew by an average of 10 percent between 2003 and 2008.” While the more in sidious forms of crony capitalism were discontinued, as were the monopolistic mechanisms for sugar and coconut, Aquino’s government didn’t quite know what to do with all the corporations the Marcos regime had controlled, either through heavy subsidies or outright ownership. Through the Assets Privatization Trust under the management of the PCGG, at tempts were made to sell off these assets, at tempts complicated by legal wrangling, in ternal disputes, and allegations that the PCGG itself was becoming corrupt. Complicating and rendering the process of governance even more difficult was a military that always seemed on the verge of taking over—a threat that kept the Aquino administration off balance throughout and discouraged for eign in vestment. And there was the old guard, the pre-martial law oligarchy, slowly reinserting itself into power, and reviving their for tunes (both political and financial) that had been put on hold by the Marcos regime. What began seemingly as a revolution wound up as a restoration. Be that as it may, Cory Aquino did mediate a peaceful transition to a post- Marcos era, a housewife turned midwife. Free speech, an of ten licentious press, courts liberated from the yoke of executive in terference: all were hallmarks of the democratic processes she had revived, along with the centrality of the ballot box.

The President needs to persuade the military that its reputation and effectiveness will be enhanced rather than undermined by acknowledging the facts and taking genuine steps to in vestigate. When the Chief of the AFP contents himself with telephoning Maj-Gen Palparan three times in or der to satisfy himself that the persistent and extensive allegations against the General were entirely unfounded, rather than launching a thorough in ternal in vestigation, it is clear that there is still a very long way to go.” —From a press statement by Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions; Manila, February 21, 2007 S TEADY E DDIE A GRADUATE OF W EST P OINT AND A CAREER MILITARY MAN, President Fidel V. Ramos (1992-98) had seen combat as a platoon leader during the Korean War and from 1966 to 1968 headed the non-combat Philippine Civic Action Group in Vietnam. Steady Eddie, as he was called by many for his seemingly unflappable disposition particularly during the tumultuous years of his predecessor as president, was from Pangasinan Province in northern Luzon and was on his mother’s side second cousin to Marcos. In 1972, Marcos appointed Ramos to head the Philippine Constabulary, the agency primarily entrusted with enforcing martial law and many of whose units were blamed for the profligate abuse of human rights committed while Marcos ruled as a dictator. Though Ramos must have at the very least known of such abuses, he somehow avoided the taint of criminalization. Whatever taint there may have been was washed away by his helping to lead (along with Enrile and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement) the successful People Power uprising against the regime. In his capacity as Corazon Aquino’s chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and later on, as the secretary of national defense, he helped save her administration from seven coup at tempts. No one was surprised then that she endorsed him to succeed her as president. Aquino herself had steadfastly refused to run and continue on as president, even though the one-term limit set by the 1987 constitution did not apply to her since she ascended to power in 1986. Whatever the shortcomings of her administration, and there were many, she herself was held in high public regard. A political ingénue at the outset and a reluctant ruler, Aquino possessed an in nate decency and modesty, shunning the extravagance that had been the signature of the Marcoses, especially Imelda, choosing, for in stance, to live in the presidential guest house rather than Malacañang proper, to symbolize the difference between her and her immediate predecessors. She had a calm demeanor, underneath which lay a steely resolve that stood her well during the tumultuous years of her presidency. With no allegations of personal corruption— though the same could not be said of her family—she was a saint in the eyes of the public. Her endorsement of Ramos thus carried considerable weight. Not only were there presidential elections in 1992, there were elections for every government position in the country, in cluding municipal councilors. Congress had decided the previous year that both local and national elections were to be held at the same time, on the same day. An astonishing eighty thousand candidates vied for more than 17,000 seats. Twenty-three years after the last freely held presidential elections, Filipinos trooped to the polls. Ramos, a Protestant, won, in spite of the Catholic Church hierarchy coming out against him, and with barely a quarter of the vote but enough to edge out the six other candidates, in cluding Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco, one of Marcos’s closest cronies and Cory Aquino’s estranged cousin, who had returned quietly in 1989. Senator Joseph Estrada, from another party, for mer movie action star and an unabashed Marcos loyalist, secured the vice-presidency by a wide margin, positioning himself as likely the next president once Ramos’s term was up. The 1992 elections reflected the rather stark fact that the glory days of the two-party system were over. Before martial law, one belonged either to the Nacionalistas or the Liberals, with affiliation based more on political convenience than on party platforms. True, the Nacionalistas and the Liberals participated in these elections—Vice President Salvador Laurel for the for mer and Senator Jovito Salonga for the latter—but they fared poorly. There were other parties now, such as Marcos’s Kilusan Bagong Lipunan (New Society Movement), Lakas ng Tao (People Power), Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Hope for a Democratic Philippines), National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD), and the People’s Reformed Party. Ramos had for med Lakas ng Tao, and allied it with the NUCD as well as with an obscure party, the United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines. These post-Marcos political parties were however no more distinct from each other as the Liberals had been from the Nacionalistas, the or iginal Tweedledum and Tweedledee of Philippine politics. Philippines 2000 As all presidents before him, Ramos promised change. Marcos had his New Society; Ramos came up with “Philippines 2000.” By the millennium, he wanted the country to join the ranks of the newly in dustrialized countries and thus be an Asian tiger as well or, at the very least, a cub. He envisioned a strong state, as he put it in his 1993 State of the Nation speech, “that can assert our country’s strategic in terests because it has relative autonomy over the in fluence of oligarchic groups…. We have had a political system that has been too responsive to groups possessing wealth and power enough to bend the State to their will. Such a political system has distorted our economy and rendered government in effectual.” Under Ramos, the manufacturing of export goods was accelerated and the economy further deregulated to at tract more for eign capital. Civil aviation, shipping, telecommunications, and the oil in dustry, for example, were subjected to deregulation. Export-processing zones were established in designated strategic areas, where for eign firms could set up shop with less stringent government controls, create thousands of new jobs, and stimulate the local economies of the region they were located in, whether in Metro Manila, Baguio City in northern Luzon, or Cebu—the latter the business hub of the Visayas, where the surge in the economy, accompanied by an accelerated real estate development, came to be known as “Ceboom.” The Ramos administration continued the dismantling began by the Aquino government of both state-owned enterprises and monopolies"

One of its biggest success stories was in facilitating the availability of telephone lines to consumers. Telecommunications had long been dominated by the Cojuangco- owned Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. It wasn’t uncommon for a family to wait years before a line could be had, and even then it might be shared with another family—referred to commonly as “party line”—leading either to frostiness on both ends or a live-and-let-live accommodation. With deregulation, competition markedly in creased so that, by 1996, at least thirteen companies provided service and at favorable rates. Ramos also hastened decentralization began under Aquino, decreasing state bureaucratic power in favor of stronger local governments, with a corresponding in crease in their share of government revenues. But Ramos’s Philippines 2000 was conditioned on economic development models largely used by the affluent West but that would not necessarily translate well in a developing Third World country. In a sense, it was a one-size-fits-all plan that came at the expense of agriculture—the traditional base of the economy and source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos—and burgeoning in dustries that concentrated on self-sufficiency, one that disregarded in digenous culture and traditions. The free-market export-or iented approach was encouraged by in ternational lending in stitutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank—and opposed by nationalists, hard-line Marxists, and various nongovernmental or ganizations, especially those that provided social services to the poor in lieu of failed or nonexistent government programs. Too, the Western model favored by technocrats had arisen ironically due to historical factors such as colonialism and the corresponding systematic exploitation by the colonizers of the colonies’ natural wealth and resources. The native comprador class and the elites benefited hugely, the concentration of wealth among their ranks a major reason why a vigorous middle class never emerged. To follow such a model blindly then would in effect make the country a party to its own continuing exploitation. Government corruption however proved to be as deeply rooted and as in tractable as before. As much as 45 percent of pork-barrel funds for lawmakers wound up in their personal accounts. President Ramos himself conceded that at least twenty percent of the government budget was siphoned off due to corruption. This was, for in stance, glaringly evident in the shoddy state of in frastructure in many provinces, where stretches of paved road alternated with barely passable ones and where bridges damaged by typhoons of ten took an in or dinate amount of time to repair. Age-old hurdles remained the same: too many people lived at poverty level, and lacked access to safe water, basic health care, and decent housing. Government economic policies were conditioned on the classic trickle-down premise, the idea that a rising tide lifted all boats. Unfortunately, the rising tide of ten swamped smaller, rickety boats. Triggered by speculation, a severe economic crisis afflicted Asia in 1997 and threatened to lead to a global one. Sudden devaluations undermined several Asian currencies, particularly those of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, and Indonesia, and led to a subsequent in crease in for eign-debt ratio to GDP. While the Philippine economy was hurt—growth in 1998 was near zero—it wasn’t as hard hit as its neighbors, being that the country still hadn’t been that well in tegrated into global financial markets. Efforts by the Ramos government to stabilize the peso by unloading as much as $4.5 billion depleted for eign reserves but did prevent the peso from a drastic free fall. Domestic enterprises that relied on imports cut back and laid off workers, causing a surge in unemployment. On the other hand, depreciation of the peso helped boost exports, which narrowed the trade deficit. And the remittances of the overseas workers, amounting to almost $6 billion, provided a much-needed financial cushion. Thus, the country emerged from the 1997 crisis a bit bloody but unbowed. In 1999, the economy rebounded and grew by more than 3 percent. Contributing to President Ramos’s growing reputation as a capable manager was his handling of the energy crisis and the in efficient water supply system that had long plagued Metro Manila. Power outages, known as brownouts and sometimes lasting as long as twelve hours in smaller cities, were so regular during Aquino’s term that they were a national embarrassment. Energy shortfalls averaged 1,000 megawatts daily. Demand had far outstripped supply; the nation’s power plants were too few and antiquated. The need for businesses to purchase generators added considerable expense to their overhead. Such deficiencies in the power in frastructure discouraged potential for eign in vestors. In response, the Ramos government, granted emergency powers by Congress, issued licenses to in dependent contractors to construct power plants, with the proviso that these were to be up and running within 24 months. By 1994, the power crisis had been almost completely resolved. Only one problem remained: power was available but the rates were the second highest in the region, with Japan taking the lead. Japan, however, was the world’s second-largest economy. Similarly, Ramos moved to deregulate the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System, the government body charged with providing potable water to Metro Manila’s ever-expanding population. By 1992, the National Capital Region (Metro Manila’s of ficial designation) had close to 10 million residents"

By 1992, the National Capital Region (Metro Manila’s of ficial designation) had close to 10 million residents. The system in place had been built during the American colonial era, suffered extensive damage during World War II, and had never really been repaired fully, let alone upgraded. Through financing arranged through the World Bank, four firms—two for eign and two local—committed $7 billion to improving and modernizing the system. The New Heroes Despite improvements in the economy, the exodus of workers for employment overseas continued unabated. In 1996, for example, over a six-month period, according to the Philippine government’s National Statistics Office, the number of registered workers going abroad for employment, or Overseas Filipino Workers, was 900,000. By 1999, that figure had reached 1,043,000. According to a 2007 cover story by Jason De Parle in The New York Times Magazine, in 2006 the exodus was enough to fill six 747 planes daily. Of the population of 92 million, approximately 10 percent live abroad, with Filipino workers scattered throughout 170 countries. The article noted, “There are a million O. F. W. s in Saudi Arabia alone, followed by Japan, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan.” The largest segment of the diaspora was and continues to be in the United States, where close to 4 million Filipinos live. Abuse of overseas Filipino workers, especially of domestic workers, has been a recurring problem. Two cases made the front pages and dramatically illustrated how life abroad for these women (for most if not all domestic workers were women) was fraught with not only alienation and loneliness, but physical danger as well. Later, the stories were to form the basis of two critically acclaimed Philippine feature films. The first case in volved Flor Contemplacion, a middle-aged domestic worker in Singapore who was accused of murdering another Filipina domestic and drowning the child in the victim’s care in 1991. Contemplacion was eventually convicted of the murders in 1995 and sentenced to die by hanging. However, two Filipina witnesses came for ward with evidence purporting to show that Contemplacion had been framed for the murders. According to them, the child had in advertently drowned in a bathtub and the father had been so in censed by his son’s death that he killed the nanny and then framed Contemplacion. The Singapore courts considered the evidence proffered but decided to let the conviction stand. Contemplacion was hanged despite President Ramos’s plea for clemency. Her death became a cause célèbre, with the city-state’s punitive act sparking numerous demonstrations against Singapore in Manila and other Philippine cities. The Philippine for eign Secretary resigned and the ambassador to Singapore was recalled, with Ramos suspending diplomatic relations between the two countries. Ramos had referred to Contemplacion as a Bagong Bayani, or a “New Hero,” an unambiguous recognition that the monies sent to the Philippines by OFWs were essential in keeping the economy afloat. The term became part of standard government rhetoric when referring to overseas workers. Such rhetoric aimed to defuse public wrath at Malacañang’s perceived in eptitude and powerlesness when it came to protecting its own citizens abroad. (From time to time, the government honors the returning overseas workers with a red-carpet reception at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and a chance to win cash prizes.) The Contemplacion case speeded up the enactment later that year of the Migrant Workers Act by Congress, in tended to recognize overseas workers’ rights and outlining specific steps to protect these rights. A few months after the hanging of Contemplacion, in September 1995, another Filipina domestic worker, this time in the United Arab Emirates, was convicted of stabbing her employer thirty-four times and killing him. Sarah Balabagan, a fifteen-year-old Muslim Filipina, claimed self-defense as the man, having raped her once, was at tempting to do so again. After two trials, she was found guilty of premeditated murder, with the second court ruling that there was no evidence of rape. After a plea from the UAE’s ruling sheikh, the late employer’s family agreed to accept payment of blood money—donated by a wealthy Filipino businessman—a year’s imprisonment, and one hundred strokes of a cane. According to Balabagan, the dead man’s family cheered at each stroke of the cane. In 1996, the young woman was deported to the Philippines. That year alone saw 14,000 complaints of abuse filed with the government’s Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. Contributing to the ever-pressing need for jobs, with the resultant unceasing exodus for greener pastures overseas, was the high rate of population growth. One major reason top Catholic prelates in the country had stood against Ramos was not simply because he was a Protestant, but that he might promulgate government policies aimed at lowering the country’s birth rate. In contrast, the convent-bred President Cory Aquino, known in for mally as a Catolica cerrada (literally, a closed Catholic), devout and deeply conservative, had essentially ignored the population problem. During her term, annual population in crease was 2.35 percent. (It had declined to 2.04 percent by 2007—still one of the highest growth rates globally. By 2050 the population is expected to exceed 150 million.) Aquino’s conservatism reflected the local Catholic hierarchy’s own. In 2003, Cardinal Sin’s responded flippantly when queried by The New York Times about the fast-growing population: “The more the merrier.” The church steadfastly opposed curbing the population growth through condoms and other artificial contraceptives, which it condemned as immoral, favoring in stead the rhythm method or abstinence"

To show that he was serious about family planning, Ramos appointed Dr. Juan Flavier, also a Protestant, as secretary of health. The doctor had been the president of the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction as well as the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement and had acquired a no-nonsense reputation when he worked as a doctor among the poor barrios of Cavite and Nueva Ecija provinces, witnessing the difficulties of a subsistence life, compounded by the lack of family planning. He proved to be a colorful, plain- speaking physician who had no qualms about shaking up the Catholic hierarchy’s obstinate refusal to consider contraceptives as morally legitimate to ols for dealing with unwanted pregnancies. Flavier would himself of ten distribute condoms to popularize the need for reducing the country’s population growth. At the end of Ramos’s term, the annual population in crease of 2.35 percent under Aquino was lowered closer to 2 percent. The Post-U. S. Bases Era The bases treaty had been rejected in the last year of Cory Aquino’s term. Five months after Ramos took of fice, on November 24, 1992, Subic Bay Naval Base ceased to be American territory. (Clark Air Force Base, as noted in the previous chapter, had been effectively shut down even before the Senate vote, due to Mt. Pinatubo’s cataclysmic eruption and the subsequent heavy damage Clark suffered.) A contingent of U. S. Marines prepared to depart as the Stars and Stripes was lowered, permanently drawing the curtains on U. S. occupation of the base that began in 1899. As President Ramos remarked, “There has been no day that for eign troops were not based on our soil,” with for eign military presence finally ending after more than four hundred years. Part of the Ramos administration’s ambitious plan for modernization in volved converting the for mer Subic Bay Naval Base into a free port, a regional hub where for eign corporations could take advantage of the facilities left behind by the United States. These in cluded in dustrial warehouses, power plants, residential housing, a 9,000-foot runway, and even a golf course. Within the vast complex were a 5,000-acre watershed area and a 10,000-acre rain for est, whose resident in digenous tribe had for decades taught jungle survival skills to U. S. soldiers. The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) was created in 1992, after the U. S. with drawal, to oversee development and to make sure that the looting, of ten in collusion with local military units, that had stripped Clark Air Base bare would not be repeated. President Ramos appointed the mayor of Olongapo, Richard Gordon, as the SBMA head. The with drawal of the U. S. troops had adversely affected the region’s economy; Gordon had actively campaigned for the retention of the bases. Now he proved up to the challenge of recasting the baselands as the major component of a revitalized economy. Security was tightened, volunteers from Olongapo City were in itially recruited to help maintain the site, and the rain for est and watershed areas protected from poachers and illegal logging. The centerpiece of the redevelopment was the Subic Special Economic and Free Zone, slated to in clude in dustrial parks, a ship and maritime center, to urism, a financial center, and private businesses. By 1996, Gordon and his staff were able to convince more than 200 companies to in vest over $1.2 billion in Subic. Among these companies were Federal Express, Enron, Acer (a Taiwanese computer firm), and Hutchinson Whampoa, a Hong Kong shipping company. Gordon would later parlay his success and win a Senate seat in 2004, the reby positioning himself for a future presidential run. One thing the SBMA and the United States military did little or nothing about was the environmental pollution at Subic. Over the decades, the United States military personnel produced tons of hazardous and to xic wastes, absorbed into the ground, dumped into the bay, dispersed through the air, and buried within landfills. These to xic wastes posed very real dangers to base workers and the mostly poor villagers who lived along the base’s perimeter—dangers that in cluded exposure to asbestos, low-level radiation in the waters due to nuclear- powered vessels (a threat to marine ecosystems), and unexploded or dnance—this last has caused some deaths and severe in juries among scrap metal scavengers. Of five million gallons of wastewater emptied into Subic Bay daily, only a quarter was treated, with lead and other heavy metals drained from ship-repair facilities directly into the bay. A 1992 U. S. General Accounting Office study of environmental problems at Subic listed three major health hazards: PCB contamination, to xic lead and other hazardous substances, and fuel and chemical leakage into the soil and groundwater. The report also ment ioned the presence of the lethal poison pentachlorophenol and the to xic metal lithium. The GAO report noted that “at the time of our review, the Air Force and the Navy had no plans to clean up at these sites.” Nor did the 1988 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two countries of fer any legal recourse. On the contrary, it absolved the United States of any responsibility. It stated: “The United States is not obligated to turn over the bases to the Philippines at the expiration of this agreement or the earlier relinquishment of any bases in the condition in which they were at the time of their occupation.” There were social costs as well"

Of five million gallons of wastewater emptied into Subic Bay daily, only a quarter was treated, with lead and other heavy metals drained from ship-repair facilities directly into the bay. A 1992 U. S. General Accounting Office study of environmental problems at Subic listed three major health hazards: PCB contamination, to xic lead and other hazardous substances, and fuel and chemical leakage into the soil and groundwater. The report also ment ioned the presence of the lethal poison pentachlorophenol and the to xic metal lithium. The GAO report noted that “at the time of our review, the Air Force and the Navy had no plans to clean up at these sites.” Nor did the 1988 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two countries of fer any legal recourse. On the contrary, it absolved the United States of any responsibility. It stated: “The United States is not obligated to turn over the bases to the Philippines at the expiration of this agreement or the earlier relinquishment of any bases in the condition in which they were at the time of their occupation.” There were social costs as well. Olongapo and Angeles cities were well- known rest-and-recreation havens, particularly during the Vietnam War, when approximately a million servicemen passed through. The brothels, bars, massage parlors, and other related businesses took in $135 million a year. Out of the countless liaisons between the men and the bar girls, an estimated 50,000 mixed- race childen were born. Most were abandoned by the fathers, their care and upbringing left to their impoverished mothers and a few social agencies. Dealing with the Army During Ramos’s six years in power, the military was quiescent. Its restive elements, such as RAM, could hardly complain now that one of their own was at the helm. Ramos was a career of ficer, a veteran, and one of the principals behind the ouster of Marcos. Though he stood firmly by Aquino’s side while his brothers in uniform tried to oust her, he never came down unduly hard on the miscreants. To further demonstrate his fraternal solidarity, in 1995 Ramos granted blanket amnesty to military rebels in volved in various coup at tempts. (The amnesty may have backfired. One of those pardoned was Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan, one of the founders of RAM, who was in volved in the various coup at tempts against Aquino. In 2003, Honasan, already a senator—he had won in 1995 and 2001—was once again a prime suspect in a failed coup at tempt on July 27 against the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Implicated by the mutineers, the senator vowed to clear his name. He was implicated yet again in another at tempt in 2006, for which he was arrested and held at a military camp. In early 2007, a regional trial court cleared him of any in volvement with these failed coups. He ran for reelection in May of 2007 and won.) But if military malcontents ceased to plot against civil government under Ramos, nevertheless the army and the Philippine National Police (the result of a merger between the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police in 1991), along with the auxiliarly militia Citizen Armed Force Geographic Units (CAFGU), continued to be accused of perpetrating human-rights abuses against labor activists, religious personnel, journalists, community or ganizers, and their supporters in both city and countryside. Often, those arrested were framed for crimes they did not commit; being in jail as a common criminal rather than a political detainee posed considerable difficulties for human rights or ganizations working on their behalf. One type of genuine criminal activity that did see an upsurge between 1993 and 1997 was kidnapping, with wealthy Chinese Filipinos the favored target. The abductions were usually carried out with military precision. Not surprising, as the perpetrators were more of ten than not for mer and active military personnel, crooked cops, guerrillas from both the Communist and Moro in surgencies; in short, professionals with and trained in the use of guns. Wealthy families responded by sending their children to study abroad and beefing up their own private security details. The lure of illicit lucre even led to bizarre cases of preemptive kidnappings that targeted middle-in come professionals. A potential victim would be for ewarned by a kidnap gang to pay a stated amount of cash, on threat of carrying out the kidnapping. To combat the crime wave, Ramos appointed Vice President Estrada to be his anti-crime czar. Unfor tunately, Estrada’s silver-screen macho prowess as a crime fighter did little to discourage criminals. And his seeming preference for frontier-style justice led to charges by human-rights or ganizations that the government anti-crime units were too quick on the draw, with suspects of ten killed before any judicial proceedings could begin. The most brazen outfit to engage in kidnappings was the Mindanao-based Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), supposedly a militant Islamic renegade branch of the MNLF and founded in 1991 by Abdurajak Janjalani, who had trained and fought as a mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Russians. The ASG’s for mal name is Al Harakatul al Islamiya, or the United Islamic Movement. Abu Sayyaf (meaning, in Arabic, “Father of the Sword”) was said to be one of many “lost command” groups—a term that refers to a smaller breakaway faction that supposedly had cut off ties with its for mer parent group but in reality still worked clandestinely with the larger outfit. This tactic enabled, for in stance, both the MNLF and the MILF to disavow the ASG while benefiting from the fact that the latter was tying down military units hot on their pursuit. A thorn in the military’s side since the early 1990 s, with bombings and at tacks on poor Christian villages, the ASG purported to be fighting for an in dependent Islamic homeland in the southern Philippines and was believed to obtain some funding from Al Qaeda, through one of Osama bin Laden’s brothers-in-law, Mustapha Jammal Khalifa, who had married a Muslim Filipina and set up a charity in Mindanao. Upon the death of Janjalani in 1998, and under the leadership of his twenty-three-year-old brother Khaddafy Janjalani—who would himself be killed in a 2006 gunbattle with the police—the ASG reverted to kidnappings and assassinations that seemed motivated by financial gain rather than any ideological or religious motives—the main reason why its support among local Muslim populations was low. In one year alone, the ASG was reported to have received more than $10 million in ransom monies. The ASG used some of its loot to buy off both local politicians, so they would turn a blind eye to their presence, and army commanders to not pursue the gang so earnestly. In its modus operandi, the ASG was nothing if not bold. Among the many criminal acts it carried out was the abducting of 21 to urists and workers from a Sipadan, Malaysia, resort in 2000, and twenty vacationers from a Palawan resort in late 2001"

In 2002, of the twenty vacationers, three hostages remained in the hands of the ASG (the others having been ransomed or killed earlier, with one victim, Guillermo Sobero from California, beheaded): a missionary couple, Martin and Gracia Burnham, and Ediborah Yap, a Filipina nurse. A rescue operation mounted by U. S.-trained Philippine Rangers that same year resulted in the deaths of Martin and Ediborah and the rescue of Gracia. The Insurgencies Continue In 1996, the Ramos administration concluded an agreement with Nur Misuari and the Moro National Liberation Front. The five provinces that had voted for autonomy—Basilan, Tawi-Tawi, Sulu, Lanao del Sur, and Maguindanao—would make up the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), to be governed by a Misuari-led administration. A precedent, somewhat, had been set when President Aquino in 1987 had by executive fiat authorized the creation of the landlocked Cordillera Admini strative Region (CAR), in northern Luzon— home to the Igorot in digenous peoples—consisting of six provinces and the city of Baguio. The designation was to be a step to wards an autonomous region but in a plebiscite in 1998, the regional in habitants rejected the idea, preferring in stead the current setup, which provided for in stance for more local consultation with to wns and villages, but not as much authority as would have been legislated under an autonomous framework. The agreement may have meant the end of hostilities between Manila and the MNLF, by then a pale version of its 1970 s self, but not the cessation of armed conflict in Mindanao. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the breakaway faction led by Hashim Salamat (noted in an earlier chapter), was still at violent odds with the central government and the or etically with the MNLF, though the two groups steered clear of each other. Neither side wanted to fight brother Muslims. And if the MILF could gain concessions from the Ramos government, then the MNLF conceivably would benefit as well. Islamic fundamentalism, hinted at by the MILF’s more or thodox views on Islam, first reared its ugly head in the country in 1995, when a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul VI, due to visit Manila once more (the first visit had been in 1981) was discovered in advertently. The plotters were a Middle Eastern group led by a Pakistani militant Abdul Hakim Murad and Kuwait-born Ramzi Youssef. The apartment the men had rented was in Ermita, a to urist district of Manila, only 200 yards away from the Vatican embassy. The place caught fire and in the subsequent search of the place the police discovered papers and computer disks that revealed not just the plot to kill the pope but to plant bombs on U. S. airlines flying out of Manila and other Asian cities and have them detonate in mid-flight. Youssef, it turned out, had been one of the planners of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, when a van packed with explosives detonated in one of the to wers’ underground parking lots. In 1995, he was arrested in Islamabad in Pakistan, tried and convicted in Manhattan’s federal courts, and sentenced to 240 years in prison. The plot, code-named Project Bojinka (which means “loud explosion” in Arabic) in cluded hijacking airliners and crashing them into key structures in the U. S. Among those identified were the World Trade Center, the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the Sears Tower in Chicago. A trial run had in fact been conducted when Youssef boarded a 1994 Tokyo-bound Philippine Airlines flight out of Manila, hid a small bomb underneath a passenger seat, then deplaned at a stopover in Cebu. En route to Tokyo, the bomb exploded, killing a Japanese to urist, and for cing the plane to land in Okinawa. Murad, subsequent in vestigations determined, had taken flying lessons in aviation schools in the United States, earning a commercial pilot certificate in 1992. He was convicted for his part in Operation Bojinka. Philippine authorities passed this in for mation on to the U. S. Embassy in Manila and to the U. S. Joint Task force on Terrorism. Instead of envisioning a similar scenario playing out at domestic U. S. airports and tightening security that might conceivably have foiled the September 11, 2001 tragedy, U. S. authorities in stead demanded extra security precautions at Asian cities where U. S.-bound flights or iginated. On that grim morning, four passenger jets on U. S. domestic flights were hijacked by terrorists from the Islamic fundamentalist group, Al Qaeda: kamikaze-style, two were crashed into the World Trade Center to wers, collapsing them and taking close to 3,000 lives; one jet was flown into the Pentagon, seriously damaging it; and the fourth airliner crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers put up a fight. As for the CPP and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, though the guerrilla force had dwindled to approximately 6,000 fighters by the time Aquino’s term had ended, it experienced a resurgence in the mid 1990 s, the ranks estimated to have grown to 12,000 fighters by the beginning of the second millennium.

Undoubtedly, the U. S. emphasis on combating Islamic fundamentalism, combined with its traditional role as patron, in fluenced the overall strategy. Dancing the Cha-Cha Energized by his supporters and by a business community that viewed approvingly the political stability and sustained economic recovery, with the in evitable comparison with Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew, to wards the end of his six-year term, Ramos sought to change the one-term limit as mandated by the Constitution. A movement was quickly created, the People’s Initiative for Reform, Modern ization, and Action, or PIRMA, its acronym a clever play on the Tagalog word meaning “to sign.” The aim was to get enough signatures for a referendum on a constitutional convention. Ramos’s move for charter change through such a convention was quickly dubbed “Cha-Cha.” Powerful elements reacted quickly. Top Catholic bishops came out with a pastoral letter voicing their opposition. And ex-president Cory Aquino spoke impassionedly to a crowd of 200,000 at a rally meant to signal Ramos that the public wouldn’t stand for any extension of his or anyone’s term. With the memory of Marcos’s disastrous at tempts to perpetuate himself in power still fresh in the collective memory, the move by Ramos supporters for constitutional change fizzled out. Chastened, President Ramos pledged not to endeavor amending the constitution and to ensure a peaceful transfer of power in 1998, when the next round of national elections were to be held. Ramos and the governing party Lakas ng Tao, or People Power, backed House Speaker José de Venecia for the presidency and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the daughter of the for mer president Diosdado Macapagal, for the vice presidency. The opposition candidates were Ramos’s vice president Joseph Estrada; Senator Raul Roco; Secretary of Defense Renato de Villa; Juan Ponce Enrile; Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago; and Imelda Marcos. (In 1993, given permission by the Ramos government, the dictator’s widow had flown back from Honolulu with the body of her late husband, who had finally succumbed to the ravages of his long-term illness in September of 1989. To prevent a loyalist mob scene in Manila, the government or dered the plane to fly directly to Laoag City, in the heavily pro-Marcos Ilocos region in northern Luzon.) Once again, elections were held for all 17,200 elective positions in May of 1998. This time, the number of candidates exceeded 100,000—an average of almost six people competing for every position. For the highest of fice in the land, eighty-three in dividuals in itially filed for certification from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), in cluding a certain Mario Legazpi, who declared that he had descended from heaven to assume the presidency. The Commission weeded out all those unqualified, reducing the presidential field to seven candidates, in cluding Vice President Estrada and Imelda Marcos. Presumably, Legazpi ascended to his ethereal home, sorely disappointed at the less than worshipful reception he had gotten on Earth. But Ferdinand’s widow was for ced to drop out due to a conviction on charges of graft, which she was appealing, and which was subsequently overturned in 1998, after the elections. * Her loyalist bloc swung their votes in favor of Estrada, and Marcos-era cronies such as Eduardo Cojuangco and the to bacco tycoon Lucio Tan, both of whom had deep pockets, endorsed him. Estrada managed to garner limited support from the left, as he had voted against the ratification of the bases’ treaty in 1991—and had even produced and starred in an anti-bases film. He won with forty percent of the vote, with his nearest rival de Venecia garnering only 15 percent—the largest margin of victory in free Philippine elections. Estrada had been propelled to of fice by the urban poor and the disenfranchised, whose imagination he had captured by picturing himself as their savior. T HE B IGGEST R OLE OF H IS C AREER He was—and is—known to the public as Erap (from the Tagalog word pare, or buddy, spelled backwards). “Erap para sa Mahirap” (“Erap for the Poor”) was the catchy slogan President Joseph Estrada (1998-2000) used during his successful campaign, building on the cinematic portrait of himself as a death- defying proletarian action-star who always won in his crusade against evildoers, the main reason President Ramos had appointed him his crime czar. His campaign brilliantly capitalized on his well-known tendency to fracture English and commit linguistic malapropisms to stress his common-man qualities, releasing a collection of his unintentionally humorous use of English, Eraptions: How to Speak English Without Really Trial. (Sample: annoyed on one occasion by the fact that his listener couldn’t understand his English, Estrada was said to have remarked: “From now on, I will speak in the binocular!”) It made it easier for the common tao to identify with him; he was the sort of fellow folks would love to have a beer with.

None had more star power than a close friend of his, Fernando Poe, Jr., the king of action cinema and an even bigger star than Estrada. As expected, he endorsed Estrada. He himself would run unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2004. In fact, Estrada may have had pedestrian tastes but was decidedly un- proletarian, being from a solidly bourgeois family from San Juan, a relatively affluent municipality that was part of Metro Manila and where the shots that ignited the brutal 1899 Philippine-American War had been fired. He had at tended private schools, in cluding the exclusive all-male Ateneo de Manila High School, from which he was expelled for fighting. Later, he dropped out from the college where he had enrolled for an engineering degree, to pursue a career in film and quickly became a star, one who combined the derring-do of James Bond with a social conscience. Once he retired from the movies, he served as mayor of his hometown for seventeen years, before winning a Senate seat in 1987, and the vice-presidency in 1992. New Political Groupings By 1998, the political landscape had changed significantly. Along with Estrada, for the first time, following the mandate of the 1987 Constitution, 13 party-list representatives were elected, out of a potential 52. As briefly discussed in the previous chapter, the idea behind this new elective category, the party-list—a direct outcome of the 1986 People Power uprising—was to allow nongovernmental or ganizations to for mally represent the sectors that they worked with, such as the urban poor, women, and workers, traditionally with little in put in governance. In addition, there had arisen evangelical movements with popular followings among the working class and urban poor: El Shaddai and Jesus Is Lord. Both groups were capable of or ganizing huge rallies and, through endorsements, mobilizing their respective followers to back a particular candidate. These popular movements were well within the grassroots tradition of folk Christianity dating back to the Spanish colonial era—reminiscent of, for in stance, the populist Christianity espoused in mid nineteenth century by Apolinario de la Cruz (discussed in Chapter Three) and his Cofradía, who felt the Church hierarchy was too devoted to the Spanish and pro-Spanish native elite, the reby ignoring the particular circumstances of folk Catholicism as practiced by the majority of Filipinos in less circumscribed and in stitutionalized procedures. The gap between the social elites and the masses were in some ways reflected in the gap between the church hierarchs and affluent congregations on one hand and grassroots clerics and their poorer flocks, on the other hand. Nevertheless, as to be expected, the Catholic Church retained its considerable political clout, as did the Iglesia ni Kristo (INK, or Church of Christ) whose voters among its more than 2 million members vote as a bloc according to guidelines laid down by the church leadership. Hence, the INK, dominated by the Manalo family since its founding in 1914 by family patriarch Felix Manalo, was always courted by the political establishment. In contrast is the older nationalist Independiente Filipina Iglesia (IFI), the Independent Philippine Church, better known as the Aglipayan church, discussed in chapter four. With a majority of its congregation based in the Ilocos region, the IFI retains its nationalist, anti-imperialist leanings, and is in communion with the Episcopalian church as well as with the Old Catholics. Aglipayans are of ten viewed as troublesome anti-government activists. Its Chief Bishop, Alberto Ramento, a vocal critic of the Arroyo government, was killed in 2007 by, it was suspected, a pro-government death squad. Other clear in dications of deep-seated voter dissatisfaction with the trapos, or traditional politicians, were made evident when a number of celebrities from the entertainment, sports, and media worlds, undoubtedly encouraged by Estrada’s success, ran for political of fice, with many winning. Thus, for example, Robert Jaworski, a hugely popular professional basketball star; Ramon Revilla, a silver- screen action hero in the same mold as Estrada though not as popular; and Vic “Tito” Sotto, a well-known television personality, gained seats in the Senate. (A beloved comedian Dolphy was encouraged to run but refused. Asked why, he replied with a straight face, “I might win.”) Grown disenchanted, the voters sought fresh faces. At the same time, the faces had to be familiar ones, of figures who had risen to prominence outside the conventional political processes that had churned out society’s leaders. There were more than enough stars in the movies, sports, and media who met this criterion and only too willing to meet this need. The MILF The Ramos government and the 12,000-strong MNLF having reached an agreement in 1996 to set up ARMM, the AFP turned its at tention to the MILF. The Ramos administration had agreed to a truce with the MILF in 1997, and had set up peace talks. But encounters still took place between the rebels and the army.

      "ground_truth_context": ". The MILF The Ramos government and the 12,000-strong MNLF having reached an agreement in 1996 to set up ARMM, the AFP turned its at tention to the MILF. The Ramos administration had agreed to a truce with the MILF in 1997, and had set up peace talks. But encounters still took place between the rebels and the army. In early 2000, with President Estrada’s blessing, the army rejected the truce and launched what it termed an “all-out war” on thirteen MILF camps in Mindanao, renewing armed conflict on the island. At the same time, it took over the island of Jolo in its pursuit of the ASG, leading to more encounters. In an event that made newspaper headlines, Estrada flew to the stronghold of the MILF in central Mindanao, Camp Abu Bakar, once it had been overran by the army, and celebrated with the troops by eating roast pig—a deliberate, provocative act that was seen as an in sult to all Muslims. The MILF head Hashim Salamat fled to Malaysia and declared a jihad against the Philippine government. Warrants for his arrest were issued, and a reward for his capture of fered. A ceasefire was agreed to under the new government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and talks were once again resumed in 2001. The warrants were suspended, and Salamat returned to Mindanao. Not surprisingly, the talks stalled the same year. A key demand of the government was for the MILF to renounce terrorism, which Salamat did in mid 2003. Shortly after, the founder of the MILF died in Lanao del Sur Province, with its military commander Al Haj Murad emerging as the new chair. In a move that once again drew the U. S. military into this complicated picture, in 1998, the Estrada government and the United States had drawn up the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which the Senate ratified in 1999. For the first time since the termination of the bases treaty in 1992, U. S. troops were allowed into the country along with vessels and aircraft. Like the old bases treaty, the VFA reserved the right of jurisdiction over U. S military personnel to U. S. military authorities for purported crimes, unless such crimes were deemed to be of special significance to the Philippines. What that meant in practice was that it would still be difficult to prosecute a U. S. serviceman under Philippine law. The VFA provided an opening which would widen considerably in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, when Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had already succeeded Estrada as president. E RAP’S D OWNFALL Erap proved to be less than assiduous in his devotion to the mahirap. For the electorate, it was déjà vu, since corruption during his brief tenure stemmed largely, à la Marcos, from vulnerability to his family and cronies. Relying on friendships built over the years, over nights of carousing and drinking, his friends easily got presidential approval for loans, lucrative deals and government contracts. These friends got to be known as Estrada’s Midnight Cabinet—in truth a reprise of the barkada system, a barkada being a tightly knit circle of close friends who knew each other from their salad days and whose loyalty to one another was almost as strong as family ties. One never said No to either the barkada or the family. Estrada was thus as easily in fluenced by his close-knit barkada as by his kin. Was he in fact the second coming of Marcos? While Estrada used public of fice for enrichment for himself, his family, and his barkada, the cronyism was not as devastating to the economy as it had been under Marcos, when the in dividuals in volved were experienced players in business and in ternational finance, and the sums much larger. Too, Estrada’s time in of fice was short, two and a half years, compared to the two decades that the Marcoses had been in power. No doubt encouraged by her friendship with Estrada and by his style of personal governance—something she could relate to—Imelda Marcos announced to the world that she was determined to recover $12 billion in assets her late husband and she owned. She had dropped this bombshell in response to the on going struggle—began during Aquino’s term—over who actually owned and controlled San Miguel Corporation, the country’s largest business enterprise and responsible for 4 percent of GDP, and 6 percent of tax revenues. She was miffed by supposedly ungrateful cronies who she claimed were given large amounts of money by her late husband to acquire companies on his behalf. Imelda declared, “This was in the 1970 s. Now they want to hold on to wealth they did not own in the first place.” She defiantly told the press, “We own practically everything in the country.” This was in deed a dramatic turnaround from when her defense lawyer proclaimed during her 1990 New York trial that she was really a poor girl who relied on the kindness of strangers. (The 1990 trial was the first time she had publicly and reluctantly allowed that her upbringing was less than privileged.) Knowing that President Estrada was sympathetic to the Marcoses, Imelda also sought to have Ferdinand in terred at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani, or National Heroes Cemetery, the Philippine equivalent of the Arlington National Cemetery. Estrada in dicated that he was of a mind to approve her request but the firestorm of protest that erupted for ced him to back down. Imelda and the Marcos loyalists had to content the mselves with the display of the late dictator’s embalmed corpse in a mausoleum located in Batac, Ilocos Norte, open to the public. But what proved to be fatally damaging to his presidency were revelations made in mid-October 2000 by the governor of Ilocos Sur, Luis “Chavit” Singson, a friend and fellow gambler. Governor Singson had collected more than $20 million in bribes from illegal gambling syndicates that operated a numbers game, popular throughout the country, known as jueteng, bribes that he then claimed to have passed on to the president. Singson said he had made these revelations to protect himself, alleging that the president (or the president’s men) had made not just threats on his life but that in the wee hours of October 9, 2000, policemen had surrounded him and his bodyguards in his bulletproof Chevrolet Suburban. Nothing came of the confrontation and Singson lived to tell tales out of school. Other sordid revelations followed: siphoning money from national lottery funds in tended for charities, and from to bacco taxes.

Newspaper accounts provided details of how the money was spent to support the lifestyles of Estrada’s different mistresses and their of fspring, in cluding the construction of expensive residences and the purchase of luxury vehicles. Estrada himself seemed unapologetic for his penchant for high living. During his campaign for the presidency he made no secret of his amorous life; it may even have boosted his popularity. Media reports revealed that the president had at least three known mistresses, with each getting a mansion, and only in wealthy neighborhoods such as Forbes Park, the most exclusive enclave in the country. One home cost the equivalent of $4 million. Another palatial residence, a 7,400-square-meter property, was nicknamed “Boracay,” after an island in the south famed for its sugary white beaches. Some of the island’s fine sand had been flown in to create a mini-beach by the residence’s gargantuan swimming pool that came with a wave-making device. The obvious question of course was, where did all the money come from? Investigative reports, principally from the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, portrayed a sordid network of kickbacks, commissions from jueteng, and the use of government funds (principally from Social Security and the Government Service Insurance System) to purchase shares in or acquire private corporations. Impeachment proceedings against President Estrada began on November 13, 2000, when the House of Representatives approved and passed a motion on to the Senate for Estrada’s removal. Less than a month later, on December 7, the Senate opened impeachment hearings against the president, citing a long list of bribery and corruption charges. A turning point was reached on December 20, when an in vestigation began into a particular bank account with the Philippines third-largest bank, Equitable PCI. Apparently, a check for $2.8 million had been issued in the name of José Velarde. Prosecutors alleged that Velarde was a nom de plume of Estrada’s. A bank clerk came for ward to testify that she saw the president sign the check. The bank—itself the merger of two banks or chestrated by Estrada cronies—was believed to be the repository where at least $2.2 billion was alleged by government prosecutors to have been deposited between August 1999 (when the Velarde account was opened) and January 2000. But Estrada partisans had the majority in the Senate. By early January 2001, the televised impeachment trial was stopped in its tracks when the senators voted 11 to 10 not to open bank records that would have allegedly provided the smoking gun and thus in criminate the president. One pro-Estrada senator, Teresa Aquino Oreta (the sister of the slain Ninoy Aquino), was caught on camera doing an impromptu jig, an image that helped to in flame anti-Estrada protests in Metro Manila. The citizenry took to the streets in a reprise of People Power, quickly nicknamed “EDSA Dos,” or EDSA Two, demanding Estrada’s resignation. (EDSA stands for Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, Metro Manila’s major thoroughfare, and the site for the People Power uprising of 1986.) The number of protesters swelled to a million, and on January 19, a chorus of military and church leaders declared their support for Vice President Arroyo to take over as president. The embattled Estrada called out his own followers (a large number of whom were Marcos loyalists) in a counterrally, “EDSA Tres” (EDSA Three), but to no effect. On January 20, 2001, the Armed Forces of the Philippines for mally with drew its backing for Erap. The Supreme Court ruled that the presidency was now vacant, and Macapagal Arroyo was sworn in as president that same day. Charging that it was a coup since he had been constitutionally elected, Estrada and his family were for ced to abandon Malacañang. Arrested and for mally accused of plunder in April of 2001, Estrada was in detention for six years, for most of that period not at any common jail or military stockade but at his rather luxurious vacation home—complete with the ater, gym, and library—in a hilly suburb of Manila. After in numerable procedural delays, and testimony by a variety of witnesses, on September 12, 2007, the for mer president was found guilty of the crime of plunder by an anti-corruption court in Manila, and sentenced to forty years in prison. Estrada was or dered to pay the government $15.6 million and for feit a home he had built for a mistress— presumably funded by ill-gotten money. Prosecutors had charged him with being paid $85 million in kickbacks from to bacco taxes, commissions from both the illegal purchase of shares in private firms with government in surance funds and from jueteng—the various payoffs being deposited at the bank that figured prominently in the failed impeachment trial. A little more than a month after his conviction, on October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo pardoned the disgraced for mer president on condition that he not run again for national of fice.

De Venecia lost but Macapagal Arroyo won. Estrada appointed her secretary of social welfare and development. Since she hadn’t been elected to the presidency, the constitutional one-term limit did not apply to her. Nevertheless, in 2002, Macapagal Arroyo stated that she wouldn’t seek a second term as president, causing a dramatic surge in her approval ratings. Pressured by her advisers and family and friends, it wasn’t too long, however, before she reneged on her word and declared that she would in deed seek a second term come the 2004 elections. Her main rival was Fernando Poe Jr. a close friend of Estrada whom he had endorsed in the last elections, and, as noted, was an even bigger star. It didn’t hurt that his wife was Susan Roces, a for mer movie star herself, the reigning celluloid queen in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s. While the iconic film hero’s immense popularity meant an early lead in the polls, Poe lacked the campaign machinery, the political experience, and media know-how that Macapagal Arroyo had. Amidst protestations of poll irregularities, the in cumbent was declared winner of the 2004 elections. Hello Garci, Goodbye, Gloria—Almost Allegations that GMA had had the electoral tally rigged—or in popular slang, subjected to dagdag, bawas, or additions and subtractions surreptitiously done to in fluence the outcome—gained traction when wiretapped conversations surfaced in mid 2005, between a woman widely presumed to be the president and a man widely believed to be COMELEC Commissioner Virgilio Garcilano. Between May 26, 2004 and June 10, 2004, there were fifteen phone calls altogether. The subject was the electoral count. The exchanges had taken place after the voting was over but before a winner had been declared, and reflected two concerns: one, that the margin of victory be more than 1 million; and two, that the electoral tallies from the of ficial certificates of canvass (a summary of votes from each region) and from the statements of votes from each of a region’s precints, when added up, would not match as they were supposed to. The conversations were promptly dubbed the “Hello Garci” tapes” by the media, and the ring tone that could be heard on the tapes became commercially popular. The caller expressed particular concern about the tallies from southern Mindanao, given that there were reports in the media of irregularities there. A Hadji Abdullah Dalidig, head of NAMFREL in the province of Lanao del Sur, declared, for in stance, that the 2004 elections were “the worst and dirtiest” of the five elections he had monitored in the province. “What was done to the votes at the presidential level, even grade one schoolchildren would know the votes of the other candidates were sabotaged.” In the nearby province of Maguindanao, the governor Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the entrenched political clan, the Ampatuans, and a close political ally of President Macapagal Arroyo, guaranteed that his bailiwick would go for her. He was so good at keeping his word that in two to wns there were zero votes for the movie superstar turned presidential candidate, Fernando Poe, Jr. Both the House and Senate demanded an in vestigation; there were calls for Arroyo’s resignation. A motion for impeachment was filed but got nowhere. The president refused to step down, though she did admit talking to a COMELEC of ficial during the canvassing period. She conceded that it was a “lapse in judgment.” However, she emphasized that the conversations occurred after the votes had been counted. Nor did she name the of ficial in volved. Once the scandal broke, Garcillano dropped from public view; there were sightings of him in various places, even abroad. More than five months later, he surfaced and admitted that he had conversed with President Arroyo during the canvassing period, and, as she had stated, after the votes had been tallied. He denied that the president had asked him to rig the count in her favor. The calls were unseemly, and the probability that Arroyo had in terfered with the 2004 elections led to the resignation in July 2005 of eight cabinet members and two bureau heads— dubbed “the Hyatt 10” for having announced their decision at the Manila Hyatt hotel. The group asked the president to resign, pointing out in a prepared statement that “resignation is a legitimate constitutional option for effecting leadership change.” That call was renewed in 2009, on the fourth anniversary of the group’s mass resignation, with its members now adding the charge that the president was seeking to stay in power beyond the constitutional limit, either by declaring a state of emergency or through charter change—the same possibility that President Ramos had tentatively explored—and that was once again being proposed. Other scandals mainly in volving corruption plagued Arroyo’s administration, with one in particular eroding its credibility further. In April 2007, the Philippine government and a Chinese firm, ZTE, agreed on a $329.5 million contract for a national broadband network. Soon after, allegations were made about kickbacks from ZTE in volving Benjamin Abalos, the new chair of COMELEC, and the president’s husband, Mike Arroyo. The allegations were credible enough for the Supreme Court in September 2007 to issue a temporary restraining or der, freezing the deal. Due to the political brouhaha and threatened in vestigations by Congress, President Arroyo cancelled the contract in October of the same year. Complicating the entire matter was the claim of a mid-level government of ficial, Rodolfo Lozada, who declared in different public fora that in deed the president’s husband and the COMELEC chair were behind the kickback scheme—charges both parties were quick to deny.

Among those demanding her ouster were for mer presidents Aquino and Estrada; in the latter’s case, it was clearly payback for his peremptory removal from of fice, even though Arroyo had pardoned him. People called for the president to step down at public rallies; there were hopes for another massive outpouring of citizens onto the streets—a reprise of the 1986 People Power phenomenon— to force her resignation. None materialized, however. One reason was that Arroyo’s vice president Noli de Castro, for merly a well-known broadcast anchor, was on no one’s list as a plausible alternative. For another, the flamboyant the ater of the streets had ultimately proved to be disappointing as a way of effecting fundamental change —the current president herself being proof of this axiom—and the population had become understandably wary of going this route once more. Q UO V ADIS, P HILIPPINES? The Global War on Terror Since 2001, the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s record on human rights has led critics to compare her government to that of Ferdinand Marcos. A major reason for the deterioration of the state of human rights that had been restored so dramatically during Cory Aquino’s tenure came from the alignment, in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, of Philippine government policies with those of U. S. President George W. Bush that came to be labeled the “Global War on Terror.” Eight days after the collapse of the World Trade Center to wers, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo became the first Asian leader to endorse the Bush administration’s global war on terrorism. By doing so, she in ternationalized her country’s two in surgencies, recasting these as terrorist threats to an ill-defined world or der. None of the in surgencies, past or present, that the AFP had faced since the country regained its in dependence in 1946, were ever viewed by Manila as more than in ternal, albeit serious, threats. However, as detailed in previous chapters, any serious domestic challenge to the Philippine government, such as the Huk in surgency in the 1950 s, was in variably seen by the U. S. as a threat to its own in terests, mainly to its bases in the country, for which Washington extended economic and military aid to Manila and guaranteed U. S. in terference in Philippine affairs. Through the war on terror, the country was thus once again able to tap into U. S. aid, reduced substantially since the closing of the bases in 1992, and facilitated the revival of U. S. proprietary aims on the archipelago. By February 2002, U. S. troops had been deployed in the islands for a series of joint exercises with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), dubbed Balikatan, or Shoulder-to-Shoulder—apparently in violation of the Philippine Constitution, which prohibits the presence of for eign troops in the country but which the government contended was allowed by the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998. At the outset of these joint exercises, the Bush government promised the Philippines $100 million in mostly military aid. For the peace talks between Manila and the MILF, U. S. Congress earmarked $30 million in 2003, while USAID promised $20 million for the following year. Arroyo’s enthusiastic support for Bush’s war, while embarrassing to nationalists, was unsurprising, and was in keeping with how Philippine leaders have traditionally used the country’s strategic location in Southeast Asia as a bargaining chip, extracting economic and military aid from the United States, which has always viewed the Philippines as crucial to maintaining both its regional and global hegemony—and of containing China, a prize sought during the heyday of empire, but now a superpower rival. Two other factors in creased the Philippines’ strategic value: a possible U. S. confrontation with North Korea as it sought to develop nuclear weapons, and the Philippines’ claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines, surrounded by rich fishing grounds, and thought to contain enormous reserves of oil and gas, this desolate stretch of tiny isles and coral reefs is being claimed as well by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Borneo, and Malaysia, either in part or in its entirety. Dispersed over 410,000 square kilometers, this patch of ocean may yet be a flashpoint between China and the U. S., with the Philippines as an American surrogate. For now, there is an uneasy détente, with the rival claimants for swearing the use of force to resolve disputes. U. S. troop presence in Mindanao was of course an iffy proposition, since memories of the campaign to pacify Mindanao during the 1899 Philippine- American War remained vivid, particularly of at rocities committed by American troops, such as the 1906 massacre of 600 largely defenseless Muslim men, women, and children in Bud Dajo. And unlike their Christian counterparts elsewhere in Mindanao and in the country, Moros identified more with the Middle East than with the United States. Nevertheless, its troops were welcomed to the island of Basilan, which had a fairly large Christian community, since the in itial target of this Balikatan exercise was the Abu Sayyaf, and Basilan was a stronghold of the gang. For the U. S., fighting the ASG bolstered its claim to be waging and winning the war against terrorism. It was widely believed that the local military units in pursuit of the Abu Sayyaf were on the gang’s payroll— enabling the ASG to conveniently elude the military just when they were about to close in.

If it took U. S. in volvement to rid the island of the ASG scourge, so be it. People were simply sick and tired of the gang. The tragedy of 9/11 allowed both governments a way of exploiting other ends —one regional and global, the other, local—seeming to play the role of avenging angels while reprising their roles as colonizer and colonized. Under the 2002 Mutual Logistics Supply Agreement (MLSA) between the two governments, the Pentagon could once again use the archipelago as a springboard for in tervention —euphemistically termed “stability operations.” The MLSA granted U. S. for ces access to Philippine military facilities throughout the country, converting the whole archipelago into a virtual base for the Pentagon, with out being tied down to fixed sites, as had been the case with Clark and Subic, that would otherwise leave the U. S. open once again to charges of permanent tenure. The 2002 agreement also allowed storage and stockpiling facilities for U. S. troops, as well as the construction of “temporary” buildings, all of which critics charged was a violation of the 1987 constitution, which requires that the building of “for eign military facilities” in addition to “for eign military troops and bases” be ratified by the Senate. The 1999 VFA and the 2002 MLSA allowed the United States military to broaden the scope of its activities, in cluding U. S. troops accompanying Filipino soldiers into combat or conflict areas. A U. S. embassy spokesman in Manila explained that the troops were “not in volved in any combat roles but will fire back if fired upon…. Our role is to advise and assist the Philippine military.” The danger, of course, was that these advisers could be drawn into combat, and wind up in a Vietnam-style quagmire. The Mindanao Conflict With the establishment in 1996 of ARMM, and Misuari as ARMM governor, the MNLF ceased for the most part to be a threat. But that peace between the AFP and MNLF was disrupted when in November 2001, Misuari engineered an armed uprising against the for mer. Elections to replace him as governor of ARMM were scheduled for later in the month. His followers at tacked the army headquarters in Jolo, the largest of the Sulu islands. The at tack failed, however, and Misuari with some of his aides fled to Malaysia. There, much to his unpleasant surprise and in contrast with the sanctuary he was accorded in the 1970 s during the Marcos regime, he was arrested, extradited to Manila, and imprisoned in a military stockade. In February 2005, supporters loyal to Misuari launched a series of assaults on army troops in Jolo. The trigger for the violence was thought to be the start of a huge military operation against the Abu Sayyaf. While the assaults were repulsed, they sent an unmistakable signal that the deposed ARMM governor and ex-head of the MNLF still had a significant following. Today, the AFP continues to face the NPA nation-wide, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao—and to a lesser extent the Abu Sayyaf Group. Reliable estimates put the strength of each guerrilla army at between 12,000 to 15,000 men under arms, while the ASG is believed to number no more than 400 armed men. The MILF, with more emphasis on its Islamic roots than the MNLF and based in central Mindanao, has broad popular support in rural areas where the historic lack of economic development has encouraged armed dissent. In 2000, as ment ioned earlier in this chapter, the army under then- president Joseph Estrada launched a crackdown on the MILF, leading to a renewal of armed conflict. The two sides signed a peace deal in 2001, but violent in terludes seem to alternate with periods of relative peace. In February 2003, the Philippine military accused the MILF of harboring members of the small but militant Pentagon kidnap gang, yet another “lost command” group accused of abducting for eigners for ransom, and launched a new of fensive. The MILF denied providing sanctuary to Pentagon members. It also denied being behind a bomb blast at Davao City Airport in March 2003, that killed 21 people. Both the U. S. and the Philippine governments also suspected the MILF of having ties with fundamentalist groups such as Jemah Islamiyah in Indonesia, held responsible for deadly bombings on Bali in 2002 and 2005, links the MILF denied having. Still, neither the U. S. nor the Philippine government had branded the group as terrorist—allowing the Philippine government to hold talks with the group in Malaysia, with tacit U. S. support. (In contrast, in 2002, the Bush administration designated the NPA a terrorist group even though everyone acknowledged that it had no ties to any for eign terrorist or ganization.) The truth was somewhere between: given the history shared by MILF and other Southeast Asian mujahideen in fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, and porous southern sea borders between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, ad hoc ties but no for mal arrangements probably existed between the different groups.

The effect would be to add 712 to wns to the existing Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Subject to a plebiscite, the designated territory, the Bangsamoro Homeland, would not be under the jurisdiction of the central government but would in stead be ruled by the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity. The proposed expansion led to protests among predominantly Christian villages that would have become part of ARMM, resulting in a legal challenge to the proposed agreement. Prior to the for mal signing between the MILF and Philippine government of ficials in Malaysia, the Philippine Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining or der that froze the agreement and led to the cancellation of the signing ceremony. As feared, the setback led to a violent backlash, with MILF and army units clashing in central Mindanao in August 2008, with at least thirty fatalities. Accused of political in sensitivity, the central government stepped back from the proposed deal and said that it would seek a way to accommodate MILF demands through another mechanism. What that mechanism might be was never specified. Nevertheless, another ceasefire was agreed to in late July of 2009, leading to a revival of peace talks. The NPA Rebounds The focus on the MILF obscured the on going, by 2009, forty-year-old conflict with the NPA, even as the guerrilla army stepped up its at tacks on army and police units. From its peak of at least 25,000 armed regulars in the waning years of the Marcos regime, the NPA, as stated previously, had declined by 1994 to 6,000, and at the beginning of the second millennium, had climbed back to more than 12,000 strong. It remained a palpable presence in rural areas, where poverty seemed to be, as it had always been, a permanent feature of the landscape. Too, it and its political base, the Communist Party of the Philippines, were no longer plagued by the in ternecine and bloody struggles of the late 1980 s. Like those with the Muslim in surgents, talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF)—representing the CPP (whose founder, José Maria Sison, has lived in exile at The Hague in the Netherlands since 1987) and the NPA—have occurred in fits and starts since the late 1980 s. Complicating matters was the fact that in August 2002, the U. S. labeled the NPA a terrorist or ganization, with the European Union following suit in 2004, even though Washington never linked the NPA to any for eign group. The NDF broke off the talks and demanded that the label be with drawn. Sison was put on the terrorist list as well, arrested by Dutch police in August 2007, and charged with or dering three assassinations in the Philippines. He was then or dered released by the Dutch courts while in vestigations into the allegations were being pursued. The Arroyo government, for its part, has not labeled the NPA a terrorist group, and even though for mal talks had stalled, engaged the NDF in in for mal sessions. Up until the resumption of for mal talks in the Norwegian capital of Oslo in 2009, the two sides in principle had agreed to certain steps that would move to wards a for mal peace deal. These steps would in clude setting up a joint commission to examine human rights abuses on both sides, and working to gether for the removal of the NPA, and of Sison, from the U. S. and the EU’s list of terrorist or ganizations. In late September of 2009, Sison’s name was struck from the list of terrorists, paving the way for the resumption of peace talks. Keeping the AFP in Line Playing subaltern to the United States in the war on terrorism also enables the Philippine military to push its own agenda to the for efront. Under Marcos, the size of the AFP had in creased dramatically, from 50,000 to 274,000 (in cluding a paramilitary force of 65,000). With the ouster of the dictator and his shoe-loving wife Imelda in 1986, and with the corresponding decline in U. S. military aid once the bases treaty had been rejected by the Philippine Senate in 1992, the AFP’s size was whittled down to 127,000. In 2004 its budget for its army, air force, and navy was less than $1 billion, hardly adequate given the decrepit state of much of its equipment, from aging M-14 and M-16 rifles to outmoded fighter planes. Wages were raised but not nearly enough. Grunts and lower-level of ficers had a litany of complaints, ranging from meager meal allowances to in adequate clothing and faulty weaponry. It seems that it isn’t tactical in telligence or for eign advisers the AFP needs but sweeping reforms. One factor that saps morale above all is that of financial hijinks at the top. A 2001 study of military corruption conducted by the nonprofit Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, found that as much as 30 to 50 percent of military funds goes to kickbacks. Widespread malfeasance in high places was in fact one of the major charges leveled against the government by the group of 350 mutinous soldiers, led by junior-grade of ficers, in the earlier- ment ioned failed coup at tempt of July 27, 2003.

S. While the putsch was universally condemned, the of ficers’ allegations drew widespread sympathy. Even AFP of ficials admitted to corruption in their ranks. In perhaps the most publicized in stance of corruption in the military, for mer AFP comptroller General Carlos Garcia was found guilty in February of 2009 by a Manila court of perjury in misdeclaring his assets in 2000, which the prosecution contended amounted to more than P 300 million, or approximately $6 million, a princely sum for an of ficer in a service that notoriously underpays its men. In addition, two of his sons were in dicted in the U. S. for smuggling $100,00 in cash into the country in 2003. As one local journalist put it, waging war and getting money from the U. S. “is an in dustry.” In the post-Marcos era, a politicized and demoralized AFP represents a greater threat to the government than either the MILF or the NPA, as shown by the number of coup at tempts since 1986, the last two being the July 2003 coup at tempt and another one in February of 2006, which shook Arroyo, especially as she had assiduously cultivated her relationship with the military—and which led her to declare a weeklong state of emergency. There was a popular outcry against the decree, with critics denouncing it as a Marcos-era ploy, since the last coup at tempt fizzled out apparently even before it could be launched. The War on Terrorism Terrorizes The war on terrorism is as much one of words, centered on the label “terrorist.” It means, as a character in Alice in Wonderland would have it, anything its user chooses it to mean. Marcos always paired “communist” with “subversive,” to tar anyone who opposed his regime. Both the U. S. government and Arroyo, by their wholesale labeling blur the distinction between ideologically driven groups like the NPA and the MILF, with their military targets, and a criminal gang like the Abu Sayyaf, to whom Islam and its alleged association with Al Qaeda is simply a cover for mayhem. What have been the effects of war on terrorism in the Philippines? Rather than improve the lives of those directly affected, it has made them worse. The war itself, especially in Mindanao, with its roots in the Spanish colonial-era conflicts, can be regarded as terroristic. The number of in ternal refugees ebbs and flows, depending on the state of the on going war. Most military encampments lie in civilian areas, putting these residents in danger every time hostilities resume. And the economic costs to both the government and the farmers, workers, and small entrepreneurs have been staggering—from 1975 to 2002, P 5 billion to P 10 billion (roughly $100 to $200 million) were spent annually on the conflict, monies that could have gone to wards social services and in frastructure development in the country’s poorest provinces. A horrifying corollary of Philippine participation in the war on terrorism has been the rise of politically motivated killings in the country since 2001. According to Karapatan, an umbrella group for various Philippine human rights or ganizations, to wards the end of 2009, 1,118 men and women had been summarily executed—“salvaged”—under Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s government. There were 204 cases of desaparecidos, where no body was ever found, and 1,026 cases of to rture. Supposedly in compliance with Bush’s global war on terror, President Arroyo ratcheted up her government’s pressure on the Philippine left, reviving memories of the Marcos dictatorship and its dirty war against the opposition. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights First have criticized the Arroyo government for failing to prevent —and even abetting—such killings. A 2007 report to the UN General Assembly by Special Rapporteur Phillip Alston, based on a fact-finding visit in February of that same year, echoed such criticism. * Alston pointed to two underlying causes for the unchecked murders: the in discriminate labeling of left-wing groups as “front or ganizations” for “armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy,” and a government “counter-in surgency strategy” that encourages “the extrajudicial killings of activists and other ‘enemies’ in certain circumstances.” Even the 2006 government-appointed Melo Commission, created precisely to in vestigate the unexplained killings of activists and journalists, blamed rogue elements in the military for these salvagings, or extrajudicial murders. The Commission took pains to ment ion Major General Jovito Palparan, whom a number of human-rights or ganizations accused of or chestrating the extrajudicial killings of anti-government activists wherever he was stationed. Noted the Melo Commission: “There is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed for ces, in particular General Palparan, as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, to lerating, and even encouraging the killings.” Palparan denied being directly responsible for the killings, though he did state “I just in spired the [triggermen]. We’re not admitting responsibility here, what I’m saying is these are necessary in cidents.” Those assassinated have in cluded pastors, labor leaders, student activists, farmers, workers, and journalists—at least fifty-nine of the latter were killed between 2001 and 2009, because of reasons directly related to their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which ranks the Philippines as one of the most dangerous places for its profession. As a veteran Manila columnist Luis Teodoro wrote, “The killings are an in tegral part of the policy to dismantle whatever else remains of the democratic and populist legacies” brought about by the 1986 overthrow of the Marcoses"

Noted the Melo Commission: “There is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed for ces, in particular General Palparan, as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, to lerating, and even encouraging the killings.” Palparan denied being directly responsible for the killings, though he did state “I just in spired the [triggermen]. We’re not admitting responsibility here, what I’m saying is these are necessary in cidents.” Those assassinated have in cluded pastors, labor leaders, student activists, farmers, workers, and journalists—at least fifty-nine of the latter were killed between 2001 and 2009, because of reasons directly related to their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which ranks the Philippines as one of the most dangerous places for its profession. As a veteran Manila columnist Luis Teodoro wrote, “The killings are an in tegral part of the policy to dismantle whatever else remains of the democratic and populist legacies” brought about by the 1986 overthrow of the Marcoses. On November 23, 2009, the worst case of a political massacre in the recent history of the country took place on the dusty roads of Maguindanao Province, turf of the Ampatuan clan, close political allies of President Macapagal Arroyo —the very same clan whose patriarch, governor Andal Ampatuan, had guaranteed her 2004 electoral victory in his province. Close to sixty people were slain by gunmen who had stopped the convoy they were traveling in, and the two or three vehicles that happened to be passing by as well. All the occupants— men, women, and children—were for ced to get out of their vehicles and marched to a nearby hilltop, where they were shot. None survived. The bodies were buried in a mass grave, dug up earlier, a backhoe still on the scene, one that apparently belonged to the provincial government. The murdered in cluded thirty journalists—the most killed in one in cident in the country, and the worst such case in recent press history globally, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They were accompanying the convoy headed to the provincial capital, where the candidacy papers of a potential gubernatorial rival was to be filed, for the 2010 elections. A majority of the victims were women, most of them Muslims. The rival clan, the Mangudadatus, believed that if the party were made up mainly of women, they would not be harmed, as the Koran teaches that they and children should be respected, even in times of conflict. Certainly contributing to the continuing threat of more human rights abuses was the passage by the Philippine Congress in July of 2007, of the Human Security Act (HSA)—a virtual copy of the U. S. Homeland Security Act. By broadening the government’s arrest-and-detention powers, the law seriously undermined civil liberties. With its vague definition of what constitutes “terrorism,” HSA in effect criminalized political dissent, e. g., burning an effigy could be seen as a terrorist act. In August of that year, in one of the first in stances of the law’s application, three visiting women’s-rights activists and members of the U. S.-based Gabriela Network, an affiliate of Gabriela Philippines, the nation’s largest feminist militant group with party-list representation in Congress, were in itially prevented from leaving Manila. Having at tended the 10 th Women’s International Solidarity Affair in the Philippines, the three found the mselves on a government watch list due to suspected ties to the Taliban—a nonsensical charge that was later dropped, and the women allowed to depart. It was a chilling exercise in arbitrary detention. The Cancer of Endemic Corruption The fact that the worldwide financial meltdown of 2008 didn’t affect the Philippines too much was, as it was in 1997, not so much due to the strength of the economy but rather to the relative lack of in tegration into global financial markets. Philippine banks, having taken steps to strengthen the mselves during the 1997 Asian financial crisis and conservative in their lending policies, were not as reliant as U. S. and European banks had been on financial products that turned out to be to xic. Nevertheless, since the United States plays a major part in the economy of the country—in 2007, it was the source of 33 percent of direct for eign in vestment—the pinch was bound to be felt. While negative growth was avoided, there were layoffs by for eign corporations such as Intel Philippines, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company shut down its plant first established in 1950. Additionally, remittances from OFWs, which make up 10 percent of GDP and with out which the Philippine economy would be in mortal danger (in 2009, these to taled $17.3 billion), lessened as the recession in such countries as the U. S. and the UK led to the layoffs of for eign workers. And with a global weakening of consumption, exports were expected to decline. The Philippines spends one-third of its budget just servicing its $54 billion for eign debt (as of the beginning of 2009), monies that could otherwise stimulate the economy and reduce the high levels of poverty—still the best single recruiter of angry young militants—with 44 percent of the population subsisting on $2 a day. Hunger is a daily companion to at least 20 percent of the population. Workers see their purchasing power weaken. In 2009, out of 73 cities globally, Manila ranked 70 th in terms of what the or dinary worker’s wages could buy. Another factor that bleeds the economy, as noted, has been the policy of militarization to combat in surgency, which has not worked. If it seemed effective during the Huk in surgency of the 1950 s, that was due to civil programs such as land resettlement for peasant Huk fighters and the speedy resolution of judicial cases. But the illness that vitiates the body politic above all is that of corruption.

Manila’s most pressing need is to root out corruption in government, a cancer that in the long run not only encourages but wreaks havoc more than any in surgency, and makes junior military of ficers harbor thoughts of coup d’etat. From the underpaid policeman susceptible to bribes from a motorist who commits a traffic violation to a desk-bound government bureaucrat who discreetly wangles for a commission or kickback to expedite the processing of a contract, corruption is a deeply entrenched fact of government. Ranked by Transparency International in terms of corruptibility, in 2008 the Philippines was 141 st out of 180 nations. In contrast, the country’s Southeast Asian neighbors, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, were ranked 47 th, 80 th, and 126 th, respectively. Two government departments long notorious as places to earn quick and easy money are the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Customs Bureau. According to a World Bank study quoted in a 2003 Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism report into how certain of ficials at the BIR amassed considerable wealth, half of every tax peso that can be collected is lost to corruption. The government’s Department of Finance says that to tal average annual tax leakage is 240 billion in pesos, or roughly $5.1 billion. The PCIJ report went on to say, “BIR postings are so lucrative and BIR of ficials so used to tampering [with] of ficial records that they try to delay retirement by ‘correcting’—pushing for ward—their dates of birth…. From 1989 to the first quarter of 2001 alone, 24 BIR personnel have petitioned the Civil Service Commission to change their birth records.” Civil service requirements decree enforced retirement at the age of 65. The losses of revenue from the corruption at Customs are another example of how pervasive this culture of payoffs and kickbacks is, and demonstrate how the burden of taxation falls disproportionately on the average Filipino taxpayer. According to a study made of the trade between the Philippines and China, between 1994 and 2007, every year revealed substantial discrepancies between the value of what China exported to the Philippines and the value declared by the Bureau of Customs of those goods or imports. In 1994, the difference was $181.4 million, or 38.1 percent less than the Chinese valuation. In 2007, the difference was $3.470 billion, or almost 50 percent of what the Chinese declared. The differences when it comes to Philippine exports to China are even greater. Thus, for 2007, according to export and import manifest forms supplied by Customs and compiled by the government’s own National Statistics Office, Philippine exports were valued at $5.715 billion while the Chinese valued the very same goods at $23.12 billion—a whopping difference of $17.405 billion, thrice more than the of ficial Philippine figure. The study concludes that “the value of Philippine exports to China for 1994-2007 were understated by an annual average of 137 percent, while the value of imports of the Philippines were understated by an annual average of 46.6 percent.” Clearly, when businessmen underreport both exports and imports, they save hugely on taxes and tariffs. The undervaluation of for eign products in turn hurts the domestic in dustry that manufactures the same kind of goods. The footwear, textile, garment and the nascent petrochemical in dustries are in stances where the combination of low tariffs, and smuggling has had a huge negative impact. Nor is the trade with China the largest source of revenue losses. In an analysis of data made under the auspices of the Manila-based University of Asia and the Pacific and conducted by Dr. Victor Abola, an economist, the results in dicated that between 1999 and 2001, “the largest trade leakages came from trade with Japan, the United States, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, and China,” with discrepancies ranging from 24.4 percent to 35.9 percent. Should the revenue losses due to corruption be stemmed considerably, the effects on the economy would be obvious: the principal on the country’s for eign debt could be paid off in a few years, expenditures on social services could be in creased, and in centives for joining the guerrillas in the hills would be diminished. Food Production The reliance on agricultural exports, or cash crops, has meant that production for local consumption and self-sufficiency in food has suffered. Instead, due to trade liberalization, there is an over-reliance on food imports. If the country is to improve its capacity to feed an ever-in creasing population, the government must pay at tention as well to more efficient agricultural production. According to a 2008 study, once the Philippines became a member of the World Trade Organization in 1995, “the contribution of local agriculture to the GDP … declined from 20.3 percent in 1995 to 14.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Of the 14.2 million hectares alienable and disposable lands, 93 percent or 13 million hectares are classified as agricultural lands and yet agricultural mechanization remains at the tail-end of our neighboring countries. Less than one percent of farmers use tractors and power tillers.

The obvious irony in this is that the Philippines used to be an exporter of rice.

Moreover, Vietnam and Thailand (the world’s largest exporter of rice) learned rice cultivation methods from the Philippine-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), which has developed high-yield varieties of rice. It was with some urgency that the Arroyo administration announced plans, also in 2009, to at tain self-sufficiency in rice by 2010—though how that would be at tained was left unclear. Creating and aggravating the in sufficiencies of domestic food production particularly in the case of rice is the lack of systematic and comprehensive government programs to provide, for in stance, credit to small farmers, develop in frastructure such as irrigation, in crease government purchase of rice (and thus lessen the importation of rice), and in stitute a genuine land-reform program to address landlessness. Changing the Game to Suit the Players By the end of her term in mid 2010, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo will have been in power as president longer than any other Philippine president, with the notable exception of Ferdinand Marcos, who had defeated her father, President Diosdado Mapacagal, when the latter ran for reelection in 1964. Like Ramos, President Arroyo signaled her desire to continue on as president or chief executive, through a change from the presidential to the parliamentary system of government. The speaker of the House of Representatives, dominated by her supporters, pushed in 2009 for a resolution that the House convene itself—and itself alone—as a Constituent Assembly that would then consider amendments to the 1987 Constitution, ostensibly to override provisions that stand in the way of fast-track economic development, and to switch to the parliamentary system. There are arguments to be made for a switch to a system that its advocates say is more responsive to Philippine political realities. Under a parliamentary system, for in stance, it would have been easier to force Macapagal Arroyo to step down if she had been prime minister rather than president. But political analysts, and public sentiment seems to agree, in sist that the Constituent Assembly, or Con-Ass, as it is referred to disparagingly in the media, really aims to convert the current presidential system to a parliamentary one, so that President Arroyo can then serve as prime minister and sidestep the current constitutional ban on a second-term presidency that would require her to vacate the presidency after the May 2010 national elections. The Senate has warned the lower House of its unwavering opposition were the congressmen to push on ahead with out the Senate. And there will most certainly be opposition in the streets were the 1987 Freedom Constitution altered to suit the ambitions of one person. This was made abundantly clear when for mer President Corazon Aquino, at the age of 76, died from colon cancer on August 1, 2009. The outpouring of grief was overwhelming. People stood in line for three to four hours for a quick glimpse of the late president. It took the funeral procession, at tended by an honor guard from the different military branches, nine hours to reach the memorial park where she was buried alongside her late husband Ninoy Aquino, due to the throngs that lined the streets six deep, many bearing her portrait or likeness and signs that at tested to the love people bore for her. The national mourning and the praise heaped on her as she lay in her bier, reminded anyone who needed reminding that the country had not for gotten the pivotal role that their Tita Cory (Aunt Cory) had played in replacing the twenty- year regime of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with a freewheeling, raucous democracy, however flawed. The public comparison between the recently deceased for mer president who never wished to extend her stay in Malacañang even by one day, and the sitting president who has made it clear that she does, rendered crystal clear the dismay with which Macapagal Arroyo’s tenure, and stature, have been viewed. That dismay was reflected in the sudden ascent of Cory and Ninoy’s son, Noynoy, elected to the Senate in 2004, to being the presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, when Senator Mar Roxas (grandson of Manuel, first president of the Republic), with drew in his favor and agreed to run for vice president in stead. Noynoy is the sentimental favorite to win, and it will be very difficult for any other presidential candidate to match his popularity. Like Fidel Ramos, realizing that changing the current presidential system to a parliamentary one would be an uphill battle, in late November of 2009, President Macapagal Arroyo filed her candidacy papers, to run for election as congresswoman from her home province of Pampanga—the first president in Philippine history to seek lower of fice. She would be replacing her son, Congressman Mike Arroyo Jr. This move has triggered in tense speculation that she has done so in or der to head off any at tempt on the part of the next Congress to hold her to account for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors while president, and to spearhead a renewed drive to in stitute a parliamentary system, so she can then seek the post of prime minister. Whether the next president and a new Congress will listen to the persistent voices of the electorate for substantial changes in the mode of governance to resemble more faithfully a much more democratic society remains to be seen. Serious, reform-minded legislators would have to go against the grain of special- in terest clan politics—in essence, against their own families—no mean feat in a society long accustomed to the transference of power and privilege along blood lines.

Many of these elected mandarins are more in tune with Louis XIV’s dictum, “L’etat, c’est moi,” than with the democratic notion of a government by the people, for the people, and of the people. President Aquino’s heart, her corazon, was undoubtedly in the right place, but family pressure as much as anything else doomed her land reform program since it left the family’s vast Hacienda Luisita untouched. Nowhere is the hold of clan politics more evident than in Congress, the nation’s preeminent legislative body. Ever since the Malolos Congress of 1898, lawmakers have consistently been drawn from the ranks of the Philippine elite. A groundbreaking study conducted by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and published in 2004, The Rulemakers, describes the modern Filipino legislator as predominantly male, someone who “has previously held a local government post and is a member of a political family with a sibling, father, or grandfather who has been voted into public of fice in the past.” A perfect illustration of how political power, once at tained, breeds a sense of entitlement is the Cojuangco family, which has had nine members elected to Congress since 1907, with President Cory Cojuangco Aquino representing the zenith of clan power. Her and Ninoy Aquino’s son, Noynoy, may yet reclaim that position. (Through him of course are linked two powerful political families, with the Aquinos, as of 2004, having had eight members elected to Congress.) Cory’s main rival, Ferdinand Marcos, with his own father having been a local politician, established the Marcoses as a political dynasty, serving as a congressman, then senator, and going on to rule the state for twenty-one years, with Imelda beside him. In a series of musical-chair moves, his heirs are making sure the family remains a prominent player on the political scene. His son, Ferdinand Jr., has served as governor of Ilocos Norte—Marcos’s home province, where the late dictator is viewed almost as a deity—and will be running for the Senate in 2010. His sister Imee, having served in Congress, will now run for the governorship vacated by her sibling. And the ruling matriarch Imelda, resilient as ever even at the age of 80, having represented her home district of Leyte as a congresswoman, has filed her candidacy papers for the congressional seat Imee is leaving behind. There have been positive changes to the almost monopolistic nature of the power structure. The party-list feature, in troduced by the 1987 Constitution, has produced cracks in the façade; while party-list representatives are a minority bloc, still, they do bring viewpoints that represent the left as well as segments of society—workers, women, the youth—normally underrepresented in Congress. The party-list solons eschew the trappings of their more conventional colleagues, portraying the mselves as non-traditional politicians. Another pressure block is that of the overseas Filipino workers who have registered for the May 2010 elections, numbering approximately 600,000—almost twice the number that registered for the 2004 elections. With a perspective gained from living abroad, they are not as subject to the in tense politicking that goes on in the islands in the run-up to the elections and are the refore less likely to feel bound by parochial in terests. Candidates who can tap into their discontent would have quite an advantage at the polls. In the continuing dance between for mer colonizer and for mer colony, the United States remains the country’s most dominant for eign partner. While the U. S. no longer to uts the Philippines as a showcase of democracy, it of ten in vokes what it terms the “special relationship” between the two countries. This is echoed in how Manila reliably follows the lead of Washington when it comes to for eign policy. In both its regional and in ternational in volvement, whether through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperative (APEC), or the United Nations, the Philippines rarely deviates, if at all, from any given United States position. It was not surprising the refore that in 2002, President Arroyo stepped for ward as the first Asian president to endorse the U. S.-in itiated Global War on Terror, for which the U. S. designated the Philippines as a major non-NATO ally in 2003. In economic terms, this “special relationship” translates into the U. S. being the Philippines’ largest trading partner, with $17 billion worth of trade in 2008, and $6 billion in direct in vestments. The country is the U. S.’s 31 st largest export market and its 37 th largest supplier. Starkly put, the challenge is for the Philippine government to forge a more in dependent for eign policy while maintaining its trading ties with the United States. One way to do that is to develop wisely and efficiently the natural resources with which the country, like its Southeast Asian neighbors and so many other developing countries, is abundantly blessed. While afflicted, for in stance, by deforestation, destruction of its coral reefs, and depletion of rich fishing grounds, the country sits on enormous mineral reserves—gold, copper, nickel, silver, gypsum, among them—said to be one of the world’s largest and estimated to be worth at least $840 billion. In addition, off the coast of Palawan Island are believed to lie tremendous natural gas reserves. Given these treasures, there is every reason the country should manage to lift itself out of poverty that has crippled it for so long and that propels millions of its citizens to seek a better life outside its borders. To do that, there has to be a consistent, long-term, and transparent government-funded anti-corruption drive, accompanied by more efficient revenue collection to provide for much- needed government services and to regularly upgrade the country’s perennially creaky in frastructure. And the narrow, personalized politics of clan rule—with its roots in the datu system abetted by a procession of colonial rulers—must give way to the rule of the majority rather than the few"

      "ground_truth_context": ". One way to do that is to develop wisely and efficiently the natural resources with which the country, like its Southeast Asian neighbors and so many other developing countries, is abundantly blessed. While afflicted, for in stance, by deforestation, destruction of its coral reefs, and depletion of rich fishing grounds, the country sits on enormous mineral reserves—gold, copper, nickel, silver, gypsum, among them—said to be one of the world’s largest and estimated to be worth at least $840 billion. In addition, off the coast of Palawan Island are believed to lie tremendous natural gas reserves. Given these treasures, there is every reason the country should manage to lift itself out of poverty that has crippled it for so long and that propels millions of its citizens to seek a better life outside its borders. To do that, there has to be a consistent, long-term, and transparent government-funded anti-corruption drive, accompanied by more efficient revenue collection to provide for much- needed government services and to regularly upgrade the country’s perennially creaky in frastructure. And the narrow, personalized politics of clan rule—with its roots in the datu system abetted by a procession of colonial rulers—must give way to the rule of the majority rather than the few. Somewhat like its mineral wealth, the country’s democratic spirit may at times appear to be buried but it is vast and powerful. That democratic spirit has been tapped into before, most notably in 1896 and in 1986. To harness it on an on going basis and transform the nation fundamentally and for the better has always been the challenge faced by the Philippine Republic since its in ception."

      "ground_truth_context": "AFTERWORD A s expected, Benigno Simeon Aquino III won the presidential elections held in May 2010, beginning a six-year one-term presidency. What was surprising was the candidacy of disgraced felon for mer president Joseph “Erap” Estrada, who was for ced out in early 2001, and was succeeded by his then vice-president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Running again for the highest of fice in the land, despite a pledge not to do so—a condition for his presidential pardon in 2007— Estrada placed second, in a testament to his enduring popularity as a likeable rogue. He may very well have won, had not the field of candidates split the non- Aquino votes. The in defatigable Estrada then went on to campaign in 2013 for the mayoralty of Manila, winning over the in cumbent Alfredo Lim. What have been the Aquino administration’s hallmarks in its four years in power? T HE D RIVE A GAINST C ORRUPTION The biggest accusation against the Arroyo administration was that it proved to be massively corrupt in its nine years in power. Indeed, corruption has been the single most pressing issue facing governance in the country since it became an in dependent state in 1946. In his in augural address President Aquino—referred to as P-Noy, a play on the words “Pinoy” (an in for mal term for “Pilipino”) and “Noynoy,” the president’s nickname— made anti-corruption one of his administration’s priorities, telling his countrymen, “If no one is corrupt, no one will be poor” and that the people were his “boss.” The Aquino administration didn’t lose time, moving for the impeachment of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Renato Corona, who had been a midnight appointment of President Arroyo. (For his swearing in, Aquino chose another justice of the Supreme Court to administer the oath of of fice, rather than Corona.) On December 12, 2011, the House of Representatives impeached Corona. The proceedings then went to the Senate, where he was found guilty on May 29, 2012, of the failure to properly list his assets, liabilities, and net worth. Another high-profile case was that of for mer Army Comptroller Major General Carlos Garcia—referred to in a previous chapter—who was accused of plundering millions of dollars from army funds, to enrich himself and his family as well as some members of the top military brass. The general would have escaped with a slap on the wrist due to a plea bargain wherein he would have surrendered his assets (already subject to for feiture) had not the Aquino government pushed for his court martial by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He was adjudged guilty and sentenced to 11 years behind bars. One of the most publicized anti-corruption cases has been against President Aquino’s predecessor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, widely perceived as being implicated, along with her husband, First Gentleman Mike Arroyo, in the previously noted corruption scandals that rocked her administration. A warrant of arrest was issued to the for mer president in October of 2012 just as she checked into the government-run Veterans Memorial Medical Center, on corruption charges in relation to the alleged misuse of more than $8 million in state lottery funds. There she remains, though her lawyers have requested that she be allowed to return home and be placed under house arrest. With these highly publicized cases, an improved GDP—the fastest-growing economy in Asia in 2013—and the fact that in ternational credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s have given the country an in vestment grade, President Aquino declared in his 2013 State of the Nation Address that his government was on the verge of eliminating the last vestiges of corruption. In spite of undeniable progress, this is more hyperbole than fact. In reality, government malfeasance is still widespread, deeply rooted in agencies whose of ficials and employees are not usually in the public eye. Bureaucratic corruption is particularly entrenched in such departments as the Bureau of Customs. A February 2014 study released by the Washington-based advocacy group, Global Financial Integrity (GFI) showed that, from 1960 to 2011, $410.5 billion in illegal funds flowed in or out of the Philippines: $132.9 billion in outflows and $277.6 billion in in flows. A major source of such illicit transactions is what analysts term “technical smuggling,” where importers bring in goods through the ports, pay some taxes but misdeclare or substantially undervalue the shipments. Since 1990, according to the GFI study, such undervaluations have cost the government at least $23 billion in lost revenue. The authors of the study, that corroborate earlier ones done by the World Bank and the government’s own Department of Finance, point out that the illicit in fusion of cash and merchandise abets crime and corruption, and while this helps the underground economy, it does so, for in stance, at the expense of government social programs that seek to reduce poverty. What the study doesn’t directly refer to is outright smuggling, where no duties at all are paid. Goods are brought surreptitiously into the country, either through Sulu in the south, where the borders with Borneo are quite porous, or further north, off the waters of Ilocos Norte. Because smuggled goods of fer unfair competition to domestic in dustries, many labor-in tensive in dustries such as garments and textiles, footwear and furniture have closed shop. Smuggling has even expanded to in clude rice, threatening the livelihood of farmers. Despite the fact that the Bureau of Customs is a well-known epicenter of smuggling, the government has been in consistent in cracking down on corruption within the bureau, even when the luxurious lifestyles of many of its employees raise legitimate concerns. Another stark in dication of the depth of corruption has been the scandal over the misuse of at least 10 billion pesos (approximately $250 million) worth of pork barrel funds—the Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) in tended for local projects—diverted to the personal bank accounts of certain legislators. In headline-grabbing revelations made by whistleblowers in July of 2013, taxpayers learned about an on going scheme, begun in 2003 and led allegedly by a businesswoman, Janet Lim-Napoles, wherein through fictitious projects for paper nongovernmental or ganizations (NGOs), the government issued Special Allotment Release Orders (SARO) authorizing the release of public funds. The funds, in turn, were diverted to legislators, sometimes in restaurants where bags of cash would be given to the legislators’ representatives. The government’s own Commission on Audit released a report linking many of these “ghost” NGOs to Lim-Napoles and to various government agencies. The for mer was subsequently arrested"

Three prominent senators have been in criminated: Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, for mer Secretary of Defense in the Marcos regime; Senator Jinggoy Estrada, son of impeached president and Manila mayor Joseph Estrada; and Senator Ramon Revilla, Jr. son of a well- known movie star. Five for mer House representatives as well as thirty government of ficials have also been implicated. In November of 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the source of pork barrel, the PDAF, was unconstitutional—a victory for the ad hoc anti-pork for ces that were behind the August 2013 peaceful gathering in Rizal Park, the largest protest since President Aquino assumed of fice in 2010. E CONOMIC P ERFORMANCE At the end of 2013, for eign debt stood at $59.1 billion, a reduction in four percent, from $61.7 billion. In spite of the endemic nature of corruption, which resides mostly in government agencies, the Aquino administration has made some economic progress. In his 2013 year-end address, the president pointed out how the country has moved from 134 th place to 105 th, in the rankings made by Transparency International, the global coalition against corruption, linking this to healthy economic growth. Indeed, GDP at 7.8%, is one of the highest in Asia. Rotterdam Week in its assessment at the end of 2013 ranked the republic 14 th out of 15 most improved economies, predicting the country to be Asia’s fastest growing economy in 2014 and possibly Asia’s next long-term winner. It issued a caveat by pointing out that a majority of Filipinos “still have a relatively low in come though, at just $2800 per head.” Moreover, according to the nonpartisan Social Weather Survey (SWS), the unemployment rate is a high 27.5%, an in dication that while the economic tide may be rising, it isn’t raising all boats. Call Centers. Contributing to the rise in GDP has been the proliferation of call-centers, one of the fastest growing in dustries in the country, and a significant player in the global business processing outsourcing estimated at $150 billion. It seems to have replaced India as the top destination for outsourcing, though with the strengthening of the peso, India may yet regain its premier position. With its relatively low labor costs and the American-style English language skills the local workforce has, traceable to its for mer status as a United States colony, the country appeals to for eign corporations. The latest count of call centers has them at 1,000—dispersed around the country, with the majority situated in the metropolitan Manila region. Overseas Filipino Workers. While there have been encouraging signs of economic growth, overseas labor remains a linchpin of the economy, with the country, according to Congressman Walden Bello of Akbayan (Citizens’ Action Party), “one of the great labor exporters of the world. Some 11 percent of its to tal population and 22 percent of its working age population are now migrant workers in other countries.” Remittances in 2013 amounted to $22 billion, making the Philippines the fourth largest recipient of remittances, after China, India, and Mexico. Writing in 2013, Bello states, “For all in tents and purposes, the most dynamic sector of the economy is labor export. While government authorities are loath to acknowledge this, and there is only perfunctory acknowledgement of its role in the economy of the medium-term development plans, the reality is that it is labor export, with the billions of dollars it brings in to support the consumption of families of overseas workers, that keeps the economy afloat.” Industrialization. Unlike the East Asian tiger economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China, which have relied on state-driven in dustrialization as the main engine of their economies, the Philippines’ efforts in this regard have been and still are spotty. The overriding emphasis is on free-market, neo-liberal economic policies, where the state limits its role to setting and enforcing the rules, e. g. no unfair competition. It is an economic philosophy that argues against state in tervention, even to save key but ailing in dustries. The government’s own Philippine Development Plan, 2011-2016, issued by the National Economic and Development Authority, barely advocates for state in dustrial policy. Still, a more active state role has become acceptable in certain quarters in government, as evident in the drawing up of “road maps” for specific in dustries, spearheaded by the in dustry players the mselves, assisted by the government’s Board of Investments. Some road maps have been completed, notably that for iron and steel, cement and housing (which are all related) and for the copper in dustry. However, specific policy decisions recommended since early 2012 have still have to be implemented. An important one is the very strong recommendation by all the in dustries in volved in road mapping, to revive the government National Development Corporation (NDC) and the Industrial Development Council (IDC). The for mer played a key role in the in dustrialization of the country in the 1940 s– 1950 s, notably in the textile in dustry, setting up and operating textile mills. The latter was created by law during the first Aquino administration but has since at rophied. Its aim was to bring to gether all key economic managers and the private sector to draw up policies and plans for in dustrialization, to at tain policy and planning congruency and consistency.

T HE R EPRODUCTIVE H EALTH B ILL Proposed more than a decade ago, the reproductive health bill was finally signed into law by President Aquino in 2012. The bill requires the government to promote family planning, responsible parenthood, and sex education from grade five through high school. Under its provisions, both the national and local governments are to make available reproductive health services, in cluding prenatal care and the distribution of condoms, and to provide for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS cases. Given the established correlation between population and poverty, with the poor having the largest families—with a population of nearly 100 million, the Philippines is the 12 th most densely populated country globally—one principal aim is to reduce the population growth, 1.89% in 2013. In a nation that is 80 percent Roman Catholic, the bill has predictably drawn fire, principally from the conservative Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), which has consistently at tacked the bill, of ten referring to it as “Satanic” and equating its policies with legalizing abortion. Proponents of the bill point out that it does nothing of the kind since abortion is for bidden by the 1987 Constitution and is criminalized under the Philippine Penal Code. They also cite studies that show a reduction in the abortion rate when better family planning practices are encouraged and supported. T HE I NSURGENCIES The MILF and the MNLF. On the last weekend of January 2014, the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest Islamic in surgency group in the country, agreed to a cessation of hostilities in the decades-long war in Mindanao, with an estimated 120,000 casualties, thus concluding negotiations began in 1997 under the Ramos administration. Brokered by the Malaysian government, the agreement authorizes the creation of an autonomous region to be called Bangsa Moro, or Moro Nation. The region would get the lion’s share of revenues generated by its natural resources. At the same time, the 11,000 strong military arm of the MILF would be deactivated, with a significant number expected to join the government security for ces. The government expects to have a bill submitted to Congress by June 2014 that will lead to the for mal creation of the Bangsa Moro. A similar agreement had been for ged in 1996 with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)—the older group from which the MILF broke away— resulting in the creation of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Due to corruption and factional fighting, however, ARMM was dysfunctional and thus widely seen as a failure. Similar obstacles confront the MILF, in cluding having to deal with smaller but more violent extremist groups, such as the Abu Sayyaf Group. The creation of the new entity, to be done under the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), will in corporate ARMM, though Nur Misuari, the founder of the MNLF opposes this, as he opposes the agreement between the government and the MILF. The peace agreement casts into irrelevancy both Misuari and the MNLF, but no analyst expects them to remain passive on lookers. An unmistakable signal was sent to the government when on September 2013, armed conflict between government troops and an armed faction of the MNLF erupted in Zamboanga City, when heavily armed MNLF fighters marched through the city center, provoking a battle that resulted in more than 200 casualties, mostly among the rebels and severely damaging neighborhoods where the rebels had lodged. The MNLF seems to have also been in volved in an in cursion into neighboring Malaysia. In early February of 2013, about 200 armed followers of the Sultan of Sulu, Jamalul Kiram III, landed on Eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo, a province controlled by Malaysia but one still technically under the purview of the sultanate, which bills itself as the Royal Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo. Until a lease deal with the British in 1878, Sabah was under the direct rule of the sultan. Annexed subsequently by the British, Sabah was in corporated in 1963 into a newly minted Malaysia. What complicates the situation is that Malaysia pays approximately $1,700 in rent to the sultanate, which considers the sum as absurdly low, for the approximately 45,000 square mile territory that is rich in natural resources and is highly profitable. The sultanate, however, has no real power, the sultan no wealth. In comparison, the Sultan of Brunei, a distant relative having the same great-great grandfather, is immensely wealthy and was once considered the world’s richest man. Following the in itial wave of sultanate fighters, hunted down by the Malaysian armed for ces, was another group estimated at 400 armed men, most likely MNLF guerrillas, making good the MNLF’s threat of a protracted war to help their beleaguered comrades. (The sultan–who died in October 2013 at the age of 75—was close to the MNLF leadership.) It is no coincidence that the tribal group dominant in both Sulu and the MNLF is the Tausug. The New People’s Army. The New People’s Army is on its 45 th year and the spearhead of one of the world’s longest-running in surgencies. Its strength is thought to consist of between a low of 5,000 and a high of 12,000-armed fighters. Its guerrilla fronts are dispersed through Luzon, the Visayas, and parts of Mindanao. Despite peace talks that began in 1987 under the first Aquino administration, no deal approaching that concluded with the MILF is in sight.

These tiny, mostly uninhabited (and of ten uninhabitable) islands sprawl over 160,000 square miles of the South China Sea (which the Philippine government refers to as the West Philippine Sea, and the Vietnamese as East Sea). Situated off the coasts of Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, and China, they are believed to hold 5.4 billion barrels of oil and 55 trillion feet of natural gas. Some of the globe’s richest fishing grounds are to be found here as well. Additionally, half of the world’s merchant fleet and one-third of its crude oil pass through these waters. The most powerful claimant is the People’s Republic of China, which has also been the most aggressive in pursuing its territorial aims in the region. Asserting that its claim is backed by historical records, the PRC points to its principal exhibit: a nine-dash map, with the nine dashes marking the outer limits of its claim, proceeding in a clockwise arc, from off the coasts of Taiwan to Vietnam. In effect, the PRC claims sovereignty over 90 percent of the waters. Their territorial layout in trudes into the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of the other Southeast Asian countries. As defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention of Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS), each nation’s EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from its shores. The Spratlys, for in stance, are 135 miles off Luzon and about 400 miles from Hainan, China’s closest island. The Philippines has asserted its sovereignty, terming them the Kalayaan Island Group. However, it effectively controls only five islands, two sandbars, and two reefs. It has asked the UN to adjudicate—China and the Philippines are both signatories to UNCLOS—but China has refused to participate. Instead, it in sists on bilateral talks, where it can exert much more pressure, rather than multilateral ones that could be set up through the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), many of whose members also have claims over the same area. The map above shows the Chinese government’s claim to the South China Sea, with nine unconnected dashes marking the outer limits of its territory. The Philippine government hopes both public pressure and a favorable UN ruling will mitigate the overriding military muscle of China. The Aquino administration is also relying on the mutual defense treaty between it and the United States, in case armed conflict breaks out with its hugely powerful neighbor. President Aquino has likened the situation to Nazi Germany prior to World War II, urging the global community to help it stand up to China. In an in terview the president declared: “Remember that the Sudetenland was given in an at tempt to appease Hitler to prevent World War II.” Indeed, the rise of China as a preeminent force in the Asia Pacific region has resulted in the so-called U. S. “pivot” to ward Asia, to counterbalance China’s ascendance and aggressive posturing, which in cludes claiming airspace, or Air Defense Identification Zone, over islands controlled by Japan but whose sovereignty is questioned by China. The ADIZ also overlaps with South Korean airspace. The standoff with China has given the regular joint U. S.-RP military exercises, termed Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder), heightened importance. It has also led to a modest buildup of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Airforce. In early 2014, Manila contracted to purchase from South Korea 12 FA- 50 fighters as part of a five-year $1.68-billion modernization program, to bolster its defense capabilities. Delivery of the first jets is expected in late 2014. The government has hired U. S. defense contractor Raytheon to devise a system for maritime border security, and plans to acquire six unmanned drones for surveillance and reconnaissance. Further complicating relations with China has been the on going contretemps between the Special Autonomous Region of Hong Kong and the Philippines, stemming from the murder of Hong Kong to urists in Manila on August 23, 2010. On that day, Rolando Mendoza, an excop, age 55, armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, took a bus full of Hong Kong to urists as hostages, to demand his reinstatement in the Manila Police Department. In the botched at tempts to rescue the hostages, Mendoza killed eight to urists before he was shot dead. The handling by local authorities was severely criticized, and universally condemned as in ept, especially when it was revealed that a SWAT team was on hand but not called upon"

The Hong Kong government demanded an apology from President Aquino, who refused to do so. Talks over possible compensation for the victims’ families have yet to produce any progress. N ATURAL D ISASTERS On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (named Yolanda locally) the strongest typhoon recorded to ever make landfall, with the winds clocked at an astonishing 195 mph, struck the islands of Leyte and Samar in the Eastern Visayas to devastating effect: more than 6,000 dead, an estimated 6.6 million people displaced, 1.1 million homes destroyed or severely damaged, 33 million coconut trees downed or damaged, and 30,000 fishing vessels wrecked or swept away. An estimated $14 billion in damages were in curred, and national economic growth is projected to suffer a 1 percent decline in 2014. The hardest hit city was the capital of Leyte, Tacloban, with 90 percent of its buildings destroyed or severely damaged. The estimated period of recovery for the region is at least five years. The typhoon had come roaring out of the Eastern Pacific, right where the Eastern Visayas islands are, in an area dubbed “Typhoon Belt.” The fast-moving Yolanda kept barreling west, making four additional landfalls in the Visayas, then tacking slightly northwest before crossing the sea and hitting Vietnam, albeit in weakened form. Complicating immediate relief efforts was the fact that a great many of the first responders were the mselves affected by the storm. With a breakdown in law and or der, in evitably looting broke out, due to the dire circumstances and the survivors’ need to obtain food, clothing, and shelter. Yolanda came three weeks after an earthquake, in tensity 7.2 (the deadliest in 23 years), on October 15 struck the Visayan islands of Bohol and Cebu. More than 220 people died, and close to a thousand were in jured. More than 14,500 structures collapsed, among them, centuries-old churches. Damage was estimated at P 2.25 billion pesos, or approximately $50 million. While Haiyan did not directly strike the earthquake disaster zones, it further strained resources, though massive for eign aid did pour in. The extreme nature of the typhoon was exceptional. However, with weather patterns being affected by climate change, such typhoons may become the norm. The Philippine government, much-criticized for its relief and recovery efforts, has its work cut out as it seeks to prevent the kind of widespread havoc wreaked by Haiyan/Yolanda.

Going along with the group to preserve social harmony even if one’s own wishes must be sacrificed. Pananagutan",
      "Beyond ties of affinity, the traditional Filipino family was a source of economic security for its members. This economic function was certainly true in the culture’s rural and agrarian or igins where landownership was the key to survival. Land was usually passed from father to son and sometimes to a daughter and her husband. Families worked the soil to gether sharing the tasks and the rewards",
      "The popularity of the Tagalog pasyon soon spread throughout the colony and was translated into other Philippine dialects.13 While the dominant social values of humility and submission to authority were clear in all versions of the pasyon, in fact, other social values such as honor and goodness are also present in the story"

Legazpi and his men began a sustained and ultimately successful effort to colonize the islands, with the Spanish Basque becoming the first governor general of this latest addition to the Spanish Empire",

This was, with out doubt, the most important mission of the Legazpi-Urdaneta expedition. The Making of the Spanish “Indio”.—It was very easy, in deed, for Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who was granted by King Philip II, the peerless and single title of “Adelantado de Filipinas” to accomplish an almost “bloodless” conquest of the Philippines considering its physical and human geography",
      "Indeed,/the spiralling of the price of spices in Spain had been considered by some writers as one of the significant factors that pushed the Legazpi voyage. Fr. Andres de Urdaneta, Legazpi’s chief pilot, whose expertise of the seasonal winds he had acquired while with the Loaisa expedition, discovered the “Urdaneta Passage” on his return to Navidad via the Pacific.

    "model_answer": "The national language of the Philippines derived from Tagalog is called **Filipino**.  [Source: Filipino Politics, p. 43]",
    "contexts": [
      "Languages.--There are more than a hundred languages and dialects in the Philippines, eight of which may be considered major languages. They are Tagalog (made the basis of the Na¬ tion al Language), Iloko, Pangasinan,, Pampangan, Sugbuhanon, Hiligaynon, Samarnon or Samar-Leyte, and Magindanao. These languages are sister-languages whose lexicon shows that they are descended from one parent-stock, the Austronesian or Malayo- Polynesian language",
      "The Filipino Language.—The bitter controversy that arose from the national language issue led the authorities of the Depart¬ ment of Education to propose a solution by using Pilipino, in stead of Tagalog, as the national language. The reason is based not on any scientific explanation but on purely practical ground, namely, to neutralize the bull-headed opposition of the professional anti-Tagalog by not ment ioning the word Tagalog which, to the oppositionists, smacks of superiority",
      "On November 13, 1936, the Na¬ tion al Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 184 establish¬ ing the Institute of National Language tasked to study the dif¬ ferent Philippine languages for the purpose of evolving and adopt¬ ing a national language. On November 9, 1937, after serious consideration, the Institute of National Language recommended the adoption of Tagalog as the basis of the national language. On December 30, Quezon proclaimed the language based on Tagalog as the coun¬ try's national language",
      "The fear that linguistic cleavage might in hibit the growth of national identity provoked President Quezon in 1937 to designate Tagalog, the language of the Manila area, as the “National Language.” Somewhat modified, Tagalog is to day called “Filipino.” Tagalog has had substantial as- sistance from the media (especially movies and comics) and is now the most widely spoken language in the country, having surpassed English in the late 1950 s",
      "In April 1940, Quezon authorized the printing of a dictionary and grammar prepared by the Institute. Beginning on June 19, 1940, the national language was or dered taught in all schools in the Philippines. Through Commonwealth Act No. 570, the National Assembly declared that the Tagalog- based national language would become one of the of ficial lan¬ guages of the country effective upon in dependence on July 4, 1946"

Ape errhce EURATode Sae Teen cccctncestrereeeates 619 Vili ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO Foreword Rodrigo D. Perez, III The titleof thisbook—Arkitekturang Filipino—mayresurrectan old question: Is the resucha thingas Filipinoarchitecture? Can one speak of itas one speaks of Filipinomusic, Filipinodance, Filipinopainting, Filipinosculpture, Filipinoliterature, Filipinotheater, and Filipinocinema; thatisto say, as something recognizably Filipino, something thatreflectsthecultureand spiritofthe Filipinopeople? Itshouldn’tbe surprisingto hear vehement denialsof the existenceof Filipino architectureeven from academics and architects. The various. buildingsof the Spanish colonial, American colonial, and postcolonialperiodsaredismissedas mere imitationsof Western architecture. The in digenousdwellings, which developed from precolonialtraditions, arenot consideredarchitectureat allsincetheyare not monumental. Such judgments arisefrom plainignorance, a colonialmentality, and the nationalpropensityforself-bashing. Anyone who has diligentlyexamined the varioustypesofbuildings in thiscountryand has bothered to look in to their historywillrealizethatthereissuch a thingas Filipinoarchitecture. The author, Gerard Lico, has chosen a Filipinotitlefor abook thatisentirelyin English. Translatedinto English, the titlewould be either Filipino Architectureor Philippine Architecture.|sthereany difference? Inan articlepublishedin 1958, writer Danny Villanuevamade a distinction.“Philippinearchitecture”is“on lya genericterm we use to denote geography or the placewhere the buildingsare located.”Filipinoarchitecture, on the other hand, would be the term for that which istheappropnate responsetotheenvironmentand to the Filipino’sindividual and socialneeds. Itcouldbe understood asthereflectionand expressionofculture, which arisesfrom human beings’in teractionwith the irenvironment, with their history, and among the mselves. Inthebriefdescriptionof the book’scontent, the author usestheterm “Philippine architecture.”Being “geographical,”itiscomprehensive, and would the refore in cludeboth what istruly Filipinoarchitectureand what isnot. Historiesof Filipinoarchitecture—the term |prefer—which are contained in a number of books and essays, usuallyfocuson the evolutionofbuilding forms in the lightof political, economic, social, and culturaldevelopments, and on the synthesisofnative and for eignelements. Lico’shistoryisnot on lyan account of an evolution but also a critiqueof the succession of regimes. He shows how architecturehas been an in strumentofdomination and even in justice. The subject isnot only Artinallitssplendorbut also Power and itshidden ugliness: the power of colonialmasters, the power ofa dictator, and the power of global business. But, for tunately, power does notdestroythegeniusofthe Filipinoarchitect, whether unschooled or for mallytrained. To develop histhesis, Licohas assembled a vast amount of in for mation and commentary thatisboth enlighteningand in dicting. The saga beginswiththeearlypeoplesettlinginfound shelters—treesand caves. Nature herselfisthearchitectofthesedwellings. Indigenoushouses arerecognizedas architecture, although qualifiedby the term “vernacular.”Licoenablesthereaderto appreciatesuch buildingsnot on lyinthe Southeast Asian contextbut alsointhewider Austronesiancontext.

The colonizer’saccommodation to the environment and nativeculturegave birthto what was christenedarquitecturamestiza. Thisdevelopedintothebahay na bato. “Imperial Imaginings,”which coversthe American colonialperiod, focuseson Daniel Burnham’s plans for Manila and Baguio and the irimplementation by William Parsons. Baguio was to be developed for the comfort of the colonizers. Filipinoarchitectsof the period—Juan Arellano, Arcadio Arellano, Antonio Toledo, Tomas Mapua, Tomas Arguelles, Andres Luna de San Pedro, Juan Nakpil, Femando Ocampo, and Pablo Antonio—are highlightedinthischapter. The section on Art Deco shows how European stylewas “Filipinized.” The chapter “Postcolonial Modernity” in cludesthe period of reconstruction following World War Il, the planforthe Capital City, the architectureofgovernment buildings, low-costhousing, and the architecturalstylesand outstandingarchitects of the late 1940 sto the early 1970 s. “Vernacular Renaissance” begins with the buildingscommissioned during the Conjugal Dictatorship and, later, examines the various trends: Romantic Regionalism. Pragmatic Tropicalism, and Neovernacularism, represented respectivelyby Leandro Locsin, Felipe Mendoza, and Francisco Mafosa. Paradoxically, an eraof repressionspawned a Romantic movement. The lastchapter,“Architectureof Pluralism,”examines Postmodernism in the Philippines, the phenomenon of the malls, and the globalcitiesof Manila: Fort Bonifacio Global City, Rockwell Center, and Eastwood City Cyberpark. With globalization, more and more for eignarchitectshavebeen engaged to design major projectsinthe Philippinesincollaborationwith Filipinoarchitectswho are designated“architectsof record.”The reasonsforthisaremany and apparently convincing. One fears, however, thattheperiodof Postmodern architectureinthe Philippinesmight wellbecome the periodof Post-Filipinoarchitecture. But perhaps, one way or another, as in the past, the Filipinowillprevail. X ARKITEKTURANG FILIPINO Preface Architecturepossessesthe capabilityto reflecttheessenceof a time and a place likeno other artifact. Itnot only embodies the collectiveculturalvaluesof the societythat made itpossible, but alsopalpablymanifeststhe society’screative responsesto environmentalimperatives, the ecologicalmilieu, power structures, and even materialdeprivation. The Philippineshas longbeena locusofexchange and a crucibleofculturalcross- breedingbecauseofits geographiclocationand archipelagicopenness, which has resultedina wealth of architecturalexpressions. Thisbook presentsa wide range of builtforms, from the crudestmodes of human habitation, such as primeval caves, to the most sophisticatedartificialenvironments, such as postmodern megastructures. Architectureinthe Philippinesisextremelymultifaceted, mirroring the richdiversityofcultural, historical, and geographicinfluencesthathave for ged the Filipinonationas a whole.

There are as much archetypalforms of vernaculararchitectureas there are ethnolinguisticgroups in the Philippines. Due to thisculturaldiversity, in teresting forms and or namentation have emerged. The mountain people have developed architecturalforms differentfrom those who livealong the coastlineor on flat lands. Although, there isa strong commonality in the dispositionof spaces, “communal memory,” socialorganization, lifestyle, beliefsystem, exposure to for eign culture, natural environment, building technology, and available constructionmaterialscreatethe variationsacrossthe differentethnocultural communities.

The Filipino in dividualityismanifested by the architecturethatour ancestorshave created: overflowinginlightand air, generouslyembellished, and welcoming. Inthesixteenthcenturythe Spanish conquistadoresvanquished resistanceinthe archipelagothrough “the crossand the sword.” New forms of structureswere in troducedwhich were not essentialinthe early Filipinos’traditionalexistence. The new Roman Catholicbeliefsystembuiltsplendidchurches, conventos, and belltowers. Fortifications, codificationof town planning, civicstructures, lighthouses, bridges, and portoshoned ourancestors’constructionvocabularyto articulate Filipinoarchitecture. The lifestyleofthenew colonialmastersofworking and relaxingindoorswas so contraryto the Filipinos’preferredoutdoor existence. So even the new multiroomed bahay na bato, ceramic roof tiles,“stone and mortar” constructiontechniques, which createdwhat was calledarquitectura mestiza, emerged as Filipinoarchitecture.

The martyrdom of patriot Dr. Jose Rizalprovokedtherevolutionagainst Spainand in 1898, the Philippinerevolutionaryforcesdeclaredindependenceofthecountry from Spain. By a “quirkof an in ternationalaccident,”the Spanish-American War was resolvedwiththepurchaseofthe Philippinesfrom Spain by the United States. Intheraceforsupremacy among the colonialpowers, the additionofthe Philippines to the colonialcoffersofthe United Stateswas an opportunitytoassertdominance in the region. Asocietaltransformationand architecturaluniformitywere about to happen with the United Statesimposing the American Neoclassicstyleand Daniel H. Burnham’s built-environmentprescription. Plansfornew citiesand architecturewere for mally crafted. The Filipinoi/ustrados, some of whom were sent to study abroad as pensionados, worked with American architects. There were tremendous opportunitiesto launch projectsineducation, resourcedevelopment, publicworks, sanitationand publichealth, communication, transportation, and conservation.

Cave Dwellings as the Early Human Shelter Prehistoriccave shelterswere the earliestform of human habitation. The use of naturalcaves predated the emergence of Homo sapiens. Constructing cave dwellingsonly required minimal site-workand modification as the shelters conformed to the structuralpropertiesof rockor earthinsitu. The shelterswere made viaexcavationratherthan construction. Cave spaces were hollowed out eitherby extendingcavesor burrowing in to the recessesofthe cliffs, yieldingforits occupantsa livingspace protectedfrom heat, rain, and wind. In the Philippines, the earliestdwellersof caves were the Pleistocenepeople, of fspringsof the Ice Age. They had come on foot by way of land bridgesthat emerged when the seasubsidedbecause of the for mationofglaciersand the polar icecaps some two to halfa millionyearsago. The most antiquated, and perhaps the largest, cave periodicallydwelt in by prehistoricfamiliesforthirtythousand yearsisthe Tabon Cave complex, situated on Lipuun Point, southwestof Palawan. Itcovers 138 hectaresofrugged cliffsand deep slopes. Ahuman bone fossiltentativelydated from 22,000 to 24,000 years ago was discoveredin Tabon Cave in the 1960 s by a team of National Museum archeologistsheaded by the late Dr. Robert B. Fox. The cave’sportalisabout sixteenmetersinwidth and eightmetersinheightand extendsto an in teriordepth of forty-one meters. Verifiedthrough findingsfrom archeologicalexcavationsand carbon-14 datings, the cavewas found to have been suitableforhuman habitation. Infact, the cliffsand slopesaround the area are punctured with more than 200 caverns. Twenty-nineofthese caveswere fullyexploredand found to have been idealforhabitationor burialby ancient Filipinos.

Nomadism and Ephemeral Portable Architecture Ephemeral architecturewas one of the firstartifactscreated by humans. The primitivelifestylewas essentiallynomadic, needing a form of temporary shelter thatutilizedreadilyavailablematerialswith limitedinvestmentintime and energy. As nomadism entailedconstant movement, materialsthat were portableand demountable were requisitesindesignand construction. BETWEEN THE EARTH AND Sky 9 Inthe Philippines, the fundamental actof buildingwas practicedby nomads in the form of the windbreak (lean-to), windscreen, or windshield. Itwas setup for shelterbeforecommencing a huntingor food-gatheringjourney. Early Filipinos constructeda wind-sun-and-rainscreenanchoredby a poleorstickatan angleon the ground. The lean-to isthe early dwelling of the Aeta. This transient architecture isan in alienableaspect of their nomadic lifestyle. Itisstillvery popular among Aeta groups, although the acculturated Aeta of Pampanga and Zambales, not as nomadic as the irancestors, have chosen to settlein more permanent abodes, like the irstilthouses—structures raised above the ground on wooden posts with thatched roofs and walls.

He chooses four of the strongest and raises them perpendicular to the ground, to form a square. On these four he supports four others laid across them. The illustration, which accompanied this account, showed that these latter branches laidacross the fork of trees were stillrooted to the ground. Inthe nineteenthcentury, arborealsheltersreinforcedthe racialstereotypesof post-Darwinianevolutionaryconceptsas“climbingdown from trees,”representing the transitionof man from ape to sentienthuman being.

Inthe Philippines, the treehouse isan old in stitution, builtand used by the Gaddang and Kalingaof Luzon, the Manobo and Mandaya of Mindanao, and by the Maranao of Lake Lanao, accordingto Alfred Louis Kroeber (1928).

Although the historicalgenesisand age of the terracesare subjectto debate, modern datingtendsto support archeologist Henry O. Beyer’scontentionthatthe terraceshad existedat leastby 1000 BC. From 1964 to 1967, Robert Mahler, chairman of the Department of Anthropology, West Michigan University, collected charcoalspecimens of ricechafffrom a house terracein Banaue, which revealed the date 2950 BP or roughly 1000 BC.

The similarform isused to designatethe Badjao stilthouse (/uma) thatislocated in the waters of the sea near the shorelineand elevatedfrom the water by a number of major and minor posts, poles, and stilts. “Balay”takesa varietyof form in the Malayo-Polynesianand Oceanic languages. Inthe Philippines, reflexesofthisterm (Isneg, balay; Cebuano, balay)referto a “house,” while in Malay languages, the term balaisignifiesa “publicmeeting house.”Inthe Pacific, the reflexesofbalaydenote the same meaning astheydo in the Philippines(Fijian, vale; Samoan, fale; Hawaiian, hale). The thirdterm,“lepaw,”alsorefersto a house but assumesa varietyofmeanings: a “storehouseforgrain”(Ngaju,/epau); a “hut otherthan the longhouse” (Uma Juman, /épo); and a “back verandah or kitchenverandah of a Malay house, booth, or shop” (Malay, lepau). Inthe Philippines, the Badjao word /epadenotes a “long, slow-moving houseboat withno outrigger’; the structureofwhich isloose and detachable, with long polesattached in alldirectionsas a framework over which a nipa roof may be unrolled. The house term “kamalir”isadapted in the Philippinesas kamaligorkamarin that generallyrefersto a “granary, storehouse, or barn,”whereas in Oceanic language, itdenotes a special“men’s house.” Finally, the term “banua” occursinthe Malayo-Polynesianvocabularyinreference to the “house” (Toraja, banua; Banggai, bonua; Wolio, banua; Molima, vanua; Wosi-Mana, wanua). Farmore of ten, reflexesofbanua denote a terntorialdomain, such as “land, country, place, settlement, in habitedterritory, village.” PHILIPPINE VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE 23 Naga, an Austronesian Water Symbol The naga, Sanskrit for serpent, represents the cosmological model’s waveform as well as the universalityof water in the daily lifeof Southeast Asia. The said creature is aquatic in character, but also appears in hybrids. The Thai sang isa cross between a snake and a lion, and the Chinese and Japanese dragon isa flyingamphibian. However, the basic forms are primarilywave-likein nature, as seen in architecturalomamentation and building motifs where the naga is best exhibited in itswater element. Ss eee Panolong, a Maranao decorative beam end In the Pacificregion, the serpentine coilhas been used in house carving and in boat motifs since prehistorictimes.

This phenomenon stimulated on the Asian waterfronts a host of in terpretationsin terms of urban planning and architectureand in almost every art form and ritual, both sacred and profane. The naga motif predominates artifactssuch as Islamiccarvings in boats, musical in struments, grave markers, protrudingbeam ends, and designpatternsfound in woven textilesand wallornaments produced by Maranao, Samal, Tausug, and other Philippine Islamicgroups.

Inthe succeeding decades, steelreinforcementswere used. However, sincethese new materials, usuallyshipped from the neighboringislandof Luzon, were costlyand scarce, the productionofnative limeinkilnscontinued, and the Ivatanchose cogon overthe rust-pronegalvanizedironsheets. The use of cogon minimized the useofnails in the woodwork because the latterproved to be lessdurable because of eventual corrosion. Cordillera Houses William Henry Scott (1966) classifiedhouses in the mountain ranges of the Cordillerasin Luzon in to the northernstrainand the southern strain. According to Scott, the northern strainconsistsofhouses made by the Isnegand Kalinga. The southern strain, on the other hand, arethose constructed by the Ifugao, Bontoc, Ibaloi, and Kankanay. The northernstrainischaracterizedby houseswitha rectangularplancoveredby a highgableroof.

Bamboo Bamboo is found in large quantitiesnearly everywherein the archipelago. There are around thirty-twospeciesof bamboo in the Philippines. The commerciallyimportant bamboo speciesin the country are kauayan tinikor spiny bamboo (Bambusa lumeana); kauayan kiling(Bambusa vulgaris); Bayog (Dendrocalamus merrillianus); (Schizostachyum Iumampao). Among the five the preferred species for building, furniture making, and making boat outriggers. Bayog is used for tyingand making ropes. Bamboos are tall, tree-likegrasses. Mature bamboos are cut during dry season, or when the sap flow issluggishand sugar content islow—a condition where powder-post beetles,(Lyctus brunneus), locallycalledbukbok, are no longer drawn to itscane. To eliminate all in sects, bamboo canes are soaked in riveror lakewater or buried in the sand for some sixmonths priorto application. Bamboos can be used as fullcanes or splitlongitudinallyintohalvedor quarteredstrips or segments. The bamboo issplicedin thisway to maintain itsstructuralproperties. In the constructionof the bahay kubo, the bamboo performs as a structuralelement in the form of canes (for post, beams, and rails)or stiffeningframes (lattice), and as cladding material(for floors, walls, and fences)in the form of planks and latticepanels. The components can be easilyprefabricated, assembled, and replaced. Depending on the age and species, the bamboo can have variablediameters. Bamboos having diametersof fiveto twelvecentimetersare commonly utilizedfor building. Aside from being cheap, readilyavailable, and easilymanipulated with basictools, a variable cross-sectionaldiameter and an abilityto grow fastmake bamboo a popular building material. Cogon (Imperata cylindrica) Cogon isa perennialthatgrows in dense clusters to a heightof 1.8-2 meterswith narrow, rigidleaf- blades. Although in fenorto nipa, it Isefficientfor thatching and iswidely used wherever nipa is unavailable. Notwithstanding itsarchitectural application, cogon isused for soilerosioncontrol, mulch in coffeeplantations, fodder, papermaking, packaging, fuel, and or namental purposes. The rhizomes and root extractsare used medicinally. To make a thatched roof, the cogon Isfirstmade to dry. Bundling the dried grass follows aftera few days.

From the nipa’sstalk, sap isextractedand made into alcohol, vinegar, wine, and sugar. Kernels of young nuts of nipa are made into sweets and preserves. The nipa palm isbelievedto be one of the oldestand most extensivepalms of the world, Found in India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and in some other Pacific islands, nipa isadapted to muddy soilsalong rivers and estuaries. In the Philippines, nipa isplanted in the months of May and August, at the heightof the rainyseason, when the soilissaturatedwith moisture. When mature, thisplant grows to about 3-3.5 meters in heightand itslong pinnate leavesacquire a richgreen color. Nipa as thatching materialisgenerallyregarded as superiorto coconut or cogon thatch because itperforms betterin repellingrainwater and of fershigherresistanceto rotting. Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera) The coconut palm may have or iginated in South America or Oceania, but itiswidespread throughout the Philippines, Malaysia, and India. They can grow at high altitudes, and flourishat sea level, liningisland coastsand bays. The trunksmay grow to as much as thirtymeters high and forty-fivecentimetersor more in diameter. Itshuge leavesbunched at the crestof the treeare used in itsentiretywith layersplaced from ridgeto eaves, or the leafletstrippedfrom the ribs, relaidand in terwoven to make a more permanent roofcladding. Coco lumber isalsoextensivelyused for house posts, roof frames, and scaffolding. Rattan (Calamus) The rattan is a climbing palm that provides raw matenal for vernacularbuildingsand the cane-furnitureindustry. Itisthe most important for estproduct in the country aftertimber. In the Philippines, rattanisrepresentedby sixty-twospecies, of which twelveare of commercial value. Rattan has long and very flexible stems that need support. It is harvested every fifteen years when the stems have grown to an average length of twenty-five meters and a diameter of 1.5-3.5 centimeters. Afterwards, selective cutting of mature canes is done at a three- to four-year-gap. Rattan gatherersneed to pullthe canes down from the for estcanopy and remove the spinysheaths, leaves, and whips, leavinga bare cane. Rattan harvestingis, thus, a ratherdangerous undertaking—dead branches can be dislodgedas the rattanispulledand ants and wasps can of tenbe disturbedinthe process. The bare canes are carried out of the for est and partially processed; small-diametercanes are dried in the sun and of ten smoked, while largecanes are boiledin oil (of ten a mixture of dieseland palm oil)to remove excess moisture and natural gums and to prevent at tackby wood-boring beetles.

Postwar slummification is best captured in Lamberto Avellana’s classic Anak Dalita (1956). The story revolves around a Korean war veteran and a prostitute trying to survive poverty in the war-ravaged slum of Manila. Using a style derived from Italian neorealism, Avellana’s film takes us to the world of the walled slum of Intramuros, in the bombed-out shell of the church where each shanty at taches itselfto the brick wall of the church ruins for structural support. Malvarosa (1958), directedby Gregorio Fernandez, underscores a visualmotif of the railroadtracksthat run, not justthrough the community, but alsothrough the livesof itscharacters.

These tradersestablishedtradingcentersin Southeast Asiaas the irregularcommercial stopoverson the irway to China. But with the politicalupheaval in South China during the laterperiod of the T’ang dynasty, for eignmerchants, in cludingthe Arabs, were expelledfrom China. They sought asylum in variousareasof Southeast Asia, principallyin Malaysia, awaitingthe restorationoforder in China and the resumption of normal commercial tieswith the Chinese. In the in terim, these tradersestablishednew economic routesin the adjacent islandsof Insular Southeast Asia. As tradebecame firmlyentrenched, the stations of commerce developedintoportsand businesshubs. Soon after, the Arab traders for gedeconomic relationsamong the wealthy nativepopulation. Marriage with the richnativesand localheadmen guaranteed the permanent consolidationof the irbusinesspartnership, of tentakingthedaughterofthe localchiefwho himself convertedto Islam. In these trade centers, the need for Muslim education was soon felt. Muslim teachers and missionaries were also among the firsttransmitters of Islamic religion. They came from the Arab region, such as Baghdad. Duringthelastquarterofthe thirteenthcentury, ifnot earlier, a Muslim community in Sulu alreadyexisted. Historically, the in troductionand diffusionof Islam in the Philippinesisattributedto Tuan Masha’ika and laterto Karim ul-Mahkdum, the leadingfiguresinthe Islamizationof Sulu, who came to ment or the childrenofthe richmerchants of Suluand assimilateallthe people in the areato the message of Allah. Infact, the firstto convertto Islamwere the tradingpartnersof the Muslim merchants. With the arrivalofmore Islamicteachers, the faithspread rapidlyand reached as faras Luzon. There isno historicalevidencethat the nativepeople resistedthecoming ofa new religion.

The Royal Ordinance encapsulated, in additionto the actualplanningexperience encountered in the Americas, the classicisttheoriesofurban designproposed by the Roman architect Vitruviusand the Italian Renaissancearchitect Leon Battista Alberti. The urban prescription, likethatof Vitruvius, exhibited“a keen awareness of the functionofopen squares as essentialarenas of economic and sociallife, as wellas placesforthe exposure of monumental edifices”(Reed 1978, 41). The lengthyurban statutesprovided overseascolonialadministratorsusefulmodels for the design of town and urban sitesforboth in landand coastalgeography. Colonialcitiesinthe Philippineswere, hence, builtaccordingto rulescodifiedin the Laws of the Indiesof 1573, specifyingan elevatedlocation, an or derlygridof streetswith a centralplaza, a defensivewall, and zones for churches, shops, government buildings, hospitals, and slaughterhouses. The “plaza complex” evolved, which consistedof a grid patternwith the main plaza at the center surrounded by the church-convent, the tribunal, and otherimportantgovernment buildings, and the marketplace. Houses of varioussocialclassesare usually hierarchicallydistributedaround thiscomplex. As the settlementsexpanded, secondaryplazaswere establishedindifferentareas.

The Great Urban and Architectural Transformation A decade afterthefounding of the city, Manila could layclaimto the possession of urban elementscommon with most established Hispaniccities. The cityquarter was surrounded bya spikedlogpalisade. There was a centralplaza, a cabildo(a municipal building), and a generalmarket. As a portcity, Manila had a wooden portand a garrisonofsoldiers. The residencesof the Governor-Generaland of the Bishop were alsolocatedin it. The cathedralwas under constructionand was made of wood boards. The houses of the to wnsfolkoccupied the restof the area followingthegridstreetsystem. Manila was not spared itsshareofdisastersand tribulations. Forone, the citywas persistentlypreyed upon by piratesfrom the sea, such as thatwhich Limahong launched in 1574.

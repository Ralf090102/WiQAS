[Enabled Toggle Names]
----------------------
*   lazy_clear_resource_on_first_use: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/145):
    Clears resource to zero on first usage. This initializes the resource so
    that no dirty bits from recycled memory is present in the new resource.

*   disable_indexed_draw_buffers: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/582):
    Disables the use of indexed draw buffer state which is unsupported on some
    platforms.

*   flush_before_client_wait_sync: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/633):
    Call glFlush before glClientWaitSync to work around bugs in the latter

*   disallow_spirv: 
    (https://crbug.com/1214923):
    Disallow usage of SPIR-V completely so that only WGSL is used for shader
    modules. This is useful to prevent a Chromium renderer process from
    successfully sending SPIR-V code to be compiled in the GPU process.

*   use_placeholder_fragment_in_vertex_only_pipeline: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/136):
    Use a placeholder empty fragment shader in vertex only render pipeline.
    This toggle must be enabled for OpenGL ES backend, the Vulkan Backend, and
    serves as a workaround by default enabled on some Metal devices with Intel
    GPU to ensure the depth result is correct.

*   timestamp_quantization: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1800):
    Enable timestamp queries quantization to reduce the precision of timers
    that can be created with timestamp queries.

*   use_blit_for_buffer_to_stencil_texture_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1389):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy buffer data to the stencil
    aspect of a texture. Works around an issue where stencil writes by copy
    commands are not visible to a render or compute pass.

*   use_blit_for_depth16unorm_texture_to_buffer_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1782):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy depth aspect of a texture to
    a buffer.Workaround for OpenGL and OpenGLES.

*   use_blit_for_depth32float_texture_to_buffer_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1782):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy depth aspect of a texture to
    a buffer.Workaround for OpenGLES.

*   use_blit_for_stencil_texture_to_buffer_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1782):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy stencil aspect of a texture
    to a buffer.Workaround for OpenGLES.

*   use_blit_for_snorm_texture_to_buffer_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1781):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy snorm texture to a
    buffer.Workaround for OpenGLES.

*   use_blit_for_rgb9e5ufloat_texture_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/2079):
    Use a blit instead of a copy command to copy rgb9e5ufloat texture to a
    texture or a buffer.Workaround for OpenGLES.

*   gl_use_array_length_from_uniform: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/379805731):
    Use arrayLengthFromUniform transform to replace arrayLength() function
    calls of dynamic storage buffers.This toggle is only used for workarounds
    on certain devices. It has no impact on backends which need this transform
    universally (metal, d3d12)

*   use_t2b2t_for_srgb_texture_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/2362):
    Use T2B and B2T copies to emulate a T2T copy between sRGB and non-sRGB
    textures.Workaround for OpenGLES.

[WebGPU Required Toggles - enabled]

[Enabled Toggle Names]
----------------------
*   lazy_clear_resource_on_first_use: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/145):
    Clears resource to zero on first usage. This initializes the resource so
    that no dirty bits from recycled memory is present in the new resource.

*   use_d3d12_resource_heap_tier2: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/27):
    Enable support for resource heap tier 2. Resource heap tier 2 allows
    mixing of texture and buffers in the same heap. This allows better heap
    re-use and reduces fragmentation.

*   use_d3d12_residency_management: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/193):
    Enable residency management. This allows page-in and page-out of resource
    heaps in GPU memory. This component improves overcommitted performance by
    keeping the most recently used resources local to the GPU. Turning this
    component off can cause allocation failures when application memory
    exceeds physical device memory.

*   disallow_spirv: 
    (https://crbug.com/1214923):
    Disallow usage of SPIR-V completely so that only WGSL is used for shader
    modules. This is useful to prevent a Chromium renderer process from
    successfully sending SPIR-V code to be compiled in the GPU process.

*   timestamp_quantization: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1800):
    Enable timestamp queries quantization to reduce the precision of timers
    that can be created with timestamp queries.

*   apply_clear_big_integer_color_value_with_draw: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/537):
    Apply the clear value of the color attachment with a draw call when load
    op is 'clear'. This toggle is enabled by default on D3D12 backends when we
    set large integer values (> 2^24 or < -2^24 for signed integer formats) as
    the clear value of a color attachment with 32-bit integer or unsigned
    integer formats because D3D12 APIs only support using float numbers as
    clear values, while a float number cannot always precisely represent an
    integer that is greater than 2^24 or smaller than -2^24). This toggle is
    also enabled on Intel GPUs on Metal backend due to a driver issue on Intel
    Metal driver.

*   disable_sub_allocation_for_2d_texture_with_copy_dst_or_render_attachment: 
    (https://crbug.com/1237175):
    Disable resource sub-allocation for the 2D texture with CopyDst or
    RenderAttachment usage. Due to driver issues, this toggle is enabled by
    default on D3D12 backends using Intel Gen9.5 or Gen11 GPUs, on Vulkan
    backends using Intel Gen12 GPUs, and D3D12 backends using AMD GPUs.

*   d3d12_use_root_signature_version_1_1: 
    (https://crbug.com/tint/1890):
    Use D3D12 Root Signature Version 1.1 to make additional guarantees about
    the descriptors in a descriptor heap and the data pointed to by the
    descriptors so that the drivers can make better optimizations on them.

*   d3d12_use_64kb_alignment_msaa_texture: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/282):
    Create MSAA textures with 64KB
    (D3D12_SMALL_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) alignment.

*   d3d12_create_not_zeroed_heap: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/484):
    Create D3D12 heap with D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_CREATE_NOT_ZEROED when it is
    supported. It is safe because in Dawn we always clear the resources
    manually when needed.

*   polyfill_packed_4x8_dot_product: 
    (https://crbug.com/tint/1497):
    Always use the polyfill version of dot4I8Packed() and dot4U8Packed().

[Enabled Toggle Names]
----------------------
*   lazy_clear_resource_on_first_use: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/145):
    Clears resource to zero on first usage. This initializes the resource so
    that no dirty bits from recycled memory is present in the new resource.

*   use_d3d12_resource_heap_tier2: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/27):
    Enable support for resource heap tier 2. Resource heap tier 2 allows
    mixing of texture and buffers in the same heap. This allows better heap
    re-use and reduces fragmentation.

*   use_d3d12_residency_management: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/193):
    Enable residency management. This allows page-in and page-out of resource
    heaps in GPU memory. This component improves overcommitted performance by
    keeping the most recently used resources local to the GPU. Turning this
    component off can cause allocation failures when application memory
    exceeds physical device memory.

*   disallow_spirv: 
    (https://crbug.com/1214923):
    Disallow usage of SPIR-V completely so that only WGSL is used for shader
    modules. This is useful to prevent a Chromium renderer process from
    successfully sending SPIR-V code to be compiled in the GPU process.

*   timestamp_quantization: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1800):
    Enable timestamp queries quantization to reduce the precision of timers
    that can be created with timestamp queries.

*   apply_clear_big_integer_color_value_with_draw: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/537):
    Apply the clear value of the color attachment with a draw call when load
    op is 'clear'. This toggle is enabled by default on D3D12 backends when we
    set large integer values (> 2^24 or < -2^24 for signed integer formats) as
    the clear value of a color attachment with 32-bit integer or unsigned
    integer formats because D3D12 APIs only support using float numbers as
    clear values, while a float number cannot always precisely represent an
    integer that is greater than 2^24 or smaller than -2^24). This toggle is
    also enabled on Intel GPUs on Metal backend due to a driver issue on Intel
    Metal driver.

*   d3d12_use_64kb_alignment_msaa_texture: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/282):
    Create MSAA textures with 64KB
    (D3D12_SMALL_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) alignment.

*   d3d12_create_not_zeroed_heap: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/484):
    Create D3D12 heap with D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_CREATE_NOT_ZEROED when it is
    supported. It is safe because in Dawn we always clear the resources
    manually when needed.

*   polyfill_packed_4x8_dot_product: 
    (https://crbug.com/tint/1497):
    Always use the polyfill version of dot4I8Packed() and dot4U8Packed().

*   d3d12_polyfill_pack_unpack_4x8: 
    (https://crbug.com/tint/1497):
    Always use the polyfill version of pack4xI8(), pack4xU8(),
    pack4xI8Clamp(), unpack4xI8() and unpack4xU8() on D3D12 backends. Note
    that these functions are always polyfilled on all other backends right
    now.

*   d3d12_relax_buffer_texture_copy_pitch_and_offset_alignment: 
    (https://crbug.com/381000081):
    Don't require the alignments of D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PITCH_ALIGNMENT (256)
    for row pitch and D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT (512) for offset
    in buffer-texture copies.

----------------------
*   lazy_clear_resource_on_first_use: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/145):
    Clears resource to zero on first usage. This initializes the resource so
    that no dirty bits from recycled memory is present in the new resource.

*   use_temporary_buffer_in_texture_to_texture_copy: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/42):
    Split texture-to-texture copy into two copies: copy from source texture
    into a temporary buffer, and copy from the temporary buffer into the
    destination texture when copying between compressed textures that don't
    have block-aligned sizes. This workaround is enabled by default on all
    Vulkan drivers to solve an issue in the Vulkan SPEC about the
    texture-to-texture copies with compressed formats. See #1005
    (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1005) for more
    details.

*   vulkan_use_d32s8: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/286):
    Vulkan mandates support of either D32_FLOAT_S8 or D24_UNORM_S8. When
    available the backend will use D32S8 (toggle to on) but setting the toggle
    to off will make it use the D24S8 format when possible.

*   vulkan_use_s8: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/666):
    Vulkan has a pure stencil8 format but it is not universally available.
    When this toggle is on, the backend will use S8 for the stencil8 format,
    otherwise it will fallback to D32S8 or D24S8.

*   disallow_spirv: 
    (https://crbug.com/1214923):
    Disallow usage of SPIR-V completely so that only WGSL is used for shader
    modules. This is useful to prevent a Chromium renderer process from
    successfully sending SPIR-V code to be compiled in the GPU process.

*   vulkan_use_demote_to_helper_invocation_extension: 
    (https://crbug.com/42250787):
    Sets the use of the vulkan demote to helper extension

*   use_placeholder_fragment_in_vertex_only_pipeline: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/136):
    Use a placeholder empty fragment shader in vertex only render pipeline.
    This toggle must be enabled for OpenGL ES backend, the Vulkan Backend, and
    serves as a workaround by default enabled on some Metal devices with Intel
    GPU to ensure the depth result is correct.

*   timestamp_quantization: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1800):
    Enable timestamp queries quantization to reduce the precision of timers
    that can be created with timestamp queries.

*   use_vulkan_zero_initialize_workgroup_memory_extension: 
    (https://crbug.com/dawn/1302):
    Initialize workgroup memory with OpConstantNull on Vulkan when the Vulkan
    extension VK_KHR_zero_initialize_workgroup_memory is supported.
